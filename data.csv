0,Good course. Learned a lot from it. Thanks!
1,This course was great! With good code examples and algorithm applications and also intuition!It's a shame that we couldn't finish planned courses due to busy schedules of instructors as I was really looking forward to the capstone project! 
2,Nice course with all the practical stuffs and nice analysis about each topic but practical part of LDA was restricted for GraphLab users only which is a weak fallback and rest everything is fine.
3,Clustering &amp; Retrieval was a lot tougher compared to courses on regression &amp; classification because the match concepts behind this course were too complex. Nevertheless Emily tried to make this course as intuitive as possible
4,I'm a grad student and I can notice the instructor makes a difference in this course. I fully recommend it.
5,awesome course!
6,"sometimes difficult,but import so many useful knowledge"
7,"The materials presented are excellent with well prepared skeleton codes for all ML models. Comparing this course to its three preceding ones, this course is more challenging both conceptually and computationally. The slight drawback is that, because of the highly technical nature of the last three weeks' materials, there isn't enough guidance about how one may construct the ML algorithms from scratch, that is, learners with less experience in computing will, more or less, have to accept the sample codes with little confidence about how to (re)write such codes in the first place.As a result, I believe that learners with more experience in algorithms and data structure (or learners who proceed to learn more about this area) are likely to gain more from this course for at least two reasons: i) they are more comfortable with the complicated ML algorithms; ii) they can improve the algorithms to speed up the estimation time (some advanced techniques are quite computationally expensive, say over 20 minutes).In general, I have learnt very much from this course and love it."
8,I liked the slides.
9,very good! strongly recommend to people who want to start a career on data science or are interested in it
10,The teachers are really amazing. They do not just explain it as if they read a book. They explain the concepts very well
11,Overall is great. The LDA and Dendrograms lack quality/specificity and depth of the previous topics. So sad the Specialization collapsed at 4 courses instead of 6.
12,This course was my first encounter with Machine Learning! The course gave me a good understanding of the different ML algorithms used in clustering and retrieval of data! 
13,Very nice course. Concepts are covered very clearly.
14,"For me, this was the toughest of the first four courses in this specialization (now that the last two are cancelled, these are the only four courses in the specialization). I'm satisfied with what I gained in the process of completing these four courses. While I've forgotten most of the details, especially those in the earlier courses, I now have a clearer picture of the lay of the land and am reasonably confident that I can use some of these concepts in my work. I also recognize that learning of this kind is a life-long process. My plan next is to go through [https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370], which, based on my reading of the first chapter, promises to be an excellent way to review and clarify the concepts taught in these courses.What I liked most about the courses in this specializations are: good use of visualization to explain challenging concepts and use of programming exercises to connect abstract discussions with real-world data. What I'd have liked to have more of is exercises that serve as building blocks -- these are short and simple exercises (can be programming or otherwise) that progressively build one's understanding of a concept before tackling real-world data problems. edX does a good job in this respect.My greatest difficulty was in keeping the matrix notations straight. I don't have any linear algebra background beyond some matrix mathematics at the high school level. That hasn't been much of a problem in the earlier three courses, but in this one I really started to feel the need to gain some fluency in linear algebra. [There's an excellent course on the subject at edX: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1%3AUTAustinX%2BUT.5.05x%2B1T2017/ and I'm currently working through it.]Regardless of what various machine learning course mention as prerequisites, I think students would benefit from first developing a strong foundation in programming (in this case Python), calculus, probability, and linear algebra. That doesn't mean one needs to know these subjects at an advanced level (of course, the more the better), but rather that the foundational concepts are absolutely clear. I'm hoping this course at Coursera would be helpful in this regard: https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills/"
15," Really a good course, succinct and concise. "
16,slightly repetitive of classification course with no real use-case value except lots of math..
17,"Great course on machine learning, however, left us in middle of learning, Recommender System + Deep Learning Capstone is missing"
18,Some themes are shown very superficially it would be great to go deeper. Despite of this the course is great! Thanks.
19,The course was very engaging and mathematically intensive. It provides background for all the necessary tools one must know to start clustering. Great Course. Will miss this course format as 5 and 6 are cancelled! 
20,Should use pandas instead of Graph Lab Create
21,Good and deep dive into ML!Absolutely disappointed that the course was delayed and the promise to take it through Course 5 and Capstone Project didn't come through.Not at all happy with that!! 
22,"super one, "
23, Best Course on ML yet on the Web 
24,"A great course as the other 3 courses in the specialization.This course introduces and make us implement Knn,Kd trees,Gaussian Mixture model and LDA model for clustering and retrieval.The data set is the peoples wiki from the Foundations course and theres a assignment on clustering images too.If you have taken the other 3 an do this with ease and if you haven't taken those i think it will be better to take this course after the other 3."
25,Excellent course! Thanks a lot for the effort in compiling this course... I really enjoyed it!
26,"Dependence on GraphLab technology is a big minus. The lectures are poorly balanced in terms of difficulty. Apart from that - interesting course, I'm glad I took it."
27,"If you are considering this specialization I would recommend the Andrew Ng course instead and the main reason is that it isn't depend on proprietary ML framework. Despite the good lectures, the assignments don't help you develop the knowledge required for ML developer role.Taking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery, from summer 2016 to summer 2017, finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled. I'm completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience."
28, Not happy about course 5 &amp; 6 got cancelled. 
29,No good without the missing course and capstone projects
30,"The material is complex and challenging, but the teaching procedure is carefully thought out in a way that you quickly get it, giving you a great sense of accomplishment."
31, Excellent Course!!! 
32,"Very sophisticated, friendly and practical instructions"
33,Enjoyed the course and learned a lot. Amazing! 
34,awesome clustering course
35, This specialization is delayed for months now - very annoying! Don't give them money! 
36,very helpful
37,"I give 5 star for the teacher, really approach having such a well-organized teaching material.I also give -1 star for the homework assignment and its (almost) GraphLab only approach. Yes, it mentioned alternative approach (which is much more popular than GraphLab), but there are many bugs &amp; trivial difficulties to get it through. With scikit-learn as a great open source package, the only reason (I suspect) to choose GraphLab is commercial purpose. For me, if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into Pandas, I can finish each programming assignment within 1 hour for sure using scikit learn; but now, it takes 30 minutes and I still cannot load the data correctly. I like to get a certificate, but it is not necessary and spending too much time is a waste on my time. "
38,Great course but hard going at times for those of us without a strong maths background. The assignments took me a long time to complete and I think I'll have to revisit some areas as I become more familiar with them to really get the full benefit.
39,"I am taking all courses in the specialization, and this is my fourth. I have been having a great time with materials by both instructors so far, until I came to week 5 of this course.Despite repeated viewing, my understanding of LDA is non-existent. The first section is fine, but starting from Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling, for me at least, the method of instruction has gone off a cliff.I strongly suggest soliciting feedback from learners that narrowly targets the material of this week 5 to determine if it's just me or if this is a wider problem. If it is the latter, perhaps it is time to redesign the lessons of this week."
40,great.
41,VERY IMPRESSIVE COURSE
42,This course contain many advance topic which was covered in fast pace by the professor special end lectures. This course contain very important topics of Machine learning could have given more time in explaining things. Thanks professor 
43," I have enrolled myself in the other Machine Learning courses offered by Uwash , but have to say this was not properly organized. I had got my certificates for the other courses easily , not because the contents was easy , but was easily understandable and well organized and there was a great sense of satisfaction after getting the certificate because of the knowledge gained.But unfortunately for this course , especially the week 4 and week 5 was lengthy and not up to the point and the quizzes were hence not seem to be related. So got my certificate after a bit of struggle. I'm planning to see other online materials related to week 4 and week 5 , as couldn't completely understand from this one. If you can modify those two weeks, it would be great. I hope you continue the great work of illuminating millions of young people's interests through your great courses and organization. Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
44,Excellent course 
45,It is explained in simple and lucid language by expert Emily and codes illustrated by Carlos. Go for it.
46,Very Insightful. Great Instructors. Awesome Forum and intelligible peers. 
47,It's an amazing Course.
48,So Much Concepts to learn and totally worth it!
49,"Comme les pr??c??dents dans de cette sp??cialisation, ce cours est tr??s riche et donne les cl??s pour utiliser des outils complexes et puissants. Toutefois, un peu plus de d??tails sur certains aspects, notamment th??oriques, pourraient am??liorer la compr??hension de certains chapitres plus techniques."
50,"This was probably the most challenging course of them all, I thoroughly enjoyed it! Looking forward to dimensionality reduction and the capstone. "
51,"Thank you, it was a good one"
52,Great course! Very simple and practical.
53,"The course dived into basic and advanced concepts of unsupervised learning. As before, Prof Fox did a great job at explaining things."
54,this is not a an easy course but certainly an awesome one 
55,Excellent! Very good material and lectures and hands on. Really enriching.
56,"Very good, not only learn many good ML concepts, but also polish my python programming skill a lot. Thank you, Emily and Carlos."
57,"Great course, very hands-on, very practical knowledge."
58,Best course available till date as MooC
59,This was another great course. I hope that the instructors indulge in a little bit more theory. Anyway it was a magnificent course. Hope the coming courses are as good as this one.
60,Deep insight into most useful techniques of machine learning.
61,This specific course traded off depth and detail for breadth of topics. Too many ideas were quickly described and not really built up to my liking.
62,"I found that Week 4, Assignment 2 was testing our knowledge in ways that are in opposition to the general ethos of the course.I mean that this course is about gaining insight, intuition and the practical tools for ML, where the smaller details like - knowing which numpy function gives you a random univariate normal distribution - are normally provided for us, so that we can focus on the aforementioned broader, more useful aspects of ML/Clustering.The assignment had good content on the whole but the parts which were chosen for write code here could certainly be improved.I hope this is useful feedback and that the assignment is reviewed so that it doesn't needlessly discourage people."
63,great!
64,Very Good in depth explanation and hand-on lab machine learning course. very focused on real world analytics and algorithms
65,I loved this course. then content is designed to acquire strong foundations in clustering.
66,"I really learn a lot in this course, although the materials are very difficult at first read, but Emily's explanation were clear and I would be able to get the idea after a few review."
67,Great intro!
68,From LDA onwards the pace ramped up ! Please be slow during advance topics. But altogether it was a great course.
69,ok
70,Excellent course - and of great practical use.
71,"All the courses in this specialization are great, but compared to the other 3 i did until now, this one seemed a bit short on material. Especially week 1, and somewhat week 6 was without good material. Weeks 2, 3 and 4 were great. I got lost somewhere in week 5 on collapsed Gibbs sampling.Still: very much recommend this course, it provides a good introduction to Nearest Neighors, K-Means, Gaussian Mixtures and LDA. Thx prof. Fox!!"
72,"For me, this course was disappointing. Here is why: First, the level, at which the course material is presented, is very low. It might be freshman level, but certainly not more. There are many buzzwords but no real explanations. The programming assignments are only doable because most of the work has been done by the people designing the assignments. There is very little left for the students. Furthermore, the procedures, that are already given, are not very well documented. Hence, a lot of guess work is required to figure out how things should work. Furthermore, little effort has been spent to structure the procedures that are already given. Altogether, this makes doing the programming assignments very unsatisfying.Finally, the professor presenting the materials does not take part in the discussion forums. Contrary to other courses that I have attended at Coursera, this time the discussion forum was no help at all."
73,The material covered in this course is immense and gives a deep understanding of several algorithms required to perform unsupervised learning tasks. 
74,"This course was awesome as all the previous courses, I'm waiting to the next course and the capstone"
75,Detailed coverage of several approaches to clustering. Not easy but learned a lot.
76,Awesome :)
77,"Feels like this course in the specialization was a bit rushed, compared to the first 3 courses. It had 2 modules (first &amp; last) that were more like placeholders and the middle 4 modules went from concept to the maths behind the algorithm very quickly. It needs a bit of work on expanding the course and presenting a bit more slowly. Having said all that, the concepts and algorithms taught are very interesting and a good first step into the unsupervised learning section."
78,One of the best machine learning course I have taken.
79,"Another super course. Though admittedly (for me at least) very difficult to make within the allotted time given for one period of the Course. Lots of advanced stuff that require substantial studies to really comprehend, i.e., it should never be enough just to hack &amp; run the code (that's the easier challenge). Still have a long washing list of topics coming out of this Course that I need (want) to understand better. But at least the background to do so is neatly provided here. So without further ado ... Applause!"
80,wonderful course for beginner of machine learning.
81,Excellent course. 
82,"Some of the interesting topics discussed in this course could be treated substantially more extensive and detailed in order to get a better grip and understanding on them (e.g. Gibbs sampling). After this course, it is a bit dazzling how much different algorithms and methods are available for clustering and retrieval tasks and this course easily could have been subdivided into two or three separate courses on the same topic with a more detailed treatment. Still, about many interesting subjects a tip of the iceberg has been brought to you ... it tastes so good that you would like to have much more!"
83,"Amazing course, really helpful, as a ML researcher you need this kind of foundation"
84,"The best course in the specialization thus far. Very rich and wide ranging, perfect for the motivated part-time learner who wants to be challenged and have ample reason to revisit the material. I only wish this course had been longer, perhaps shortening the classification course to make room."
85,a practical and interesting course about clustering and retrival
86,"The assignments are excellent and help understand the algorithms and concepts taught in the course. There are some garbling in the subtitles/transcripts (including the quirky one that every time the lecturer says EM - the EM doesn't appear, and the following word is capitalized). As usual Graphlab Create / Sframes can't handle apply(). however mostly apply() appears in the part of the assignment that inputs files and turns them into data matrices and the explanations how to run the assignment with Scikit-Learn include pre-computed input files"
87,"As someone very keen on math, more math background as optimal video would be more helpful. "
88,"Great course and awesome teaching by Prof. Emily Fox. Prof. Fox did a great job of teaching some of the really tough components (GMM, LDA, etc) in simple and lucid style (like always) and that made it easy to understand and comprehend those topics.The one thing that I felt had gone down compared to the previous 3 courses was that for some of the topics, the material felt too short and felt like it was cut down to fit within the 6 weeks course duration. I would have at least liked some extra reading material or references especially for GMMs, LDA, Gibbs Sampling, etc."
89,Excellent course! Subjects are explained very well! Excellent quizzes that allow understanding of lectures better and excellent (challenging ) programming assignments.
90,Good course!
91,Great! thanks
92,Best Course.
93,Excellent course
94,Very good course!
95,"Overall a good and useful course, however: A) They could do a much better job regarding LDA, standard Gibbs sampling, and Bayesian model and inference. Many slides on these 3 topics only contained some text and the instructor tried to verbally visualize the related important concepts. Hence not a good use of a video session. B) Week 1 and the 1st half of Week 6 were redundant.C) It would be much better to have a 7-week course with more topics and may be with some optional videos on Bayesian model, HMM."
96,"Good survey of the material, but assignments are superficial and don't test thorough understanding."
97,Worth the wait. COOL learning
98,Best course I've taken!! :)
99,Simply Amazing!
100,"Following the overall quality of this Specialization, this course was excellent. From the content, to the assesments, material and teachers. This course is a really good starting point to become an expert in Machine Learning techniques."
101,Awesome course! The session on EM algorithm is revealing!
102,A little too superficial and hand waving.
103,"The last weeks, we went through the material a little bit too fast."
104,the homework is getting easy
105,"This course has been an amazing experience. Congrats to you, Carlos and Emmy!"
106,strongly recommended!
107,Fantastic course as usual
108,"The retrieval part of this course is great, it deserve five starts. The clustering part was going well until it reached LDA. The LDA module is very poorly covered, and also very hard to understand. I had to watch the videos more than two times to try to figure out what was LDA, and a Quora article posted in the Forum could explain it much better.Then we get to the Hierarchical Clustering module, which was the most poorly module in all this specialization. There is only one video talking about HMM models, and Markov Chains deserve at least one week to even get started with it. And to complete, there is just one Assignment with only 3 questions.The specialization was going perfect until now. I am very disappointed with this course. I hope the last two courses are much better covered and not just ran over like this this one was."
109,"A perfect and balanced introduction to the subjects, adding theory and practice beautifully."
110,"Like all the courses in this specialization so far, the material has been good. The reason for only 4 stars rather than 5 is the difficulty in getting questions answered in a timely manner. There don't seem to be any active mentors for this class."
111,"excellent material! It would be nice, however, to mention some reading material, books or articles, for those interested in the details and the theories behind the concepts presented in the course. "
112,This was AWESOME!
113,Great course like the others
114,"An interesting topic, presented well by the instructor and reinforced by intermediate-level programming assignments."
115,Another great hit by Emily and Carlos!!! Excellent Course!!!
116,Interesting content but explanations are less clear with respect to the other courses of the ML Specialization
117,"Emily Fox did a great job in explaining tough concepts with simple explanation of the components in the formulas!! It's a little tough to get through the materials though, it's the 4th course in University of Washington's machine learning specialization afterall =) "
118,"This course started off easy, and became challenging in the last 3 weeks. But a lot of details were covered in the slides and also the forum helped deepen my understanding of the material, and I was able to get through the course. I enjoyed the course!"
119,"This is the toughest courses in the specialization so far. But if you manage to complete it, you'll have some really advance skills under your belt. "
120,"Yet another really excellent course in this series - the best online course I have ever taken. I really appreciate the fairly high level on which it is taught, and the speed with which they go through the material - it is not here to entertain or waste time, but to get straight to the point - what can I do, and how do I use open source tools to do it? "
121,"I used to run into a wall at work trying to train models with recursive partitioning or neural nets because of the long time they took to train for high dimensional data. These clustering techniques are an immense help.Awesome course, with a brilliant instructor and brilliant assignments."
122,"Still a very good course. Week 4 was very tough. The general concept can be understood from a 10,000 feet altitude but the lesson and programming assignment need to be reviewed, maybe with a slower step by step example.As some other student mentioned, it was... brutal.Other than that looking forward to the next course in the specialization!"
123,"The things I liked:-The professor seems very knowledgeable about all the subjects and she also can convey them in a very understandable way (kudos to her since talking to a camera is not easy)-The course was well organized and the deadlines were adjusted when a technical difficulty was found by several students-All the assignments are easy to follow and very detailed -The testing code provided for the programming assignments is a huge help to make sure we are solving it the right wayWhat can be improved:-Some of the concepts during weeks 4 and 5 seemed a bit rushed. Although the professor explained that some details were outside of the scope of this course, I felt that I needed a more thorough explanation in order to understand better-Some links to the documentation of libraries used in the programming assignments were lacking information on how to really use them, I wish we had some other link to worked examples too In general I can say this was another good course for this series. Making a course like this is not easy at all and I can see that they are putting a lot of effort to produce them. All of their hard work is really appreciated on my end."
124,I did not understand LDA from the course materials.
125,"The course, and indeed the whole specialization, was advertised as not requiring the Graphlab Create toolkit. This is untrue, as the final programming assignment does require it. The general dependence on SFrame is understandable since it is open source, but requiring any interaction with a licensed product (even if temporary and research licenses are available) greatly negatively impacted my experience in this course. "
126,Very good course. Too long interval between modules make hard for non-Python developers. Easy to forget some of the Python structures.
127,Superb course!
128,very nice lecture
129,Excellent course. Nice selection of algorithms reviewed - all clearly explained with sample implementations.
130,less complex exercises to check and validate
131,very good course but the last few topics could be improved with better assignments that could be broken down into smaller sub assignments
132,very good course
133,Amazing.
134,This is the best course in ML - would recommend it ...the sequence of the courses is the best...the specialization in this ML is a career boost
135,"Great course. Well packed, well explained, nice practical examples, good all around MOOC with of info."
136,"great course, but module 4 lacks a bit in structure. hard to follow. without the forum, it would not be possible to make it in time. "
137,"Exceptional course! This is challenging material for me, but it's presented in such a coherent manner that you can't help but absorb it."
138,Sets a new benchmark for the specialization !!! A great offering on Machine Learning :)
139,This course rushed through the material at the end. 
140,Very good course nice practical approach. I was kind of surprised that hierarchical clustering was kept at the end and discussed only marginally since it is a widely used approach.I liked the part about LDA but IMHO I would have liked more discussion about fundamental techniques rather than such an advanced method.Too focus on text data. Most of the application I worked on have limited textual data.
141,"The specialization has a good quality on average. I started doing this course immediately after it went open. I had a feeling that the quality of the course went down (questions were often unclear and it took time to figure out what is expected as an answer). However, many problems were solved quite fast and teaching stuff is really helpful. I still would like to see more about MapReduce in-depth in this course. I did not have a feeling that it was covered sufficiently (only theory, no hands-on material). In general, hands-on material was great and useful."
142,"Very nice course, and a great grasp on clustering techniques. If I could just suggest something to improve, it would be the section on LDA and Gibbs: it's very high level and it would be really nice to have some more technical insights on those techniques (perhaps with optional sections, as for other topics)."
143,"Good course for KD trees, LSH, Gaussian mixed model and LDA. "
144,"Great course. Some week were tough others too easy, but general a very interesting course."
145,"I found this Course less well prepared than the previous 3 modules. Misleading hints in the assignments, code errors, etc... Also, I found the amount of work required higher, which is not in itself a bad thing, just a bit unexpected."
146,Great! 
147,"Good class, But it would be much better if the quiz is open to those who doesn't pay."
148,"please rework in particular week 5, part 2"
149,Another great introduction. The assignments are notably a little bit harder than the previous courses.
150,"I loved the previous 3 courses and what I saw in this course so far seems pretty interesting. I'm really sad that Coursera decided to block access to assignments for not paying users. I really wanted to continue with the specialization but I already purchased another specialization, so I'm going to have to put this course on hold for a now. "
151,Not for the faint of heart but this course does a really good job of explaining clustering (and retrieval) of images and text. It includes several programming assignments which can be tackled with minimal programming experience if one perseveres.
152,Another great course. Strongly recommend!
153,Good course. Learned a lot from it. Thanks!
154,This course was great! With good code examples and algorithm applications and also intuition!It's a shame that we couldn't finish planned courses due to busy schedules of instructors as I was really looking forward to the capstone project! 
155,Nice course with all the practical stuffs and nice analysis about each topic but practical part of LDA was restricted for GraphLab users only which is a weak fallback and rest everything is fine.
156,Clustering &amp; Retrieval was a lot tougher compared to courses on regression &amp; classification because the match concepts behind this course were too complex. Nevertheless Emily tried to make this course as intuitive as possible
157,awesome course!
158,"sometimes difficult,but import so many useful knowledge"
159,"The materials presented are excellent with well prepared skeleton codes for all ML models.

160,I liked the slides.
161,very good! strongly recommend to people who want to start a career on data science or are interested in it
162,The teachers are really amazing. They do not just explain it as if they read a book. They explain the concepts very well
163,Overall is great. The LDA and Dendrograms lack quality/specificity and depth of the previous topics. So sad the Specialization collapsed at 4 courses instead of 6.
164,This course was my first encounter with Machine Learning! The course gave me a good understanding of the different ML algorithms used in clustering and retrieval of data! 
165,Very nice course. Concepts are covered very clearly.
166,"For me, this was the toughest of the first four courses in this specialization (now that the last two are cancelled, these are the only four courses in the specialization). I'm satisfied with what I gained in the process of completing these four courses.

167," Really a good course, succinct and concise. "
168,"Great course on machine learning, however, left us in middle of learning, Recommender System + Deep Learning Capstone is missing"
169,Some themes are shown very superficially it would be great to go deeper. Despite of this the course is great! Thanks.
170,The course was very engaging and mathematically intensive. It provides background for all the necessary tools one must know to start clustering. Great Course. Will miss this course format as 5 and 6 are cancelled! 
171,Should use pandas instead of Graph Lab Create
172,Good and deep dive into ML!Absolutely disappointed that the course was delayed and the promise to take it through Course 5 and Capstone Project didn't come through.Not at all happy with that!! 
173,"A great course as the other 3 courses in the specialization.This course introduces and make us implement Knn,Kd trees,Gaussian Mixture model and LDA model for clustering and retrieval.The data set is the peoples wiki from the Foundations course and theres a assignment on clustering images too.If you have taken the other 3 an do this with ease and if you haven't taken those i think it will be better to take this course after the other 3."
174,Excellent course! Thanks a lot for the effort in compiling this course... I really enjoyed it!
175,"Dependence on GraphLab technology is a big minus. The lectures are poorly balanced in terms of difficulty. Apart from that - interesting course, I'm glad I took it."
176, Not happy about course 5 &amp; 6 got cancelled. 
177,"The material is complex and challenging, but the teaching procedure is carefully thought out in a way that you quickly get it, giving you a great sense of accomplishment."
178, Excellent Course!!! 
179,"Very sophisticated, friendly and practical instructions"
180,Enjoyed the course and learned a lot. Amazing! 
181,awesome clustering course
182, This specialization is delayed for months now - very annoying! Don't give them money! 
183,Great course but hard going at times for those of us without a strong maths background. The assignments took me a long time to complete and I think I'll have to revisit some areas as I become more familiar with them to really get the full benefit.
184,"I am taking all courses in the specialization, and this is my fourth. I have been having a great time with materials by both instructors so far, until I came to week 5 of this course.Despite repeated viewing, my understanding of LDA is non-existent. The first section is fine, but starting from Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling, for me at least, the method of instruction has gone off a cliff.I strongly suggest soliciting feedback from learners that narrowly targets the material of this week 5 to determine if it's just me or if this is a wider problem. If it is the latter, perhaps it is time to redesign the lessons of this week."
185,great.
186,VERY IMPRESSIVE COURSE
187,This course contain many advance topic which was covered in fast pace by the professor special end lectures. This course contain very important topics of Machine learning could have given more time in explaining things. Thanks professor 
188," I have enrolled myself in the other Machine Learning courses offered by Uwash , but have to say this was not properly organized. I had got my certificates for the other courses easily , not because the contents was easy , but was easily understandable and well organized and there was a great sense of satisfaction after getting the certificate because of the knowledge gained.But unfortunately for this course , especially the week 4 and week 5 was lengthy and not up to the point and the quizzes were hence not seem to be related. So got my certificate after a bit of struggle. I'm planning to see other online materials related to week 4 and week 5 , as couldn't completely understand from this one. If you can modify those two weeks, it would be great. I hope you continue the great work of illuminating millions of young people's interests through your great courses and organization. Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
189,Excellent course 
190,It is explained in simple and lucid language by expert Emily and codes illustrated by Carlos. Go for it.
191,It's an amazing Course.
192,So Much Concepts to learn and totally worth it!
193,"Comme les pr??c??dents dans de cette sp??cialisation, ce cours est tr??s riche et donne les cl??s pour utiliser des outils complexes et puissants. Toutefois, un peu plus de d??tails sur certains aspects, notamment th??oriques, pourraient am??liorer la compr??hension de certains chapitres plus techniques."
194,"This was probably the most challenging course of them all, I thoroughly enjoyed it! Looking forward to dimensionality reduction and the capstone. "
195,"Thank you, it was a good one"
196,Great course! Very simple and practical.
197,"The course dived into basic and advanced concepts of unsupervised learning. As before, Prof Fox did a great job at explaining things."
198,this is not a an easy course but certainly an awesome one 
199,Excellent! Very good material and lectures and hands on. Really enriching.
200,"Very good, not only learn many good ML concepts, but also polish my python programming skill a lot. Thank you, Emily and Carlos."
201,"Great course, very hands-on, very practical knowledge."
202,Best course available till date as MooC
203,This was another great course. I hope that the instructors indulge in a little bit more theory. Anyway it was a magnificent course. Hope the coming courses are as good as this one.
204,Deep insight into most useful techniques of machine learning.
205,great!
206,Very Good in depth explanation and hand-on lab machine learning course. very focused on real world analytics and algorithms
207,I loved this course. then content is designed to acquire strong foundations in clustering.
208,"I really learn a lot in this course, although the materials are very difficult at first read, but Emily's explanation were clear and I would be able to get the idea after a few review."
209,Great intro!
210,From LDA onwards the pace ramped up ! Please be slow during advance topics. But altogether it was a great course.
211,ok
212,Excellent course - and of great practical use.
213,"All the courses in this specialization are great, but compared to the other 3 i did until now, this one seemed a bit short on material. Especially week 1, and somewhat week 6 was without good material. Weeks 2, 3 and 4 were great. I got lost somewhere in week 5 on collapsed Gibbs sampling.Still: very much recommend this course, it provides a good introduction to Nearest Neighors, K-Means, Gaussian Mixtures and LDA. Thx prof. Fox!!"
214,"For me, this course was disappointing. Here is why: First, the level, at which the course material is presented, is very low. It might be freshman level, but certainly not more. There are many buzzwords but no real explanations. The programming assignments are only doable because most of the work has been done by the people designing the assignments. There is very little left for the students. Furthermore, the procedures, that are already given, are not very well documented. Hence, a lot of guess work is required to figure out how things should work. Furthermore, little effort has been spent to structure the procedures that are already given. Altogether, this makes doing the programming assignments very unsatisfying.Finally, the professor presenting the materials does not take part in the discussion forums. Contrary to other courses that I have attended at Coursera, this time the discussion forum was no help at all."
215,The material covered in this course is immense and gives a deep understanding of several algorithms required to perform unsupervised learning tasks. 
216,"This course was awesome as all the previous courses, I'm waiting to the next course and the capstone"
217,Detailed coverage of several approaches to clustering. Not easy but learned a lot.
218,Awesome :)
219,"Feels like this course in the specialization was a bit rushed, compared to the first 3 courses. It had 2 modules (first &amp; last) that were more like placeholders and the middle 4 modules went from concept to the maths behind the algorithm very quickly. It needs a bit of work on expanding the course and presenting a bit more slowly. Having said all that, the concepts and algorithms taught are very interesting and a good first step into the unsupervised learning section."
220,One of the best machine learning course I have taken.
221,"Another super course. Though admittedly (for me at least) very difficult to make within the allotted time given for one period of the Course. Lots of advanced stuff that require substantial studies to really comprehend, i.e., it should never be enough just to hack &amp; run the code (that's the easier challenge). Still have a long washing list of topics coming out of this Course that I need (want) to understand better. But at least the background to do so is neatly provided here. So without further ado ... Applause!"
222,Excellent course. 
223,"Some of the interesting topics discussed in this course could be treated substantially more extensive and detailed in order to get a better grip and understanding on them (e.g. Gibbs sampling). After this course, it is a bit dazzling how much different algorithms and methods are available for clustering and retrieval tasks and this course easily could have been subdivided into two or three separate courses on the same topic with a more detailed treatment. Still, about many interesting subjects a tip of the iceberg has been brought to you ... it tastes so good that you would like to have much more!"
224,"Amazing course, really helpful, as a ML researcher you need this kind of foundation"
225,"The best course in the specialization thus far. Very rich and wide ranging, perfect for the motivated part-time learner who wants to be challenged and have ample reason to revisit the material. I only wish this course had been longer, perhaps shortening the classification course to make room."
226,a practical and interesting course about clustering and retrival
227,"The assignments are excellent and help understand the algorithms and concepts taught in the course. There are some garbling in the subtitles/transcripts (including the quirky one that every time the lecturer says EM - the EM doesn't appear, and the following word is capitalized). As usual Graphlab Create / Sframes can't handle apply(). however mostly apply() appears in the part of the assignment that inputs files and turns them into data matrices and the explanations how to run the assignment with Scikit-Learn include pre-computed input files"
228,"As someone very keen on math, more math background as optimal video would be more helpful. "
229,"Great course and awesome teaching by Prof. Emily Fox. Prof. Fox did a great job of teaching some of the really tough components (GMM, LDA, etc) in simple and lucid style (like always) and that made it easy to understand and comprehend those topics.The one thing that I felt had gone down compared to the previous 3 courses was that for some of the topics, the material felt too short and felt like it was cut down to fit within the 6 weeks course duration. I would have at least liked some extra reading material or references especially for GMMs, LDA, Gibbs Sampling, etc."
230,Excellent course! Subjects are explained very well! Excellent quizzes that allow understanding of lectures better and excellent (challenging ) programming assignments.
231,Good course!
232,Great! thanks
233,Best Course.
234,Excellent course
235,Very good course!
236,"Overall a good and useful course, however: A) They could do a much better job regarding LDA, standard Gibbs sampling, and Bayesian model and inference. Many slides on these 3 topics only contained some text and the instructor tried to verbally visualize the related important concepts. Hence not a good use of a video session. B) Week 1 and the 1st half of Week 6 were redundant.C) It would be much better to have a 7-week course with more topics and may be with some optional videos on Bayesian model, HMM."
237,"Good survey of the material, but assignments are superficial and don't test thorough understanding."
238,Worth the wait. COOL learning
239,Best course I've taken!! :)
240,Simply Amazing!
241,"Following the overall quality of this Specialization, this course was excellent. From the content, to the assesments, material and teachers. This course is a really good starting point to become an expert in Machine Learning techniques."
242,Awesome course! The session on EM algorithm is revealing!
243,A little too superficial and hand waving.
244,"The last weeks, we went through the material a little bit too fast."
245,the homework is getting easy
246,strongly recommended!
247,"The retrieval part of this course is great, it deserve five starts. The clustering part was going well until it reached LDA. The LDA module is very poorly covered, and also very hard to understand. I had to watch the videos more than two times to try to figure out what was LDA, and a Quora article posted in the Forum could explain it much better.Then we get to the Hierarchical Clustering module, which was the most poorly module in all this specialization. There is only one video talking about HMM models, and Markov Chains deserve at least one week to even get started with it. And to complete, there is just one Assignment with only 3 questions.The specialization was going perfect until now. I am very disappointed with this course. I hope the last two courses are much better covered and not just ran over like this this one was."
248,"A perfect and balanced introduction to the subjects, adding theory and practice beautifully."
249,"Like all the courses in this specialization so far, the material has been good. The reason for only 4 stars rather than 5 is the difficulty in getting questions answered in a timely manner. There don't seem to be any active mentors for this class."
250,"excellent material! It would be nice, however, to mention some reading material, books or articles, for those interested in the details and the theories behind the concepts presented in the course. "
251,This was AWESOME!
252,Great course like the others
253,Another great hit by Emily and Carlos!!! Excellent Course!!!
254,Interesting content but explanations are less clear with respect to the other courses of the ML Specialization
255,"This course started off easy, and became challenging in the last 3 weeks. But a lot of details were covered in the slides and also the forum helped deepen my understanding of the material, and I was able to get through the course. I enjoyed the course!"
256,"This is the toughest courses in the specialization so far. But if you manage to complete it, you'll have some really advance skills under your belt. "
257,"Yet another really excellent course in this series - the best online course I have ever taken. I really appreciate the fairly high level on which it is taught, and the speed with which they go through the material - it is not here to entertain or waste time, but to get straight to the point - what can I do, and how do I use open source tools to do it? "
258,"I used to run into a wall at work trying to train models with recursive partitioning or neural nets because of the long time they took to train for high dimensional data. These clustering techniques are an immense help.Awesome course, with a brilliant instructor and brilliant assignments."
259,"The things I liked:-The professor seems very knowledgeable about all the subjects and she also can convey them in a very understandable way (kudos to her since talking to a camera is not easy)-The course was well organized and the deadlines were adjusted when a technical difficulty was found by several students-All the assignments are easy to follow and very detailed -The testing code provided for the programming assignments is a huge help to make sure we are solving it the right wayWhat can be improved:-Some of the concepts during weeks 4 and 5 seemed a bit rushed. Although the professor explained that some details were outside of the scope of this course, I felt that I needed a more thorough explanation in order to understand better-Some links to the documentation of libraries used in the programming assignments were lacking information on how to really use them, I wish we had some other link to worked examples too In general I can say this was another good course for this series. Making a course like this is not easy at all and I can see that they are putting a lot of effort to produce them. All of their hard work is really appreciated on my end."
260,I did not understand LDA from the course materials.
261,Very good course. Too long interval between modules make hard for non-Python developers. Easy to forget some of the Python structures.
262,Superb course!
263,Excellent course. Nice selection of algorithms reviewed - all clearly explained with sample implementations.
264,less complex exercises to check and validate
265,very good course but the last few topics could be improved with better assignments that could be broken down into smaller sub assignments
266,very good course
267,"Great course. Well packed, well explained, nice practical examples, good all around MOOC with of info."
268,"Exceptional course! This is challenging material for me, but it's presented in such a coherent manner that you can't help but absorb it."
269,Sets a new benchmark for the specialization !!! A great offering on Machine Learning :)
270,This course rushed through the material at the end. 
271,Very good course nice practical approach. I was kind of surprised that hierarchical clustering was kept at the end and discussed only marginally since it is a widely used approach.I liked the part about LDA but IMHO I would have liked more discussion about fundamental techniques rather than such an advanced method.Too focus on text data. Most of the application I worked on have limited textual data.
272,"The specialization has a good quality on average. I started doing this course immediately after it went open. I had a feeling that the quality of the course went down (questions were often unclear and it took time to figure out what is expected as an answer). However, many problems were solved quite fast and teaching stuff is really helpful. I still would like to see more about MapReduce in-depth in this course. I did not have a feeling that it was covered sufficiently (only theory, no hands-on material). In general, hands-on material was great and useful."
273,"Good course for KD trees, LSH, Gaussian mixed model and LDA. "
274,"Great course. Some week were tough others too easy, but general a very interesting course."
275,Great! 
276,Another great introduction. The assignments are notably a little bit harder than the previous courses.
277,Not for the faint of heart but this course does a really good job of explaining clustering (and retrieval) of images and text. It includes several programming assignments which can be tackled with minimal programming experience if one perseveres.
278,Excellet! I highly recommend!
279,Very good. I enjoyed doing it and learned a lot. I would have liked that it had included r as one of the softwares. 
280,easy to capture the concept
281,"Excellent introductory course on machine learning focusing on simple linear and multiple regression, lasso regression and k-means clustering. A background in Python programming is useful but not required as the instructors discuss the techniques with annotated code examples."
282,Course could be better
283,"Personally felt this course have a lot more potential. The explanations in the lectures felt very robotic especially when describing the scripts. At times the lectures slides felt like displaying the subtitles and reading off them. A lot more diagrams could have been illustrated for explanations. I have to watch other videos in youtube to get a better grasp of the concepts.Good thing is that this is an introductory course, and the codes are given."
284,"Excellent course, some basic tecniques of Machine Learning are implemented in Python and SAS."
285,Great Class!
286,Very good course. I recommend to anyone who's interested in data analysis and machine learning.
287,short vedios and good ma
288,"Not good at all.We see different processes without anyone making clear the reason why we should apply this processes ,under which conditions and what is the question that we have to answer when we apply these processes.The only good is that we get into some new terms and see new things.I could say that for me,it wouldn't make such a difference if it wasn't in this specialization."
289,"It is very interesting, helpful, useful and wonderful course. Everybody who interesting in statistic must surely learn this course."
290, V 
291,Option of learning both SAS and Python is great!
292,Good introduction with python example for famous algorithm such as random forest and k-mean
293,"Actually i want rate 0, as the instruction for the installation of new tools are quite vague and misleading"
294,This level of detail was good for easier statistical concepts but there are much better courses on Coursera for Machine Learning
295,It's not an intro class. But you can practice a lot if you know something. 
296, Noiiice! 
297,"Disadvantages : Lacks Rigour, Lacks Support from instructors , Expensive , Peer review ( this is somewhat bad as most barely give any comments, though towards the end, reviews tend to be pretty good). *** DISCLAIMER *** I am not statistically significant as i only receive 3 reviews per week. Advantages :Quick to earn cert, prewritten code available for easy use. Assignments on your own data. This is probably useful for people wanting to learn techniques for data analysis, who need not go too deep into the technique. I would recommend this to people learning techniques for data analysis in various non-mathematical and non-statistical fields, though the content lacks rigour, and you need outside sources to help understand techniques. This course IS NOT WORTH PAYING USD79, there are definitely other courses much more worth the money. You can audit it for free, if you do not want a cert. "
298,More examples in coding and results are expected. So it is more convenient for students to compare different results and understand deeper
299,I would like to have an opportunity to contact my reviews.
300,Not impressed with the teaching style.Seems that lectures were being read and not taught.
301,Not deep enough on diagnostic and interpretation
302,"It was okay for an introduction to the methods, but I would have liked to learn about them in more details, i.e. the course was too short."
303,Excellent course
304,"I really liked this course. Concepts well explained. I was hoping for more practical exercises on different types of data sets along with how to improve model accuracy in various algorithm taught. concept such as pruning etc. were missing. But I am sure in future, we will have more on it. Thanks Professor."
305,Excellet! I highly recommend!
306,Very good. I enjoyed doing it and learned a lot. I would have liked that it had included r as one of the softwares.

321,Excellent course
322,Fantastic course! I would recommend to anyone interested in learning the graph data structure in a fun and hands-on and engaging way! Definitely one of the best courses I have followed on Coursera.
323,"Although it is a little bit hard for beginner, it's really useful !! I am so happy that I have learned a lot about graph since there are many difficulties in this course."
324,Pretty challenging but very interesting with a lot of useful assignments. Certainly good for those who aren't familiar with a data structure called graphs.
325,One of the coolest courses I took on Coursera!
326,"Excellent course, appreciated the peer review aspect."
327,Very well structured course.
328,Excellent job! Learning various search algorithms with diverse applications in real life.
329,A great and 'must-do' course for all beginners.
330,Great 
331,Good introduction to Data Structures with Java examples
332,"I thought the course was an outstanding treatment of data structures and algorithms. The instructors advance to more complex structures and algorithms as the student progresses. I never felt overwhelmed at any stage, and by the end of the course, I was impressed with how much new material we had covered."
333,Very good course. I wish we could have done more algorithms with the map. Such a great way to teach algorithms. 
334,Great learning!
335,"It was really great course ,well designed and challenging ."
336,Course teams really spend a lot of time for providing a great studying experience and procedure.
337,"UCSD always bring there A game, with fun projects and extensions to real world problems. I have completed all three courses.This course was especially informative as it dipped into the graph theory and the optimization problems we face. The course itself is fun and informative and may seem tough at times but is really rewarding once complete. Thanks guys and girls."
338,"Great faculty, great course, great practical project!"
339,"Great Instructors...Thank you Instructors,google engineers, coursera and UCSD."
340,Really helpful the course was.
341,nice course. very well organised and presented. good refresher of ADS in Java
342,"The projects are fun, but the course is too short and abbreviated."
343,Greate course! It was really fun and really difficult for me.
344,So So.Not good to learn an algorithm
345,Really fun
346,"Another course handled excellently in the series. All the lectures and topics were really effective in introducing weighty concepts, but making it much easier to work with them through clear explanations. Super knowledgeable instructers, assignments and quizzes helped contribute to some solid learning through the course. The course was put together really well, thanks!"
347,"Overall, I enjoyed this course. Especially from week 1 to 3 where the course contents were simply amazing.It would be great if week 4 and 5 can engage the students like week 1 to 3, and the forum can be more alive.Thank you."
348,Helpful! 
349,Excellent material and instructors
350,"This is a really useful course. The project is quite relevant, and the work with breadth first search, Dijkstra, and A* Search are really interesting!"
351,Challenging class and well-designed course for intermediate Java programmers.
352,Excellent course!
353,Very well structured
354,This course was excellent! I learned so much and I am now able to understand the significance of knowing how Algorithms and Data Structures are related in a practical way. I
355,Very well designed class by 3 great professors!
356,The last 2 lessons did not have much content. Particularly there was no practical assessment on traveling salesman
357,Nice course!
358,Fantastic Course
359,"It would be very, very beneficial if maybe one or two more videos were added to dive in-depth into ADTs and their method callback run-time analysis. Aside from that this class was educational and interesting as expected."
360,"Super awesome course, love the professors, would've been even better if covered hashing in more detail."
361,I think it would be better if the lectures can go a little bit deeper on the topics in this course.
362,Very nice course for clearing the concept of the advanced search algorithm and applying them in the real world scenario. Well designed course and programming materials. 
363,Wonderful Course. This has very good explanation of Data Structures
364,great course :)
365,"its hard, but intresting"
366, Nicely explained and challenging projects. 
367, Very interesting and adaptative for the student as you can catch another later session.I found there's a huge gap between week1 and week2.Thanks 
368, Good course! 
369,"Good course. The example application is fun (looking at graph data structures as part of route planning in a Google Maps based app) - and there is room to experiment. I continue to enjoy the instructors, who present well and have obviously done a good job preparing the material. Much fun!"
370,"The first 3 weeks are really good, 5 stars. Weeks 4 and 5 are way too light. Week 4 has no programming assignment and a short class and 5 has a weak programming assignment and no class. "
371,Now i understand how gps planing routes work! I really like Data Structures and the importance of Graphs
372,"Loved it. Once again the skeleton code provided and course material was great. It was once again introducing new concepts which were never part of BASIC, FORTRAN or DELPHI. So I enjoyed the pain of having to get my head around the objects and code.Thanks !!!!"
373,I understood about graphs from here at last after trying various resources online but peace was attained here in this course
374,Really nice finish to the specialization.
375,I give really high marks for this course as the graphs are presented in a proper and practical manner. I have a suggestion to present the High Level of Graphs more in the area of Information theory. Otherwise it is nice approach and very good implementation of the material and exams.
376,"awesome course , gave me lot of confidence thanks a lot "
377,excellent course. wonderful explanation
378,"The course content and presentation was excellent. I love the large-project format of the classes in this specialization. I only wish this course had more resources for working offline, at a level that matches the previous courses in the specialization. "
379,good job however I think it was quite short and quite shallow
380,This is an awesome course with great stuff for learning and practical graphs concept in programming with some useful algorithms like A*. 
381,Great course!
382,Excelent
383,By far the best course I have ever found about Data Structures in Java.
384,"I am really enjoying this course, thanks for all your efforts!"
385,Introduction to data structures. It wastes a week talking about theoretical complexity when it could have been used for something more productive.
386,"This course is very helpful in understanding Graph, which was a pain in other courses"
387,A lot of work has been put into this course. You will get to learn a lot and use a lot of Java collections framework. You will also get to use concepts of Polymorphism and Inheritance if you are not already familiar with it.
388,Exciting algorithm application in path-finding and routing.
389,Best classes I ever took till now. This really enhanced my Java programming skills. Thank you.
390,Thanks for sharing the knowledge.this course was awesome
391,Excellent course. All the concepts are very well explained and the assignments are enjoyable and worthwhile. Highly recommended.
392,I have really enjoyed this!
393,Dijkstra and A star algorithms courses are a bit short 
394,Very interesting and challenging
395,"The contents were pretty basic for me, but they were presented clearly. All in all I liked the review this course gave me."
396,Very good series for learning Java and OO Principles. The big application approach is very interesting as we can see the whole picture even when we know little yet. The interviews with software engineers are very enlightening.This particular installment has the animation of the shortest path algorithm on the map and that's very helpful to fully understand the amount of work and the effects of optimizations in different shortest path approaches.
397,"For me, it is easier to grasp algorithms that are written out than audio/video description. I would have given 5 stars if the course material accommodated different learning styles for each chapter. I had to do a fair amount of searching for information on the A Star search algorithm to the understand the subtle details."
398,"It's good to start an algorithm of graph implementation. Except the first Assignment, the next following assignments are a little bit tough for me. "
399,Amazing course with amazing teachers .Worth every penny .
400,Very nice course which gives good introduction to data structures. I love it. :)
401,Loved it . Best MOOC specialization I have attended. Thanks a lot!!!
402,great course thanks!
403,"The course is well-laid and very interesting. Even though the material is pretty difficult and advanced. As always the great talent of Christine, Mia and Leo is beyond praise. I definitely recommend this course for developers who want to improve their mastery. Many thanks for the brilliant course."
404,well structured! I learnt a lot.
405,"What I really enjoyed in this course was to discover how to represent streets and intersections and finally trace a path from a starting point to a destination, like a GPS! Really nice!"
406,As all their courses this one is great!
407,Awesome course!
408,Graphs now are more interesting and useful!
409,Excellent specialization
410,Teach you the basic of graph
411,Nice course.
412,Thanks a lot! Very interesting course!
413,An exceptional course in intermediary programming!
414,Nice one!!
415,"I really like the way that the professors explain everything. I also like the project which helps me understand and memorize the algorithms by fitting them into real world problem, that I learned Dijkstra algorithm multiple times but this is the first time I feel like understanding it thoroughly and will keep it in my mind."
416,"At first the course is hands on, later on it becomes more of theory. This would have been a challenging course if we had more harder graph problems to solve though."
417,"The content is just amazing, and the teachers are so awesome prompted me to do more courses from UCSD"
418,Amazing beginner course to learn about the Graph data structure.
419,The content of the course is great. By having the concept challenges and real world tie-ins the professors ensure you've absorbed the concepts. 
420,"Great courser, challenging assignment, but learnt a lot"
421,In Depth Course..
422,Nice concrete course to take. Good info about graphs as a whole. Enjoyed it. :)
423,Good use of data structures.
424,Great course.
425,"The course is really way to easy. It could be done all in one day, definitely not worth 80$. "
426,"Challenging and fun. So glad I took this course. Made some cool changes for the extension, but I'll keep working on it just for fun!"
427,good course on Graph 
428,Very useful :)
429,Course was well paced. Assignments were relevant. Only shortcoming I believe was that the last two weeks of the course did not require any submission of a coding assignment. Only required a quiz. I feel that the course would benefit from a requirement to submit some code each week.
430,I recommend it. It 'a complete course and allows you to explore the use of data structures with Java.
431,Its awesome one
432,"Very informative and learning experience. This is first time I have attended any online course. This course and coaches in the course explained things so nicely that I felt it like sitting in a class room. Entire team deserves a BIG applaud for conducting such a nice session. Course content was nicely designed and brilliantly explained. Its really worth appearing in this course. Thank you UC, San Diego !!!"
433,"Easy to Understand. Beautiful Course. Interesting Assignments and Quiz. Will help in my Career. Good Job by Google Engineers ,Coursera Team and the University."
434,Amazing course. I have learned a lot 
435,This was a very useful course which covered the main fundamental aspects of graphs in Java. The assignments were very interesting and challenging as well. The lecture videos provided all the information in a very detailed manner. There was nothing more I could ask for. Overall it was a great experience!!
436,"I'm graduated in System Analysis, not Computer Sciences, and learned to program only by experience. After 20 years it's a good deal but still I missed the theoretical background and this always annoyed me. I knew and used to make good use of all the structures presented in this course but never could quite explain how or why, or talk in asymptotic notations. Now I can. I didn't stop here, I do take some topics to deep dive during the lectures. It's being a great experience and I only wish I could have more time to keep myself always enrolled in some course."
437,"As 2 previous courses of this specialization - the authors did a great job! I really enjoy it and learn a lot of things. The workload is perfect: not too much, so you can get things done on time, but still pretty informative and intense. The way the material is presented is beyond all expectations. I really recommend this specialization to anybody looking for a good course of algorithms in Java. "
438,Really coool
439,Excellent! Very ambitious and well calibrated course. That can really be used for real applications.
440,"Interesting things about graph algos, but I think the content should be more challengingEspecially the last two weeks, a quick quizz and a free assignment the automatically give full grade whatever the content"
441,Thank you. Very interesting course.
442,interesting project.
443,Great course. Detailed content on the graph data structure.
444,"Good course to build confidence in building a class from scratch. But, I expected more from this course. A few lectures could have been devoted to popular design patterns used in Graph problems maybe.One more assignment to actually make the students work on heuristics for solving NP-Hard problems would have been helpful."
445,"learning graph with Java while reviewing varieties of java advanced data structure. in a word, help me a lot."
446,"Wonderful course, I will never forget the Santa example used to describe the Traveling Sales Man problem. Absolutely love all the instructors."
447,Extremely well planned and interesting.
448,"A few more graph algorithms and their implementations, if added to the course, would be nice."
449,"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about graphs and other advanced data structures. The course is really well planed and has an incredible starter code to work on. I would like to address one thing mentioned in some reviews: since the authors were focused on creating the best possible resources for the main topic of the course (and they did it remarkably well), some other data structures used in graphs (such as HashSet and PriorityQueues) seemed poorly covered, and hence it seemed there is a lack of resources for the course. But in my opinion, this was not a big issue, anyone interested could have found a bunch of free online resources. It is unrealistic to expect that the course should cover all the accompanying topics, they are just too broad. The course covers exactly what is described in its description. The only remark I have is the lack of programming assignments in the fourth week. But I am sure this can and will be easily fixed in some of the future course offerings. To conclude, based only on the knowledge I had before the course, and the knowledge I have now, this course deserves nothing less than a 5-star rating."
450,"This course was very well put together. The videos were clear and well organized. They typically contained a powerpoint presentation and little box with the presenter's head. The assignments built off of each other by reusing code from previous weeks. The test cases for the grader weren't very complete. If I have any recommendations for the organizers it would be to tighten up their grading process. (For one assignment, I completely forgot to write one function and there was no test coverage for it! I ended up writing it the next week.) Still the codebase that they have provided for the class is large so I don't fault them for bugs. I think it will probably improve over time as more people take the course. Overall, they did a great job!"
451,Good
452,Learn graph data structures through the creation of a very cool project. Awesome class!
453,Splendidly covers path finding basics. Enjoyed the course.It would be great to go into advanced algorithms useful for programming challenges (like SPOJ) with the same instructors.
454,Amazing!
455,Really excited for this class!
456,"There is not enough background information, no reading assignments. This makes the course less understandable. Also, the examples given not related to the stated assignment"
457,Excellent teaching !
458,"Excellent course, if a little short. the instructors did a really good job of explaining the concepts."
459,Very good. Would have been even better if the course was a little more broad and more algorithms were covered.
460,I learn a lot of new algorithm in graph theory and i given opportunity to apply it in a project. One of the best course in algorithm.
461,This is a great course with advanced content and real world projects.
462,A great course as the previous courses for the specialization. I know that the week 4's materials are out of this specialization's scope but I think it's alright to delve in more about P and NP problems. That material is somehow still incomprehensible for me.
463,"Compared to the previous 2 courses, this one seemed to have been made in rush. Not enough materials covered, nor enough Java practice opportunity. The course title is misleading because it does not cover any other data structures but graph."
464,Just the course I was hoping for!
465,Great Courses just loving it
466,"Great course, very informative and fun."
467,Felt like it was a bit rushed and some of these concepts like Dijkstra definitely deserve a lot more attention.
468,Very good introduction to advanced data structures in Java. This course is well designed and organized according to the cognitive psychology. Thanks! 
469,"Very interesting programming assignment for the BFS, Dijkstra and A* methods. Great job with that.The coverage of the TSP was weak -- room for improvement there. Perhaps include a programming assignment.Overall, the course was a worthwhile investment of time."
470,The course is really amazing. Professors are great.
471,Best and complete course series in course era. The best course staff of any course I have taken. The best quality of instruction and knowledge gained.Thanks to all team worked in this specialization
472,Simply amazing!
473,"Great instructors, videos and activities. The projects are really enjoyable to enroll."
474,"This is one of the best series of courses I came along in online MOOC platform, such a brilliant course, this whole specialization is brilliant, such a interesting projects, I'm disappointed that I live in country that isn't that much wealthy to help this Specialization and to be able to do Capstone Project , but I wish all the best hope to finish all in time, this is in my top 3 online MOOC Courses and I saw a lot of them.I wish all the best to this team and people that made this possible."
475,best course ever seen
476,Fantastic course! I would recommend to anyone interested in learning the graph data structure in a fun and hands-on and engaging way! Definitely one of the best courses I have followed on Coursera.
477,"Although it is a little bit hard for beginner, it's really useful !! I am so happy that I have learned a lot about graph since there are many difficulties in this course."
478,Pretty challenging but very interesting with a lot of useful assignments. Certainly good for those who aren't familiar with a data structure called graphs.
479,One of the coolest courses I took on Coursera!
480,"Excellent course, appreciated the peer review aspect."
481,Excellent job! Learning various search algorithms with diverse applications in real life.
482,A great and 'must-do' course for all beginners.
483,Great 
484,Good introduction to Data Structures with Java examples
485,"I thought the course was an outstanding treatment of data structures and algorithms. The instructors advance to more complex structures and algorithms as the student progresses. I never felt overwhelmed at any stage, and by the end of the course, I was impressed with how much new material we had covered."
486,Great learning!
487,"It was really great course ,well designed and challenging ."
488,"UCSD always bring there A game, with fun projects and extensions to real world problems. I have completed all three courses.This course was especially informative as it dipped into the graph theory and the optimization problems we face. The course itself is fun and informative and may seem tough at times but is really rewarding once complete. Thanks guys and girls."
489,"Great Instructors...Thank you Instructors,google engineers, coursera and UCSD."
490,nice course. very well organised and presented. good refresher of ADS in Java
491,"The projects are fun, but the course is too short and abbreviated."
492,Greate course! It was really fun and really difficult for me.
493,"Another course handled excellently in the series. All the lectures and topics were really effective in introducing weighty concepts, but making it much easier to work with them through clear explanations. Super knowledgeable instructers, assignments and quizzes helped contribute to some solid learning through the course. The course was put together really well, thanks!"
494,"Overall, I enjoyed this course. Especially from week 1 to 3 where the course contents were simply amazing.It would be great if week 4 and 5 can engage the students like week 1 to 3, and the forum can be more alive.Thank you."
495,"This is a really useful course. The project is quite relevant, and the work with breadth first search, Dijkstra, and A* Search are really interesting!"
496,Challenging class and well-designed course for intermediate Java programmers.
497,Excellent course!
498,This course was excellent! I learned so much and I am now able to understand the significance of knowing how Algorithms and Data Structures are related in a practical way. I
499,The last 2 lessons did not have much content. Particularly there was no practical assessment on traveling salesman
500,Nice course!
501,Fantastic Course
502,"It would be very, very beneficial if maybe one or two more videos were added to dive in-depth into ADTs and their method callback run-time analysis. Aside from that this class was educational and interesting as expected."
503,Very nice course for clearing the concept of the advanced search algorithm and applying them in the real world scenario. Well designed course and programming materials. 
504,Wonderful Course. This has very good explanation of Data Structures
505,great course :)
506,"its hard, but intresting"
507, Nicely explained and challenging projects. 
508, Very interesting and adaptative for the student as you can catch another later session.I found there's a huge gap between week1 and week2.Thanks 
509, Good course! 
510,"Good course. The example application is fun (looking at graph data structures as part of route planning in a Google Maps based app) - and there is room to experiment. I continue to enjoy the instructors, who present well and have obviously done a good job preparing the material. Much fun!"
511,Now i understand how gps planing routes work! I really like Data Structures and the importance of Graphs
512,"Loved it. Once again the skeleton code provided and course material was great. It was once again introducing new concepts which were never part of BASIC, FORTRAN or DELPHI. So I enjoyed the pain of having to get my head around the objects and code.Thanks !!!!"
513,I understood about graphs from here at last after trying various resources online but peace was attained here in this course
514,I give really high marks for this course as the graphs are presented in a proper and practical manner. I have a suggestion to present the High Level of Graphs more in the area of Information theory. Otherwise it is nice approach and very good implementation of the material and exams.
515,"awesome course , gave me lot of confidence thanks a lot "
516,"The course content and presentation was excellent. I love the large-project format of the classes in this specialization. I only wish this course had more resources for working offline, at a level that matches the previous courses in the specialization. "
517,This is an awesome course with great stuff for learning and practical graphs concept in programming with some useful algorithms like A*. 
518,Great course!
519,Introduction to data structures. It wastes a week talking about theoretical complexity when it could have been used for something more productive.
520,Exciting algorithm application in path-finding and routing.
521,Best classes I ever took till now. This really enhanced my Java programming skills. Thank you.
522,Thanks for sharing the knowledge.this course was awesome
523,Excellent course. All the concepts are very well explained and the assignments are enjoyable and worthwhile. Highly recommended.
524,I have really enjoyed this!
525,Very interesting and challenging
526,"The contents were pretty basic for me, but they were presented clearly. All in all I liked the review this course gave me."
527,Very good series for learning Java and OO Principles. The big application approach is very interesting as we can see the whole picture even when we know little yet. The interviews with software engineers are very enlightening.This particular installment has the animation of the shortest path algorithm on the map and that's very helpful to fully understand the amount of work and the effects of optimizations in different shortest path approaches.
528,great course thanks!
529,"The course is well-laid and very interesting. Even though the material is pretty difficult and advanced. As always the great talent of Christine, Mia and Leo is beyond praise. I definitely recommend this course for developers who want to improve their mastery. Many thanks for the brilliant course."
530,well structured! I learnt a lot.
531,"What I really enjoyed in this course was to discover how to represent streets and intersections and finally trace a path from a starting point to a destination, like a GPS! Really nice!"

569,"Thank the teacher, the course is very good, the teacher is also very nice. The first three weeks of feeling learned a lot of new knowledge, the last week may be each class time is relatively long. It would be better if you could split it."
570,"So many mistakes in the slides. Coding exercises are so hard to comprehend, it's tough to know what you are trying to achieve. I have already done a course in spark, this was supposed to be just refresher, but now I'm just confused..."
571,Thanks :)
572,Basics are covered in an effective way.
573,"Very average. Lectures could be a fraction of their current length, too much time spent rephrasing the same point (sometimes 3+ times!). It was driving me nuts, my mind would wonder if I didn't focus. It would be nice to have local tests that incrementally check progress similar to Andrew Ng's Machine Learning coursera."
574,Great course. Would definitely recommend.
575,Good course.
576,Great Course! 
577,Awesome video lectures by the instructor. The content is very good and i fee i gained good knowledge. I really loved the series. 
578,Great! But I want to know more about dataset! 
579,"This is my first cource review on English, but I want to do accent on Heather's high professionalism, great explanations abilities and great organisation of material. I need to say that I have education of computer science teacher and I can say that it's wonderful cource. It was difficult for me and I've really increased my skill. Thanx. "
580,"Nice course, thanks!"
581,"I had previous experience with Scala and Spark and I really enjoyed the course. I learned some very interesting things, specially y de last 2 weeks about partitioning and Spark SQL."
582,Awesome teacher - very engaging. This is probably first time when I am watching lectures with pleasure. Also you can easily feel that course is fresh and specially made for this unlike previous ones from Scala speciality.
583,"It gave me very good understanding on Spark Architecture, functioning along with hands on over Scala. Good examples used during lessons."
584,This course is awesome. I got a pretty good idea of spark. In fact this course helped me understand scala well. 
585,Great lectures and great content!
586,Awesome course !
587,Very good and concise course.
588,I guess it's a goo introduction course into Apache Spark. Meantime I would expect deeper dive into optimizations and algorithms.
589,excellent quality of content
590,"Great subject, well explained with solid weekly assignments make this course a stellar learning experience."
591,Good course. Could be more comprehensive about analysis. Content is all video and Lecture notes would be nice.
592,"Great course, learnt a lot from it. Thank you. "
593,love this topic!!!! New and frontier technology in NLP. More and more concentrations and analysis on this big data research.I wish more courses about Parallel clustering using Spark available to the many.
594,"In the assignments, I had the feeling that the goal was more guess what they want than write it correctly using what you have learnt. Stating more clearly the requirements and improving error messages from the grader may help."
595,"Relatively decent video lectures, if not that blurry which makes text hard to read. Accompanied with awful practice lessons: - code templates are written with little to no style, even file reading is done in 3 different ways in all 3 lessons; - grader output is very confusing and almost useless; - unit tests, very useful to avoid some common caveats, were present in the first lesson, disappear completely in the last one.Probably following spark's programming guide is better time investment, even if it misses some humanity of video lectures "
596,"Amazing lectures, and challenging tasks to do on the way. I really enjoyed going through the course, and I learned a lot."
597,"Great course, good intro into Spark."
598,"good: the concepts and on-hands skills taught by the course are good.bad: the assignments. you cannot complete them just by following the course material, forcing you to waste quite a lot of time either: (1) learning from other sources; (2) looking for answers on the forum; or (3) brute forcing an answer till rage quitting :)another bad point: the course is supposed to be focused on spark &amp; big data analysis but it has 1-2 lectures (around 40-60 mins) pretty much devoted to showing some SQL. &lt;&lt; this could be summarized to around 10-20 mins and/or give a link to quickly learn/try to some other source."
599,Very interesting course!!
600,"Very interesting course about Spark, it covers a lot of key concepts!"
601,Good introduction to Spark. One thing that I didn't like was use of simple Ints and Strings instead of types.
602,"Pretty nice course. But with one comment on the grading system, sometime the comment &amp; message is not that intuitive enough."
603,"Yet another excellent Scala class. Good lectures, good assignments. Clear and understandable, while presenting a whole bunch of new concepts."
604,This course is very well done.
605,Instructor has been explaining the concepts with more practical direction
606,"Taking into consideration that this was the first edition of the course, I can say that it has been a nice journey. I am glad about the fact that Heather managed to expose a bit of the Spark internals and not only talk about querying data and how easily this can be made by using Spark (as most of the Spark oriented courses consist of). In addition to this, I could listen to Heather all day long - she's a great presenter and has wonderful teaching skills. However, the homework has outlined some neglected aspects of the course:- vague description or requirements- not strongly related to the presented content (the lectures outlined partitioning mechanism, but the homework 2 did not require it...)- not so meaningful feedback, except for some tests failing/passing - I would have expected something like you did ok, but your job took longer than expected; check out this and thatOverall, it's been a highly expected course and it was nice to get a broader outlook on Spark. I hope that there will be more courses (and more detailed) related to Spark ecosystem in the near future."
607,"Great course, I learned a lot through the course. However, some of the lectures are quite long and could do with being broken down in to more smaller segments."
608,Great course - well prepared by the team.
609,"Gives a really solid overview of the foundations of the Spark programming model, where it came from, and how latency affects this model for a distributed cluster. Explains well the key differenced between RDDs, Datasets, and Dataframes. Thought the videos were unnecessarily long and could do with sharpening them up a bit."
610,"The selection of content is very good. Yet, the course requires solid amount of polishing. I had a feeling that the real teaching started only in the 4th week, with lots of walking around the subject in the beginning. Worth to mention that in contrast to the first 3 courses in Scala specialisation this one is very heavy on visual aspect. You actually have to see the picture, as the voice channel just references it.I can certainly recommend this course to people curious about data analysis. If you have had some experience and would like to try Spark or get better at it, then probably a good book can save your time. "
611,"Learned Spark APIs, internals."
612,Would be better to have more and shorter exercises.
613,"a let down and not up to par with other courses in the series.Huge amount of time is wasted bsically repeating that the API is close to scala collections'. The huge amout of time is wasted again on very simple dataframe APIs including several slides presenting the show() function. Allow me to repeat : several slides presenting the show() function.Finally the assignments are unimaginative and mechanical. The desciption is really confuse and most of the time is spend trying to chase small differences away to please the grader.The sole part of the course that seemed interesting was the shuffling one, that was unfourtunately ignored on the assignmentsNot related to the course but to spark: What utter mess are dataframes and datasets filled with boilerplate type conversions and runtime erros. I shy away in disgust form this untyped IDE-unfriendly monstruosity. "
614,This course is a great introduction to Spark. The only thing I think could be improved is that each programming assignments has unit tests that drive students towards the final solution. I saw lots of people complaining in the forums about this slow and tedious back and forth of having the grader testing their code.
615,"This is a really excellent course. It deals with difficult content clearly, thoroughly and at a good pace. I would now be happy to use Spark in my work and feel I have a strong base to go on to further study. The exercises are well conceived covering fairly realistic use cases and are of about the right complexity. BUT, the feedback from the automatic grading really lets it down.The auto grading tests are at too high a granularity, each test tests too many things. They give cryptic errors such as '&lt;some random element&gt; is empty'. You have no idea why the element is empty as the students are given a different dataset to the one tested on. Moreover, the failed tests are invariably nothing to do with learnt course content, but trivial rounding/formatting errors. The forums are a lifesaver, but I still spent a good two weekends working on bugs once I'd got the assignments 70% right. I would not recommend to a completist!All the same, thanks to Heather for the wonderful work she's done putting it together and the excellent lectures she gives."
616,Very Very Interesting and helpful!The slides' layout is very clear and step by step for each important topic.The motivation of why we need dataframe and dataset and what's their difference is explained with a logical and reasonable way!
617,I really liked the content regarding Dataframes and Datasets. 
618,It was good. Got indepth knowledge of Spark API
619,"Informative. Although, it a week course on architecture of Spark (especially YARN mode), explaining Spark Jobs, Stages &amp; Tasks would be nice addition. Thank you for sharing knowledge and a wonderful learning experience!"
620,I like the course tempo very much. It kept me away from doing anything else while listening to the lectures.
621,It was well worth the wait! The instructor was good. Assignments were challenging as well as hands on!
622,Amazingly polished and well taught course although being given for the first time
623,"I understand that creating such a course is a tremendous amount of work. Let me congratulation the developers for all their hard work. I learned a lot. I'm glad I good the course, and I'm speechless that I finally finished it with a passing albeit imperfect score. This was the maiden voyage and it has some problems that should probably be corrected. That's my opinion. There were generally two sets of challenges with each assignment exercise (1) undemanding the scala/big-data component, and (2) understand what's being asked. Sometimes the comment in the code are wrong or misleading. In particular in the 2nd set of exercises. The functions are very poorly specified, and there are no unit tests. there should be one or the other. Without a specification the user cannot write his own tests. In addition the 2nd exercise is intended to be do-able, but not efficiently until the user views week 3's videos. Because of this the text output is EXTREMELY verbose, making it impossible to read the error messages and understand them. When the user finally submits the assignment it fails and the grader gives misleading error messages. A failing unit test should at the very least explain what the test was, what the measured value was, and what was expected. This is especially true when the user is forbidden from looking at the actual testing code. An additional problem with exercise 2, is that the student is asked to calculate a particular percentage, but it is not explained what this is a percentage OF and there are several ways to interpret it. I didn't realize until wasting 2 weeks that there was an alternate interpretation which I could try.In the 3rd exercise some of the comments in the code are wrong/misleading. Particularly with regard to classifiedColumns. comment #3 should read:* 3. other activities (leisure). These are the columns starting with ???t02???, ???t04???, ???t06???, ???t07???, ???t08???, ???t09???, ???t10???, ???t12???, ???t13???, ???t14???, ???t15???, ???t16??? and ???t18??? BUT EXCLUDING those which are not part of the previous groups only. Otherwise the sentence is at best grammatically incorrect, and at worst misleading.Another significant issue with this Bit Data course is that it assumes a user understands data base and can construct sql queries. Well, such background is not a prerequisite, but the student needs such information to successfully finish the exercises. I can understand the temptation by the course developers to include a section on SQLspark, as this is a very powerful set of spark libraries, but I believe it is beyond the prerequisites. I could not have finished the course if I hadn't had an SQL/data-base expert in the same office, who I could pose questions to.I hope you find my comments useful."
624,"good stuff, compared to the other similar course in PySpark this one gave me a lot more understanding of how things work in Spark on the low level"
625,Generally a really good introduction to Spark. What I found disturbing though were the very imbalanced difficulties of the excercises and the rather uninformative test messages that did not help for the implementation. There was no course where I had to search for other peoples suggestions in the forums. Still the course was good -- I would do it again!
626,"Quizzes in the lecture videos would be nice. Also more, but shorter videos would be enjoyable. Programming assignments very nice!"
627,"Great introduction to spark. Fun assignments. Since it was the first ever session, there were quite a few kinks with the assignments. But the discussion forums rescued me any time I was stuck."
628,Great course! The powerpoint/slides/pdfs are a GREAT resource
629,"I don't know what happened but it seems they had technical or some other problem while preparing this course. Some assignments were more oriented to solving marginal problems then using Spark and distributed and parallel computing. And that is really annoying. Previous 3 courses were great, maybe this one will improve."
630,First weeks were overcomplicated with k-means and stuff not related to Spark itself.In general - GREAT JOB !!! Thx for such kind courses 
631,"It is a course well organized, full of useful notions e with good assignments to assess your progress in learning stuff. "
632,Excellent course.
633,Production quality exercises. Prepares one for working on Spark almost immediately. 
634,"Great course overall. The feedback on failed tests and out of memory errors on the assignments can be improved to make it more user-friendly. Would be great to see a more advanced version of this course that dives deeper into the machine learning features of Spark, etc."
635,"Very good course, but it needs more details and examples."
636,"Great course, well explained, instant value!"
637,Best Spark Scala course! Clear explanation! Thanks Dr. Heather 
638,This course is a nice guided way to get started with Apache Spark! I wish I took this course earlier when i was using Spark at my previous company. It would've come in handy. Plenty of great content and the course exercises supply good practice.
639,Just awesome :)
640,Cool :)
641,Demystified the subject for me. I felt like the lecturer covered a considerable amount of material in relatively short time. The assignments helped to cement the knowledge acquired over the duration of the course.
642,Good course ! But does need more programming assignments
643,"This is a great course on the intricacies of Apache Spark. It is not a general Big Data course, neither is it an easy one. Doing the programming assignments properly requires reading a lot trough the Spark documentation, which I personally liked as part of the challenge, but beware if you are not that type of person or aim at finishing the course as quickly as possible."
644,Excellent material. Very good flow. Heather has an amazing way of walking through the flow and simplifying the concepts. Great assignments -- takes a bit longer than 3 hours.
645,The course gave me insight into the world och big data batch processing and how Spark solves it. Heather does a great job with presenting the material in a thorough way with relevant theory and illustrative examples. The assignments are well balanced and forces you to apply all your new knowledge when solving them. I highly recommend this course!
646,A very interesting and useful course.Highly Recommended!
647,Great Material and lecture videos. It covered important concepts we need to know about Spark and helped me to learn further. Assignments were on real datasets and helped me to explore different APIs if Spark and Scala.
648,"Really helpful, it's a really good way to get to know how spark works as well as a good round up on basic data mining."
649,Lectures were clear and engaging and directly related to the homework. The assignments were very practical and very hard. Best course of the series!
650,It is very good course material for Spark with scala.
651,Magnificent !
652,Thanks 
653,"Course material was pretty good, but the lectures were hard to watch. Lots of editing problems, and blurring on the text (gave me a headache several times). Would rate higher if the videos were improved."
654,"Great, short course, which gives great insight into Spark and ad-hoc data processing on Hadoop-ish clusters."
655,"Nice course, could use little fixes. Sometimes practice goes ahead of theory "
656,"Took a bit long before the course actually started, but when it did, it was a great course!"
657,"As always, Coursera delivered another top quality courses on Spark with Scala. I have learned a lot of details, understood the underlying working principles of Spark in the last few days. Thanks to Dr. Miller for such a great course. I hope in the future versions of this course the overall presentations will be more smooth and typo-free."
658,"great course, finally understand what spark is all about!"
659,Excellent teacher
660,"Very good and interesting videos. Really clear explanations. Practice part worse, but Forum helps with all misunderstandings."
661,"Dr Heather has done an outstanding job to create this unique material with a fine combination of theoretical and practical aspect of Spark. She has covered almost everything from basic to complex, but there is some area which demands more time from the creator for its explanations. Since this is first time launched course and definitely going to improve itself in upcoming days. I enjoyed this course thoroughly. It helped me, cementing my basic concept of Spark. "
662,"Awesome! Perhaps couple of tests would be handy, just a few to have something to start with."
663,very nicely taught
664,"Excelente curso, muy bien material y explicado de manera muy din??mica y practica."
665,Enjoyed the course and learnt lots. Stimulating material. Though I feel that the week 4 material could be made more concise. On the whole would recommend to other interested and it will definitely help in my career. 
666,Very Good! Maybe more examples!
667,"Great introduction course to Spark with excellent materials and hand-on programming assignments. Thanks for taking effort to get this class online. I have enjoyed it very much. Kudos to Professor Miller, we love you :-)"
668,Very good course.
669,"Very interesting course. Heather presents at just right level of abstraction to my taste and her presentation is very lively so it is easy to stay focused. Formally, this is a course on a particular set of software tools and many such courses are not very useful unless one is to start applying learned skills immdeiately because the material starts getting obsolete the day the course is passed. I believe that this course, however, teaches important priniples that outlive the particular toolkit, in particular the art of reasoning about algorithms on distributed collections, in particular, their performance. One would expect this to be a complex subject but somehow this course makes it feel simple -- which is a good indicator of high quality. "
670,"Good information, but a little rough around the edges, possibly due to being its first time out of the gate. Should be amplified with additional weeks of topics, e.g. on Spark Streaming, etc. The Grader often returns opaque errors (The Grader Failed), when the actual problem was that the program ran out of memory or out of disk space. Grader can reject solutions, e.g. on the last assignment, if the programmer uses a different rounder implementation that returns subtly-different results, though the results print out as the same to the rounded degree of precision. The Grader should be written to accept results that are acceptably close to the desired result, e.g. if the desired result is 34.1, to accept perhaps numbers between 34.099 and 34.101 -- perhaps consult with other course-runners for best practices here. It might be helpful if the course provided a quick intro to running the assignments on DataBricks.Good first effort."
671,very nice material and organized very well. still amazed what spark can do with the data.
672,"The course was interesting but it was clear that it is the first iteration. The course seems rushed, there are not very clear explanations on certain areas. Mostly, I had problems completing the assignments based on what I've learned during the lectures. The previous courses had difficult assignments and you had to think about how you wanted to do something, here the problem was using the Spark API and understanding things which weren't explained in the lectures. Also, not all the areas of the assignments were described.I am sure the course will become better in time."
673,So great!
674,Awesome Course . Detail and Depth of RDD vs Dataframe vs Dataset. Latency vs Network/IO vs Shuffling.Learnt a lot . Thank you Heather.
675,Nice course. Big jump at the end. The assignment is well hinted. 
676,"Excellent and broad view of Spark and its design foundations. Besides the formal knowledge of Spark, it could change my perspective about how Scala and Akka had a crucial role in the Spark architecture."
677,"Good overview of the subject, covering all important aspects. Assignments were well prepared, with a couple of unclear points that were quickly discovered and explained on the forums."
678,I learned a lot and I really enjoyed the course. What I would improve - reference material from upcoming weeks should be organized (or at least added as recommended reading) if it helps the current week assignment.
679,Nice topics regarding using partitions for Spark and encoders!! Really interesting course 
680,Another fun Scala course!
681,good course on spark.
682,This class is great! Highly recomended! It helped me to understand and perform better at my daily working tasks!
683,"The structure, focus content of the videos of this course are great. The assignments are so-so. They do practice writing reasonably realistic Spark jobs in Scala, but it is hard to draw the connection between the more theoretical videos and the very practical assignments. Also, the assignments are hard to solve due to being poorly specified and there being hardly any helpful output from the auto-graders used to evaluate assignment submissions."
684,"Great introduction to Spark and it's data structures. The course is easy to follow, and lecturer is entertaining and really engaged.Thanks, I really had fun ! "
685,Fantastic initiation to Spark. Thanks Heather and the whole team at EPFL &amp; Coursera.
686,Assignment Instructions need improvement in terms of clarity.
687,Very Nice and effective course. One of the best course i have done on Spark online. Many Thanks to the course instructor Heather Miller for creating a very detail and updated course on Spark.
688,It's a great course with lots of insight into spark. At first it's confusing - first rdds; then dataframes and later datasets. But this is by no means the instructors' fault. Heather greatly describes in detail what goes on under the hood and why dataframes are way faster than simple rdds and why we have to give up some of our beloved typesafety of scala-land to let catalyst do its magic. Datasets try to bring some of it back. I really enjoyed coding the assignments. Took me ~2hrs each. The tasks were fun and like those you would find in the wild.I already applied some of the skills I learned here at work and successfully implemented a simple recommendation engine that will go to production next week.Highly recommend this course!
689,"The material in this course is very interesting. However, there were a few important issues:Lots of typos in the slidesLots of problems with the assignmentsAt the end, I feel like a beta-tester (it would be OK if it was clearly stated and if we had a discount).It could also be nice to add 1 or 2 weeks to this course."
690,"It was short and sweet. However, I wish the assignments had more unit tests to fill gaps where the instructions weren't clear."
691,Excellent course. Fun and entertaining. 
692,"goot as introduction about spark and big data. Small notice: it is incorrect to compare performance hadoop and spark. As I understand, spark was expected to be compacred with MapReduce."
693,Brilliant intro to Spark. I really like the enthusiasm with which Heather explains the key concepts.
694,Very fun and informative!
695,"A superb course taught by a superb lecturer. From a lecture stanpoint, my only recommendation is that additional lectures be provided to flesh out the coverage of Datasets. I found the assignments challenging and a good reflection on my understanding of the course material. I would recommend only the following tweaks:Week 1 assignment: Either tightly specify the function that determines if a particular String is present in a large textstring OR provide the function in the assignment skeleton. There are too many ways to approach this function that are correct, but different than the one the grader used. This function is only incidental to the goal of applying one's knowledge of Spark to the assignment.Week 4: Allocate additional lectures to flesh out the coverage of Datasets. The subject was not covered to the same level of detail that the other subjects in the course were given.These are minor points.Well done, Dr Heather Miller!"
696,This course took a lot of work to create. I would have like more quizzes during the lectures and the assignments to have walk through the steps more. The best course I have seen online is the Machine learning course by Andrew Ng. https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome. I did really enjoy the course. Thank you. 
697,"Good material and induction to Spark, good complement of parallel computing in Scala"
698,Awesome course
699,"Slow videos repeating several times the same thing (not a pedagogical / good to fix an idea kind of repetition), which makes them hard to follow. However the worst are the exercises: the first time after 3-4 other Coursera Scala related courses where I have to actively check the forums for minute details about what is expected / implied for the solutions to pass the grading.Things like what to do when updating the kmeans and you have duplicates, subtle differences between average and mean, etc. ...In all other courses the expectation of the exercises were sufficiently clear and straight forward that I never had to check the forums to solve them.Also, the code style of the exercises is literally an anti-pattern in idiomatic Scala, against everything learnt in the previous Scala courses: var all over the place, low level loops like in C or Java, etc. ..."
700,"really good, informative "
701,"The video speed is way to fast, this woman is speaking really fast, first as i slowed the video down at 75% was its ok."
702,"Great course, keep up the good work."
703,"I learned so much from this course! It was amazing how Dr. Miller used concepts that were meticulously built up in the earlier courses, such as evaluation strategy, functional collections, reactive programming, and associativity, to describe the core of Spark in only four units. As someone coming from more of a statistics background, I started this specialization only to learn Spark, so I wasn't always sure how relevant learning the more theoretical underpinnings of Scala would be. It turns out that it was pretty essential, while also just making me a better programmer. Looking forward to the capstone!"
704,"Very well taught and insightful! Especially the combination of slides, and additionally drawn notes on that slides, I found very good. "
705,Challenging but very enlightening. Requires you to read the docs and figure out a lot of stuff on your own. My kind of course!
706,Interesting and challenging course! Thank You!
707,"Some of the assignments are a bit challenging, due to grading system I suppose, but in the end general impression about this course is very positive"
708,AWESOME!
709,"The course covers the important concepts and explains them in detail. Homework tasks really make you think, revisit the lectures and read documentation, until you get it right, and that all deepens understanding of the material.I also obtained some clues for the future: the lectures provided me with context, which helps formulate questions when searching for answers elsewhere. "
710,Thanks Heather! You did a great job with this course. 
711,"Great course, presentations prepared with passion, exercise of right level...."
712,"Lectures are great. Explanation are very clear. Assignment was having issue like incorrect and/or vague reporting which made them needlessly painfull. I'm quite sure that the next iteration of this course can get a 5 star rating, but for now, it's only 3."
713,Excellent in depth explanation of RDD and the API.Heather is super informative and the material is being passed in a practical and explanatory way. Hopefully there will be more courses like this one about Spark Streaming and Machine Learning.
714,Really Awesome course. The instructor is great. Looking forward to more courses from Heather.
715,Great course. Very informative. I have learned a lot. Lessons are very well prepared and structured. Implementation tasks are interesting. Thanks to all EPFL team. Great job!
716,"I really enjoyed this course! First of all I would like to congratulate the people behind this effort. The videos are clear, to the point and they contain very useful information and tips that are very difficult to get from a book. I hope that you will continue with a second course on Spark and Scala with more advanced topics. Thank you very much."
717,Thanks! It's an excellent course.
718,I really liked the assignments in this course and all the content was well explained.
719,"Thank the teacher, the course is very good, the teacher is also very nice. The first three weeks of feeling learned a lot of new knowledge, the last week may be each class time is relatively long. It would be better if you could split it."
720,"So many mistakes in the slides. Coding exercises are so hard to comprehend, it's tough to know what you are trying to achieve. I have already done a course in spark, this was supposed to be just refresher, but now I'm just confused..."
721,Thanks :)
722,Basics are covered in an effective way.
723,"Very average. Lectures could be a fraction of their current length, too much time spent rephrasing the same point (sometimes 3+ times!). It was driving me nuts, my mind would wonder if I didn't focus. It would be nice to have local tests that incrementally check progress similar to Andrew Ng's Machine Learning coursera."
724,Great course. Would definitely recommend.
725,Good course.
726,Great Course! 
727,Great! But I want to know more about dataset! 
728,"This is my first cource review on English, but I want to do accent on Heather's high professionalism, great explanations abilities and great organisation of material. I need to say that I have education of computer science teacher and I can say that it's wonderful cource. It was difficult for me and I've really increased my skill. Thanx. "
729,"Nice course, thanks!"
730,"I had previous experience with Scala and Spark and I really enjoyed the course. I learned some very interesting things, specially y de last 2 weeks about partitioning and Spark SQL."
731,"It gave me very good understanding on Spark Architecture, functioning along with hands on over Scala. Good examples used during lessons."
732,Great lectures and great content!
733,Awesome course !
734,Very good and concise course.
735,I guess it's a goo introduction course into Apache Spark. Meantime I would expect deeper dive into optimizations and algorithms.
736,"Great subject, well explained with solid weekly assignments make this course a stellar learning experience."
737,Good course. Could be more comprehensive about analysis. Content is all video and Lecture notes would be nice.
738,"Great course, learnt a lot from it. Thank you. "
739,"In the assignments, I had the feeling that the goal was more guess what they want than write it correctly using what you have learnt. Stating more clearly the requirements and improving error messages from the grader may help."
740,"Relatively decent video lectures, if not that blurry which makes text hard to read. Accompanied with awful practice lessons: - code templates are written with little to no style, even file reading is done in 3 different ways in all 3 lessons; - grader output is very confusing and almost useless; - unit tests, very useful to avoid some common caveats, were present in the first lesson, disappear completely in the last one.Probably following spark's programming guide is better time investment, even if it misses some humanity of video lectures "
741,"Amazing lectures, and challenging tasks to do on the way. I really enjoyed going through the course, and I learned a lot."
742,"Great course, good intro into Spark."
743,"good: the concepts and on-hands skills taught by the course are good.bad: the assignments. you cannot complete them just by following the course material, forcing you to waste quite a lot of time either: (1) learning from other sources; (2) looking for answers on the forum; or (3) brute forcing an answer till rage quitting :)another bad point: the course is supposed to be focused on spark &amp; big data analysis but it has 1-2 lectures (around 40-60 mins) pretty much devoted to showing some SQL. &lt;&lt; this could be summarized to around 10-20 mins and/or give a link to quickly learn/try to some other source."
744,Very interesting course!!
745,"Very interesting course about Spark, it covers a lot of key concepts!"
746,Good introduction to Spark. One thing that I didn't like was use of simple Ints and Strings instead of types.
747,"Pretty nice course. But with one comment on the grading system, sometime the comment &amp; message is not that intuitive enough."
748,"Yet another excellent Scala class. Good lectures, good assignments. Clear and understandable, while presenting a whole bunch of new concepts."
749,This course is very well done.
750,Instructor has been explaining the concepts with more practical direction
751,"Taking into consideration that this was the first edition of the course, I can say that it has been a nice journey. I am glad about the fact that Heather managed to expose a bit of the Spark internals and not only talk about querying data and how easily this can be made by using Spark (as most of the Spark oriented courses consist of). In addition to this, I could listen to Heather all day long - she's a great presenter and has wonderful teaching skills. However, the homework has outlined some neglected aspects of the course:- vague description or requirements- not strongly related to the presented content (the lectures outlined partitioning mechanism, but the homework 2 did not require it...)- not so meaningful feedback, except for some tests failing/passing - I would have expected something like you did ok, but your job took longer than expected; check out this and thatOverall, it's been a highly expected course and it was nice to get a broader outlook on Spark. I hope that there will be more courses (and more detailed) related to Spark ecosystem in the near future."
752,"Great course, I learned a lot through the course. However, some of the lectures are quite long and could do with being broken down in to more smaller segments."
753,Great course - well prepared by the team.
754,"Gives a really solid overview of the foundations of the Spark programming model, where it came from, and how latency affects this model for a distributed cluster. Explains well the key differenced between RDDs, Datasets, and Dataframes. Thought the videos were unnecessarily long and could do with sharpening them up a bit."
755,"The selection of content is very good. Yet, the course requires solid amount of polishing. I had a feeling that the real teaching started only in the 4th week, with lots of walking around the subject in the beginning. Worth to mention that in contrast to the first 3 courses in Scala specialisation this one is very heavy on visual aspect. You actually have to see the picture, as the voice channel just references it.I can certainly recommend this course to people curious about data analysis. If you have had some experience and would like to try Spark or get better at it, then probably a good book can save your time. "
756,"Learned Spark APIs, internals."
757,Would be better to have more and shorter exercises.
758,"a let down and not up to par with other courses in the series.Huge amount of time is wasted bsically repeating that the API is close to scala collections'. The huge amout of time is wasted again on very simple dataframe APIs including several slides presenting the show() function. Allow me to repeat : several slides presenting the show() function.Finally the assignments are unimaginative and mechanical. The desciption is really confuse and most of the time is spend trying to chase small differences away to please the grader.The sole part of the course that seemed interesting was the shuffling one, that was unfourtunately ignored on the assignmentsNot related to the course but to spark: What utter mess are dataframes and datasets filled with boilerplate type conversions and runtime erros. I shy away in disgust form this untyped IDE-unfriendly monstruosity. "
759,This course is a great introduction to Spark. The only thing I think could be improved is that each programming assignments has unit tests that drive students towards the final solution. I saw lots of people complaining in the forums about this slow and tedious back and forth of having the grader testing their code.
760,"This is a really excellent course. It deals with difficult content clearly, thoroughly and at a good pace. I would now be happy to use Spark in my work and feel I have a strong base to go on to further study. The exercises are well conceived covering fairly realistic use cases and are of about the right complexity. BUT, the feedback from the automatic grading really lets it down.The auto grading tests are at too high a granularity, each test tests too many things. They give cryptic errors such as '&lt;some random element&gt; is empty'. You have no idea why the element is empty as the students are given a different dataset to the one tested on. Moreover, the failed tests are invariably nothing to do with learnt course content, but trivial rounding/formatting errors. The forums are a lifesaver, but I still spent a good two weekends working on bugs once I'd got the assignments 70% right. I would not recommend to a completist!All the same, thanks to Heather for the wonderful work she's done putting it together and the excellent lectures she gives."
761,Very Very Interesting and helpful!The slides' layout is very clear and step by step for each important topic.The motivation of why we need dataframe and dataset and what's their difference is explained with a logical and reasonable way!
762,I really liked the content regarding Dataframes and Datasets. 
763,It was good. Got indepth knowledge of Spark API
764,"Informative. Although, it a week course on architecture of Spark (especially YARN mode), explaining Spark Jobs, Stages &amp; Tasks would be nice addition. Thank you for sharing knowledge and a wonderful learning experience!"
765,I like the course tempo very much. It kept me away from doing anything else while listening to the lectures.
766,It was well worth the wait! The instructor was good. Assignments were challenging as well as hands on!
767,Amazingly polished and well taught course although being given for the first time
768,"I understand that creating such a course is a tremendous amount of work. Let me congratulation the developers for all their hard work. I learned a lot. I'm glad I good the course, and I'm speechless that I finally finished it with a passing albeit imperfect score. This was the maiden voyage and it has some problems that should probably be corrected. That's my opinion. There were generally two sets of challenges with each assignment exercise (1) undemanding the scala/big-data component, and (2) understand what's being asked. Sometimes the comment in the code are wrong or misleading. In particular in the 2nd set of exercises. The functions are very poorly specified, and there are no unit tests. there should be one or the other. Without a specification the user cannot write his own tests. In addition the 2nd exercise is intended to be do-able, but not efficiently until the user views week 3's videos. Because of this the text output is EXTREMELY verbose, making it impossible to read the error messages and understand them. When the user finally submits the assignment it fails and the grader gives misleading error messages. A failing unit test should at the very least explain what the test was, what the measured value was, and what was expected. This is especially true when the user is forbidden from looking at the actual testing code. An additional problem with exercise 2, is that the student is asked to calculate a particular percentage, but it is not explained what this is a percentage OF and there are several ways to interpret it. I didn't realize until wasting 2 weeks that there was an alternate interpretation which I could try.In the 3rd exercise some of the comments in the code are wrong/misleading. Particularly with regard to classifiedColumns. comment #3 should read:* 3. other activities (leisure). These are the columns starting with ???t02???, ???t04???, ???t06???, ???t07???, ???t08???, ???t09???, ???t10???, ???t12???, ???t13???, ???t14???, ???t15???, ???t16??? and ???t18??? BUT EXCLUDING those which are not part of the previous groups only. Otherwise the sentence is at best grammatically incorrect, and at worst misleading.Another significant issue with this Bit Data course is that it assumes a user understands data base and can construct sql queries. Well, such background is not a prerequisite, but the student needs such information to successfully finish the exercises. I can understand the temptation by the course developers to include a section on SQLspark, as this is a very powerful set of spark libraries, but I believe it is beyond the prerequisites. I could not have finished the course if I hadn't had an SQL/data-base expert in the same office, who I could pose questions to.I hope you find my comments useful."
769,"good stuff, compared to the other similar course in PySpark this one gave me a lot more understanding of how things work in Spark on the low level"
770,Generally a really good introduction to Spark. What I found disturbing though were the very imbalanced difficulties of the excercises and the rather uninformative test messages that did not help for the implementation. There was no course where I had to search for other peoples suggestions in the forums. Still the course was good -- I would do it again!
771,"Quizzes in the lecture videos would be nice. Also more, but shorter videos would be enjoyable. Programming assignments very nice!"
772,"Great introduction to spark. Fun assignments. Since it was the first ever session, there were quite a few kinks with the assignments. But the discussion forums rescued me any time I was stuck."
773,Great course! The powerpoint/slides/pdfs are a GREAT resource
774,"I don't know what happened but it seems they had technical or some other problem while preparing this course. Some assignments were more oriented to solving marginal problems then using Spark and distributed and parallel computing. And that is really annoying. Previous 3 courses were great, maybe this one will improve."
775,First weeks were overcomplicated with k-means and stuff not related to Spark itself.In general - GREAT JOB !!! Thx for such kind courses 
776,"It is a course well organized, full of useful notions e with good assignments to assess your progress in learning stuff. "
777,Excellent course.
778,Production quality exercises. Prepares one for working on Spark almost immediately. 
779,"Great course overall. The feedback on failed tests and out of memory errors on the assignments can be improved to make it more user-friendly. Would be great to see a more advanced version of this course that dives deeper into the machine learning features of Spark, etc."
780,"Very good course, but it needs more details and examples."
781,"Great course, well explained, instant value!"
782,Best Spark Scala course! Clear explanation! Thanks Dr. Heather 
783,This course is a nice guided way to get started with Apache Spark! I wish I took this course earlier when i was using Spark at my previous company. It would've come in handy. Plenty of great content and the course exercises supply good practice.
784,Just awesome :)
785,Cool :)
786,Demystified the subject for me. I felt like the lecturer covered a considerable amount of material in relatively short time. The assignments helped to cement the knowledge acquired over the duration of the course.
787,"This is a great course on the intricacies of Apache Spark. It is not a general Big Data course, neither is it an easy one. Doing the programming assignments properly requires reading a lot trough the Spark documentation, which I personally liked as part of the challenge, but beware if you are not that type of person or aim at finishing the course as quickly as possible."
788,Excellent material. Very good flow. Heather has an amazing way of walking through the flow and simplifying the concepts. Great assignments -- takes a bit longer than 3 hours.
789,The course gave me insight into the world och big data batch processing and how Spark solves it. Heather does a great job with presenting the material in a thorough way with relevant theory and illustrative examples. The assignments are well balanced and forces you to apply all your new knowledge when solving them. I highly recommend this course!
790,A very interesting and useful course.Highly Recommended!
791,Great Material and lecture videos. It covered important concepts we need to know about Spark and helped me to learn further. Assignments were on real datasets and helped me to explore different APIs if Spark and Scala.
792,"Really helpful, it's a really good way to get to know how spark works as well as a good round up on basic data mining."
793,Lectures were clear and engaging and directly related to the homework. The assignments were very practical and very hard. Best course of the series!
794,It is very good course material for Spark with scala.
795,Magnificent !
796,Thanks 
797,"Course material was pretty good, but the lectures were hard to watch. Lots of editing problems, and blurring on the text (gave me a headache several times). Would rate higher if the videos were improved."
798,"Great, short course, which gives great insight into Spark and ad-hoc data processing on Hadoop-ish clusters."
799,"Nice course, could use little fixes. Sometimes practice goes ahead of theory "
800,"Took a bit long before the course actually started, but when it did, it was a great course!"
801,"As always, Coursera delivered another top quality courses on Spark with Scala. I have learned a lot of details, understood the underlying working principles of Spark in the last few days. Thanks to Dr. Miller for such a great course. I hope in the future versions of this course the overall presentations will be more smooth and typo-free."
802,"great course, finally understand what spark is all about!"
803,Excellent teacher
804,"Very good and interesting videos. Really clear explanations. Practice part worse, but Forum helps with all misunderstandings."
805,"Dr Heather has done an outstanding job to create this unique material with a fine combination of theoretical and practical aspect of Spark. She has covered almost everything from basic to complex, but there is some area which demands more time from the creator for its explanations. Since this is first time launched course and definitely going to improve itself in upcoming days. I enjoyed this course thoroughly. It helped me, cementing my basic concept of Spark. "
806,"Awesome! Perhaps couple of tests would be handy, just a few to have something to start with."
807,very nicely taught
808,"Excelente curso, muy bien material y explicado de manera muy din??mica y practica."
809,Enjoyed the course and learnt lots. Stimulating material. Though I feel that the week 4 material could be made more concise. On the whole would recommend to other interested and it will definitely help in my career. 
810,Very Good! Maybe more examples!
811,"Great introduction course to Spark with excellent materials and hand-on programming assignments. Thanks for taking effort to get this class online. I have enjoyed it very much. Kudos to Professor Miller, we love you :-)"
812,Very good course.
813,"Very interesting course. Heather presents at just right level of abstraction to my taste and her presentation is very lively so it is easy to stay focused. Formally, this is a course on a particular set of software tools and many such courses are not very useful unless one is to start applying learned skills immdeiately because the material starts getting obsolete the day the course is passed. I believe that this course, however, teaches important priniples that outlive the particular toolkit, in particular the art of reasoning about algorithms on distributed collections, in particular, their performance. One would expect this to be a complex subject but somehow this course makes it feel simple -- which is a good indicator of high quality. "
814,"Good information, but a little rough around the edges, possibly due to being its first time out of the gate. Should be amplified with additional weeks of topics, e.g. on Spark Streaming, etc. The Grader often returns opaque errors (The Grader Failed), when the actual problem was that the program ran out of memory or out of disk space. Grader can reject solutions, e.g. on the last assignment, if the programmer uses a different rounder implementation that returns subtly-different results, though the results print out as the same to the rounded degree of precision. The Grader should be written to accept results that are acceptably close to the desired result, e.g. if the desired result is 34.1, to accept perhaps numbers between 34.099 and 34.101 -- perhaps consult with other course-runners for best practices here. It might be helpful if the course provided a quick intro to running the assignments on DataBricks.Good first effort."
815,very nice material and organized very well. still amazed what spark can do with the data.
816,"The course was interesting but it was clear that it is the first iteration. The course seems rushed, there are not very clear explanations on certain areas. Mostly, I had problems completing the assignments based on what I've learned during the lectures. The previous courses had difficult assignments and you had to think about how you wanted to do something, here the problem was using the Spark API and understanding things which weren't explained in the lectures. Also, not all the areas of the assignments were described.I am sure the course will become better in time."
817,So great!
818,Awesome Course . Detail and Depth of RDD vs Dataframe vs Dataset. Latency vs Network/IO vs Shuffling.Learnt a lot . Thank you Heather.
819,Nice course. Big jump at the end. The assignment is well hinted. 
820,"Excellent and broad view of Spark and its design foundations. Besides the formal knowledge of Spark, it could change my perspective about how Scala and Akka had a crucial role in the Spark architecture."
821,"Good overview of the subject, covering all important aspects. Assignments were well prepared, with a couple of unclear points that were quickly discovered and explained on the forums."
822,I learned a lot and I really enjoyed the course. What I would improve - reference material from upcoming weeks should be organized (or at least added as recommended reading) if it helps the current week assignment.
823,Nice topics regarding using partitions for Spark and encoders!! Really interesting course 
824,Another fun Scala course!
825,good course on spark.
826,This class is great! Highly recomended! It helped me to understand and perform better at my daily working tasks!
827,Fantastic initiation to Spark. Thanks Heather and the whole team at EPFL &amp; Coursera.
828,Assignment Instructions need improvement in terms of clarity.
829,Very Nice and effective course. One of the best course i have done on Spark online. Many Thanks to the course instructor Heather Miller for creating a very detail and updated course on Spark.
830,It's a great course with lots of insight into spark. At first it's confusing - first rdds; then dataframes and later datasets. But this is by no means the instructors' fault. Heather greatly describes in detail what goes on under the hood and why dataframes are way faster than simple rdds and why we have to give up some of our beloved typesafety of scala-land to let catalyst do its magic. Datasets try to bring some of it back. I really enjoyed coding the assignments. Took me ~2hrs each. The tasks were fun and like those you would find in the wild.I already applied some of the skills I learned here at work and successfully implemented a simple recommendation engine that will go to production next week.Highly recommend this course!
831,"The material in this course is very interesting. However, there were a few important issues:Lots of typos in the slidesLots of problems with the assignmentsAt the end, I feel like a beta-tester (it would be OK if it was clearly stated and if we had a discount).It could also be nice to add 1 or 2 weeks to this course."
832,"It was short and sweet. However, I wish the assignments had more unit tests to fill gaps where the instructions weren't clear."
833,Excellent course. Fun and entertaining. 
834,"goot as introduction about spark and big data. Small notice: it is incorrect to compare performance hadoop and spark. As I understand, spark was expected to be compacred with MapReduce."
835,Very fun and informative!
836,"A superb course taught by a superb lecturer. From a lecture stanpoint, my only recommendation is that additional lectures be provided to flesh out the coverage of Datasets. I found the assignments challenging and a good reflection on my understanding of the course material. I would recommend only the following tweaks:Week 1 assignment: Either tightly specify the function that determines if a particular String is present in a large textstring OR provide the function in the assignment skeleton. There are too many ways to approach this function that are correct, but different than the one the grader used. This function is only incidental to the goal of applying one's knowledge of Spark to the assignment.Week 4: Allocate additional lectures to flesh out the coverage of Datasets. The subject was not covered to the same level of detail that the other subjects in the course were given.These are minor points.Well done, Dr Heather Miller!"
837,This course took a lot of work to create. I would have like more quizzes during the lectures and the assignments to have walk through the steps more. The best course I have seen online is the Machine learning course by Andrew Ng. https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome. I did really enjoy the course. Thank you. 
838,"Good material and induction to Spark, good complement of parallel computing in Scala"
839,Awesome course
840,"really good, informative "
841,"The video speed is way to fast, this woman is speaking really fast, first as i slowed the video down at 75% was its ok."
842,"Great course, keep up the good work."
843,"I learned so much from this course! It was amazing how Dr. Miller used concepts that were meticulously built up in the earlier courses, such as evaluation strategy, functional collections, reactive programming, and associativity, to describe the core of Spark in only four units. As someone coming from more of a statistics background, I started this specialization only to learn Spark, so I wasn't always sure how relevant learning the more theoretical underpinnings of Scala would be. It turns out that it was pretty essential, while also just making me a better programmer. Looking forward to the capstone!"
844,Challenging but very enlightening. Requires you to read the docs and figure out a lot of stuff on your own. My kind of course!
845,Interesting and challenging course! Thank You!
846,"Some of the assignments are a bit challenging, due to grading system I suppose, but in the end general impression about this course is very positive"
847,"The course covers the important concepts and explains them in detail. Homework tasks really make you think, revisit the lectures and read documentation, until you get it right, and that all deepens understanding of the material.I also obtained some clues for the future: the lectures provided me with context, which helps formulate questions when searching for answers elsewhere. "
848,Thanks Heather! You did a great job with this course. 
849,"Great course, presentations prepared with passion, exercise of right level...."
850,"Lectures are great. Explanation are very clear. Assignment was having issue like incorrect and/or vague reporting which made them needlessly painfull. I'm quite sure that the next iteration of this course can get a 5 star rating, but for now, it's only 3."
851,Great course. Very informative. I have learned a lot. Lessons are very well prepared and structured. Implementation tasks are interesting. Thanks to all EPFL team. Great job!
852,"I really enjoyed this course! First of all I would like to congratulate the people behind this effort. The videos are clear, to the point and they contain very useful information and tips that are very difficult to get from a book. I hope that you will continue with a second course on Spark and Scala with more advanced topics. Thank you very much."
853,Thanks! It's an excellent course.
854,"I enjoyed a lot specially with the additional materials, giving insight to more in-depth concepts. I guess similar approach would help enrich the course if the course could also provide some basics of Scala so that we do not just copy and paste the commands. I am a programmer myself, but scripts like Scala have their own's very special culture that one has to adapt to it. It is not like Java or C++ which are easier to follow. "
855,Very informative with handson exercises. 
856,Suggest to remove the peer-grade assessment as it could be bias :)
857,Excellent course to get acquainted with the Graps 
858,Can't do the homework because the instructions don't work.
859,not much explanation about the syntax of the commands given in excercises
860,"Great course to get familiar with graph data, graph big data, and query languages in graph data."
861,"It started well, but it became a little hard when Java came in. Apart from that, it was great."
862,Very good project! Hopefully it will be helpful in my future career!
863,"A good topic to continue building upon big data with Graphs, however Week 5 needs some more understandable examples and exercises. "
864,This is one of the toughest and most interesting course at it deals with big data in graph database. Highly recommend this course to those who wants to know graph database.
865,"Thanks to this program, I was able to obtain a job as a data scientist in a big data environment. I built a graphical database using neo4j, which no one else at my workplace had thought to do. I really appreciate the training I got through this specialization."
866,Very poor explanation and very complicated topics.
867,Lower quality when compared to the previous courses in this specialization. Neo4j is very interesting but it is poorly explained. 
868,"This course is supposed to be the most interesting, and most challenged one of this specialization. However i am quite disappointed with the instructor and the contents he put together. He speaks too fast without much clarity, and worst of all, i can tell most of the time he reads from the scripts without really conveying much knowledge about the contents."
869,Greate Course
870,Great hands on examples! Really enjoyed the Neo4j and GraphX Hands On
871,Displaying handson queries graphically would make it more appealing as it was in Neo4j
872,Good approach for introducing to graph analytics
873,All the complexity of the course is concentrated to the last week.
874,"I would have liked to put 5 stars. This topic is so important and relevant to big data. After week 4 hands on part, it became obvious we will not see how to implement or interpret the more abstract graph concepts presented in week 3. That was very disappointing. Moreover, the structure of the course is not as good as the other module. I don't understand the lack of balance between theory and hands on (Not enough hands on to reflect the theory) part.On a constructive note, I would replace some of the theoretical concepts of week 3 with additional information on how to link a graph database to machine learning OR I would add more hands on exercise to help using those more complex concepts and learn how to interpret them. "
875,"I like the content at a high level, and I have a better appreciation for the value of graph analytics. That being said, I struggled with the GraphX hands on exersizes, where many of the Scala commands simply hung."
876,"Very interesting class, large applications possibilities, unfortunately the hands on machine wont work properly "
877,The concepts are brilliantly taught but the technical part that was programming was rushed through and not explained step by step. This is probably out of scope for this course but would have been good to get a little more technical training
878,Thanks so much you are great people
879,"The neo4j parts were good, and nice introduction to graph terminology and concepts. would like to see detailed hands-on for wk#5 (like wk#4 had w/neo4j, which was very well done). like the tools survey and concepts. would like to see recommendations for other course(s), not necessarily in this series or by UC SanDiego, about where to go for deeper math."
880,"Really Thank you for all the big data course, just a little about the 5th course, Graph analytic, I think can must go to the deeper insight with more explanation, some of the modules was really vague!Thank you"
881,"Not so easy, but well worth it!"
882,"Probably because I'm new to all the big data and graph analytics terminologies but the lectures in this chapter were quite difficult to follow in my opinion. The instructor was just talking, not teaching nor explaining, just like someone who prepares notes and is reading to students. The hand-ons were a bit helpful, but overall this class is more for those who already know about the subject. "
883,"Concepts are explained in a rather structured way and hands-on with Neo4j are interesting.The last part with GraphX is pure copy-paste of orders, it is disappointing and not a good way to practive."
884,"Very good material, very good Neo4j hands on for new comers. The critique goes to the coverage of GraphX hands on which, at least to me, is not explained clear enough"
885,I enjoyed this course and learned a great deal.
886,"This course was excellent as an introduction to Graph Analytics and using Neo4j. Not only did I learn a lot, I've been given tasks related to what I've learned in this course after finishing it."
887,Another good and interesting course but the total lack of engagement by the course team and community mentors makes it hard going. 
888,"Good Course to get introduced to Graph Analytics , Neo4j, Cypher Graph Query Language , GraphX through Spark. Really enjoyed hands-on exercises"
889,"The professor is well spoken and the class started out very well. But by the final section the hands on example were simply cut-paste with no explanation of what we were doing or how it worked. It's not the fault of the professor but this course and the Big Data specialization attempts to cover too much information. Graph Analytics should be its own 6 course specialization. But really, to understand graph analytics one should be spending a great deal of time with the subject. Perhaps online courses are not the way to understand such a complex subject."
890,Wonderful course.
891,"This course allowed me to understand graph theory, evaluate graph properties, analitics and routing algorithms. In addition it introduces to neo4j and graphx, that are valuable software platforms for analyzing graphs "
892,"I was unhappy with this. It was clear that this course was pulled together from a superset of other material, and that it was not checked for consistency or completeness. The students were tested on their ability to write down a specific phrase from a video rather than on application of the principles learned from utilization of the graph database tools. (Broccoli -- REALLY???)Further, the lack of response to questions posted in the forum indicates a lack of engagement from instructors and / or facilitators."
893,Need to include more student project design in the course
894,Excellent.
895,First week of 3 min video. Seriously we want to dive into the subject. And the last two weeks should have more content. Felt like much more copy and paste without understanding why you did that. Understand this should be introduction to Big Data... But the price you pay for the introduction is too expensive. 
896,Nice love it.... the best in bigdata
897,best course of the series
898,"Maybe the best course of all the specialisation. Good balance between theory and hand-ons. I would give the fifth star with more details and explanations in some hand-ons (mainly the ones from the last lesson). In summary, a good introductory course to graph analysis."
899,"The material on graph analytics was of introductory level. A string of interesting ideas, with unclear explanations. The lesson on GraphX was basically a copy-paste introduction to it's abilities without actually teaching how to use it. The transcripts are full of mistakes. Someone not proficient in English or hard of hearing would be confused by them. It was somewhat difficult to understand the main lecturer. The best part was the explanation of Neo4j - and it was at an introductory level. A disappointment."
900,"Great course. The reason I did not give it five stars because I thought the last week of the course was not up to par with the first 4 weeks. The lessons on Giraph and GraphX were confusing in my opinion and the hands on exercise did not really clear things up for me. Otherwise, a great course."
901, interesting practices with neo4j

944,The course material is not sufficient to work out the exercises. For the Spark final quiz you will have to take up another course to pass this one. 
945,"The virtual machine for running the environment is, at start, a good idea. But even with 8 core i7 with 8G of RAM laptop, it was sometime painful to process the exercices. Maybe an ubuntu/virtualbox/laptop compatibility..."
946,"Curso notable, completo y did??ctico. Sin embargo algunas tareas se hacen muy complicadas para aquellos sin experiencia ni conocimiento amplio en materia de programaci??n, ya que las instrucciones no ayudan por completo para aquellos m??s inexpertos. "
947,The final quiz was a bit tough and needed understanding and googling
948,"Very interesting course, and a good practical exercise at the end"
949,"What a great relief, after passing that last quiz, it took my entire Memorial Day weekend, after the Microsoft Windows 10 Creators upgrade totally ruined my Virtualbox installation for the Cloudera QuickStart VM. Looks like that is a very very good quiz. "
950,"Great course, only a bit difficult on Spark assignment for the people that are not familiar (or a bit rusty) with python and programming.Thanks againluca"
951,It was A greate course 
952,Excellent!
953,the quiz at the end is impossible to solve with the course content.
954,"Excellent course design, it gives you basic of MongoDB, Splunk and Apache Spark. Happy learning and think BIG DATA"
955,"Very good course, and challenging, by the way. Thanks a lot!"
956,Excellent course and very demanding! I really enjoyed. 
957,Get a better description in the week 6
958,"the course content is critical and as it appears in many interviews, and the fundamental understanding is important for beginners to learn this new area. however I think the software (spark or mongoDB) can be taught in a more systematic way (at least point out some resources that can help people learn them based on individual needs). I understand this course is for beginners and people supposed to learn deeper on themselves. but a road map will be helpful and reduce the pain finishing the tests."
959,I enjoyed this course. I learnt a lot of stuff about Big Data processing in a simple and clear way.
960,Pros: covers lots of good topics about Big DataCons: No real big data exercise
961,"We need more exercises to use phyton and spark because with only the examples the hands on quizes are very complicated and I feel that I'm not understanding very well how to use the bigdata tools, is more like error and proof than real learningthanks a lot!!!"
962,The materials explaining the course are too poor. This is a core course in the specialization.The quizzes are out of the material's league
963,"Very Good Course! I'd never used spark before, and doing (and passing) the assignment on it was very rewarding!"
964,"This course is more hands on than previous courses, I've found it very interesting and useful"
965,"I think the last project was very badly positioned and explained. First the Coursera is using Cloudera VM, but if you execute and run the Cloudera Express to set the Cloundera environment up the Coursea exercises do not run There should be a warning!. If you do then the simplest Jupyter exercise it fails - this took me about 10 hours to figure out.Then for the final Project, technically to succeed you must miss country names in all lower case and you cannot match with countries with a 'space' e.g. 'Cape Verdi' and if you try to take any of this into account you do not get the same numbers to pass the test. There needs to be some warning on how to interpret and manage the files so that you get the same numbers being asked for in the test. Again this too me about 10 hours to resolve. Both resolutions ONLY because another colleague is doing the same course and we problem solved together. THIS IS AN AWFUL EXERCISE in frustration due to incomplete details. Not a learning exercise. Just AWFUL...."
966,One of the best ways to start to be in contact with the real Big Data Tools
967,Thank you. Spark in this course is very helpful.
968,Course was excellent. I liked the hands on sessions the most. Not too easy and not too difficult. They encourage you to explore more and learn more.
969,"The course and presentations were very informational and good. I enjoyed that aspect. I would have rated the course 4-5 star based on that. The reason for the low rating was the 6th module, and the fact that I felt very ill prepared for the syntax of creating all the operations in Spark (building out the Jupiter notebook). We really did not cover much of that, and it was quite punishing to search the web and sources to make things work. Even the instructions to export the csv file were misleading at best. I have a full time job and a family, I am not some young undergraduate with copious amounts of time to waste. While I am not opposed to some searching of other sources, I would like to have more of the useful information taught so that it is not so much of a burden. I believe that if you are going to test people on something, you should at least cover it in some sense."
970,The VM doesn't work out of the box sometimes for the hands on activities
971,"A little slower than the last ones, not my favorite but great use of hands-on projects and enagagement"
972,This has been one of the best courses ever. A really good insight into big data. I will recommend it to all people trying to get into data scientist.
973,I have enrolled in this twice but can't see the course content. Every time I click go to course I get directed to the description of the course. Where are the lecture videos and other course content?
974,Lot of learning in this course compared to the first two courses. 
975,Big data integration and processing is a very nice theoretical course on big data integrations systems and also includes a bunch of practical exercises with big data integration products. The assignments including mongodb and apache spark are worth doing. 
976,Very good course and professors. I recommend it. 
977,"Poor presentation of topics, I don't recommend."
978,I found this course like the others. I really liked the hands on labs. It gave a real feel for the programs being explained
979,I learned a lot of implementation of the techniques and concepts that were covered earlier. A great experience.
980,Lots of learning of programming Spark and MongoDB
981,"The course was good enough...but exercises were very simple. Only the final course was little bit challenging. For a guy that sits in IT business for a while it's rather too simple. Besides, I've learned spark basics which is super cool...so thanks for thatMaybe you could consider to build docker image instead of using virtual machines. VM is ok, but I think that docker can simplify all the stuff without necessary downloading, installations etc.Looking forward to the next spark challenges :)"
982,Lots of good hands-on and explanation...
983,"Goog hands-on and assessments, i like it and it took me sometime and reading to solve itThanks"
984,course is very good. Excercises are very good. learnt alot about the mongodb and spark sql and RDD's
985,"interesting course, I learned a lot about MongoDB "
986,"Programming instructions were not clear, and the version of Python that was installed on my machine did not support the Jupy"
987,a wide spectrum of tools practiced. awesome!
988,"The last assignment of the course is, compared to the others, more difficult. In my case, I ran into several errors which I couldn't get help in solving by using the course Forum, as the end of course deadline was just a few days ahead. I had to analyze the tweet texts for the last graded assignment without using Spark framework (nor any of the other Big Data tools explored in the course).I also found some of the videos by PhD. Amarnath Gupta were difficult to understand, his examples were unclear and, in my opinion, too complex and difficult to follow and understand what was the reasoning thread. "
989,"some of the stuff was not mentioned properly, like for last quiz how to expoert data from mongodb"
990,I miss a proper buildup from the theory to the practical exercises. Especially the last quiz I found very difficult based on the limited number of exercises presented upfront.
991,Good amount of theory and also hands-on exercises with some of the tools.
992,This course is great!!! I love the handson most. Working with tweet text was really challenging for me but it was worth the time and effort. 
993,Very well explained!! This course and specialization are really good!
994,Excelent practical course
995,The Spark introduction and exercises were good. It would be an added advantage if the final steps/answers also get published. 
996,"The assessments are quite tough compared to the course examples. Moreover, some programming basics should be given or made to understand, especially in Spark, as these are very"
997,"The best course so far (still not doing 4,5,6). It is more complex than the first two."
998,wonderful course but information much more condense for beginners for this course is hard because lots of error and even no solution on cloudera community blog. first experience with Mongodb after this course i am able to say that yes i have knowledge how to work with mongo and spark at beginners level. 
999,Content was good however we need to get more support on hands on as sometime we feel that we are stuck due to non availability of the right 
1000,"Some of the lectures seemed slightly lesser quality with regards to the materials. For moocs especially, I would like to have the lecture better documented in order to download and review later."
1001,excellent.congratulations
1002,"I had a considerable difficulty with the last exercise because it seams to aim to a different level of students than the ones that followed the rest of the course. I would suggest to put the rest of the course, videos, exercises, etc. to the level of the fine_project which, in my opinion, is the correct level."
1003,"Poorly designed, no help whatsoever from the staff, Forum is totally worthless. Worst course I ever had on Coursera."
1004,"I feel the contents of this course were great, no second thought on it. It makes your concepts crystal clear. But faced lots of issues during practicing the hands on exercises and did not get proper feedback or response on any of the queries."
1005,"It was a good course, different data sources and spark in action"
1006,The lectures were very structured and informative. The quizes were challenging. The final week was demanding and fleshed out concepts
1007,It was a very helpful course in understanding of the Big Data Integration and Processing. Learned a lot. Thanks to the instructors and Coursera team.
1008,I had many problems with the final two programming assignments with running Spark in the VM and there isn't a lot of help available online. 
1009,Good last week practice!!
1010,"Very challenging, specially in the week 6 quizzes where a lot of researching took place in order to pass it. "
1011,Excellent..but not easy. Be prepared to have to do some research! But hey....isn't that part of being a data scientist!
1012, Great course! The practices were very useful to me to understand the subjects. 
1013,Awful
1014,"The final assessment somewhat not really well designed, imho."
1015,Needs more depth. Instructors should reference more external readings since the lectures are brief.
1016,Good experience of using the big data tools but a total lack of engagement in the forums by the instructors and community mentors make it hard going if anything goes wrong. The final quiz took me over 8 hours mostly because there was no one to ask for hints when I was totally stuck and confused! 
1017,Best course
1018,"Course is well balanced between theory and practical exercises. Assignments in week 6 for me was challenging but very instructive. I learned many interesting, and useful in real world, things."
1019,"Overall this course does have some good content and delivers big data concepts. However, as others have mentioned some content (especially in early modules) could either be combined or ommited. Key focus areas on Spark and MongoDB are not given enough focus and lab time. The quizes have badly worded questions. Finally the last assignment required to pass the class has bad directions and covers content not reviewed in the class. Spent a frustrating amount of time trying to get what most likely is simple code to work. I'm hoping this particular module is revised. For those just interested in learning Spark or Mongo and not doing the certificate program you can probably get better learning from doing your own research."
1020,Great course !!!
1021,I recommend more practical work but as an introductory course it is OK.
1022,Quizes are inconsistent with given dataset. Questions are bad: i.e. what is the difference between number of distinct countries mentioned and number of countries mentioned in tweets.
1023,"This is a very descent to understand MongoDB and Apache Spark. It contains hands on assignments will will allow you to learn how to handle these two software. The course is introductory level, and I recommend this course to people who have not used MongoDB and Apache Spark."
1024,It's good
1025,I tried giving zero stars. This course is very poor. In particular the last portion of the class wherein you are tested on things that were not taught. If I had wanted to spend hours in google trying to learn this stuff I would not have spent money on this course.
1026,"Loved it! Very practical and hands-on, with a variety of platforms used on practical examples. I'm off to analyse some social media data soon just for fun :)"
1027,"Best course taking into account the first three. Good material, more in depth than the other ones. Very well explained. Useful to get a sense of various interesting topics and orientative."
1028,"I felt this module, like most, represented good value for money. It's obviously not exhaustive, but you shouldn't expect it to be for the price.The final quiz was a nice challenge and struck a good balance between course material and requiring you to research information online."
1029,The course cost too much for the gain of knowledge. Feels like this course could be merge with the first or the third course.
1030,"Forcing users to install demo software which requires a registration is just too lame.Other than that, courser is very boring, introductory, jumps constantly between things and doesn't explain much. Stack overflow and 2 hours would do a better job."
1031,"The virtual machine for running the environment is, at start, a good idea. But even with 8 core i7 with 8G of RAM laptop, it was sometime painful to process the exercices. Maybe an ubuntu/virtualbox/laptop compatibility..."
1032,"Curso notable, completo y did??ctico. Sin embargo algunas tareas se hacen muy complicadas para aquellos sin experiencia ni conocimiento amplio en materia de programaci??n, ya que las instrucciones no ayudan por completo para aquellos m??s inexpertos. "
1033,The final quiz was a bit tough and needed understanding and googling
1034,"Very interesting course, and a good practical exercise at the end"
1035,"What a great relief, after passing that last quiz, it took my entire Memorial Day weekend, after the Microsoft Windows 10 Creators upgrade totally ruined my Virtualbox installation for the Cloudera QuickStart VM. Looks like that is a very very good quiz. "
1036,"Great course, only a bit difficult on Spark assignment for the people that are not familiar (or a bit rusty) with python and programming.Thanks againluca"
1037,It was A greate course 
1038,Excellent!
1039,the quiz at the end is impossible to solve with the course content.
1040,"Excellent course design, it gives you basic of MongoDB, Splunk and Apache Spark. Happy learning and think BIG DATA"

1112,I really liked the course. I learned a lot.
1113,"An Awesome tutorial to start learning Data science using Python and its Libraries ( NUMPY, PANDAS and etc...)"
1114,"The course is great for senior data analyst. However, you need to learn by yourself probability and statistics because they do not cover them in this course."
1115,Awesome !!!
1116,Tough speed - learning effect created by the weekly assignments. Good start into data sience.
1117,"The course is overall very good and is definitely a very complete introduction to the topic.Sometimes I found the pace of the course a bit too fast: it's quite difficult to focus on the Professor's explanations and, at the very same time, follow the commands typed on the jupyter notebook (not to mention reproducing them on my own!!). The python exercises are overall quite well done, even though in some parts they could benefit from clearer explanations (thankfully almost always provided in the discussion section). Be careful that often the programming assignments go beyond what has been explained in the lectures and therefore require an active search in the documentation, on online forum such as stack overflow or in the resources section."
1118,Gained a lot of knowledge on using the pandas library in a short time. Introduced interesting topics on different data science topics like Goodhart's law etc.
1119,"Excellent course, the teacher gives clear introduction, and the exercise is very useful to train our skill. I have no hesitation to recommend it to my classmates."
1120,"Great introductory course on data science in python. However, the final projects diverts significantly from the course material, requiring vast amounts of self-study for someone new to Python. Definitely learned a lot in this course."
1121,"The videos are not so comprehensive! but by doing exercises, your coding skills will improve."
1122,Thanks
1123,simply the best intro to data science!
1124,Very well prepared. 4 stars because it only scratches the surface of data wrangling with Pandas. I'd love to see more comprehensive course about Pandas.
1125,"Excellent introductory course to Pandas. Four stars because the pace of the videos are too fast and the assignments requires, sometimes, excesive individual learning. Hopefully the info found in the forums is very helpfull. "
1126,Very good starter on learning the basics for python data analysis.
1127,"Not a bad starter, considering it's a free course, but the lectures were somewhat short. Some things from lectures and tasks were pretty discouraging. For example, on week 4 there is a task that culminates in doing a T-test, but all that the lecturer says about it is I'm not going to go into detail here, read wikipedia page or take a statistics course to know what the t-test is. Well, it's definitely not a nice thing to say on an introductory course. Same goes to Pearson correlation coefficient - it's in the task, but not explained anywhere on the course. Not all of us have a background in statistics.Tasks are implemented in the form of IPython notebooks (essentially a web page where one can write Python code) and rated by an automated rater, which sometimes gives good clues, but sometimes result was incorrect is all you get in response. What I felt was not very convenient is that the rater is asynchronous - you can't run it directly on your current notebook, you have to send your work to be rated using a special button instead. Then after some minutes yo can see the result on a separate page. It works, but slows down the process a bit."
1128,The course was wonderful. Really helped in understanding what Data Science is about.
1129,"Very interesting course, with good assignments. It's a nice introduction to Python."
1130,Too many things to learn. The best Python course I've had so far!!
1131,very good course and the lecturer is very good.
1132,The course is quite challenging on weekly assignments. I learned a lot striving to pass.
1133,"Great experience , online video's explained the idea of the concept but the learner need to practice off line mode a lot to get through all the concepts listed in the course and assignment. these practices will improve self learning skill and confidence. Thank you."
1134,Excellent course. Well-organized lecture material and extremely relevant intro to Python and Pandas.
1135,good intro
1136,Good introduction to Pandas library
1137,Very helpful in learning Pandas. Overall a very well designed short course. The only minor difficulty I had was HW submission. It took some time to figure out what could be wrong.
1138,Great intro course for Python!
1139,Good. I learned lots of things from this course
1140,Tough course for a Introduction to... course title. Good support resources saved the day. Learnt from doing the assignments and following the tips from the teaching staff. Very practical assignments. Gave a flavor of what data science work involves. Challenging and engaging. The course videos are very well produced. Prof. Brooks is motivating and energizing. The course also gave a human dimension to the work of data science. Thank you.
1141,"Good course; a great intro to relevant concepts with guidance towards realistic tasks. Only negative is that sometimes problems are unclear (maybe its just me) and spent too much time trying to get outputs exactly right to pass auto-grader. Good experience, and I plan on continuing with the specialization."
1142,"This is a very helpful course. The main advantage is that you will learn a lot of new ways to do operations over data. And this is an intermediary course that assumes that you already know about statistics, mathematics behind data. From my experience I want to tell that if you are taking this course don't just rely on the video this course provide (however videos gives you full context on the work that has to be done), you have to do your own research and reading from external sources too. "
1143,"The explanation and content in teaching video is too brief for the assignment. It cannot not provide sufficient concept and knowledge for student to complete it, especially who not familiar with pandas."
1144,"Course was good , i wish number of exercises were more."
1145,"Excellent course, and very well taught. The projects are a bit difficult for beginners and will require independent learning as well as revising the lectures, but such is anything important in life.The only thing I think the course can benefit from is a printed summary of lectures, since they can be quite dense with information! But I think the Jupyter Notebooks are a good inclusion as is."
1146,"I thought there were going to be more lecture style, more videos to listen, more examples, and more things to learn. What I end up doing was to read stackoverflow as suggested by the instructor, and to do homework. I understand that I have to learn by practice, but I still expected that the instructor will give more material for me to learn before I practice, not to practice by learning from stackoverflow. Assign a reading material or pages/chapters in a textbook to read is still better than asking me to find everything by myself from stackoverflow. To be fair, I learned python, padas, and dataframe from this course as promised by the syllabus. At the end, I think I just got what $79 can do for me, not good, not bad, it is OK. If I knew that it was going to be like this, I will pay for it, yes still pay for it. Does it worth my money, yes for $79. Do I like it very much, no. I think this course can be better if more material/videos can be added. Will I continue to other courses in this series, yes $79 is a fair price."
1147,Very good course although the assagissements are a little bit too difficult (at least to me...) 
1148,very good course
1149,Some issues when validating the assignements automatically but the forums are very helpful. Overall great course to start learning python and the libraries pandas and numpy.
1150,Congratulation ... This is a course that any python biginner have to see
1151,"There were some gaps that were tough to bridge, but I got there."
1152,"At the end of the course, I feel the confidence it has given me in handling data."
1153,The course was easy to understand. The reason i'm giving 3 stars is more on the preparation of the entire set of courses. They kinda develop as the course goes. The other 4 courses of the specialization were not even ready after this course was done. 
1154,It's awesome!
1155,"The course per se deserves 5 stars, however the grader (=the program which checks you programming) is a pain in the a**. I once submitted a float but it wanted a float 64 ... well yea ...The Tips in the discussion forum are great - however they could be highlighted better (e.g. extra post).I especially loved the discussion prompts. I thought them very important."
1156,Fantastic course with a lot of details &amp; focus on Python.
1157,Good data science course for those having programming background with fair knowledge of python.
1158,Well organized and detailed. I like the way the lectures organized.
1159,"A very clear introduction to using Pandas for handling data. The integration of Jupyter Notebooks in both the assignments and the in-lecture pop-ups was very effective. I also appreciated the balance of covering most of the material in lectures, but leaving you to track down some things for the assignments. I can only hope the next courses in this progression are this well done. "
1160,It's a great course with attention to detail. The assignments are very detailed which help a lot in grasping the key concepts.
1161,Fully recommended course.
1162,Very useful revision of basic Python skills required to perform the assignments and introduction of useful new tools and concepts to acquire and prepare data for later manipulation and analysis.
1163,"I learnded how to effectively use pandas to process data, very good lesssons"
1164,"Great learning experience with a very good teacher. A little bit difficult but, hey this is science!"
1165,"They follow a practical approach and present you only the very relevant material so you do not stuck too much into theory. Note that this is an intermediate-level course and you need some experience, self-learning skills, and some patience to be successful. "
1166,"In the beginning I thought that the course should have more Tips and Help to the student.After finishing it, I understand that having the ability to search for the solution without too helping is good to produce the data science skills."
1167,"Awesome course to start study datascience using python, nice and hard projects to do!"
1168,Excellent course with very challenging assignments!
1169,"The main focus of the course is the introduction of the Pandas (series and data frames) library, which is very useful in data analysis. The last two assignments are quite challenging and time consuming, if you are not familiar with Pandas. Why the poor review: I'm sure that the intention of the teacher (Prof. Brooks) is for the student to be challenged and obtain familiarity with several advanced functionalities of Python. When I had finished the last assignment I felt that way, but not due to the lectures (only ~2.5 hours all in all). The pace of these lectures is too fast (probably because they are scripted). The teacher should slow down a bit and show some more examples (for inspiration watch Prof. Andrew Ng from Stanford lecture on machine learning). I'm not suggesting to show explicit solutions of the assignments, but just a few more examples such that the transition from lecture to problem solving is less frustrating. Furthermore, the students are paying $79 for this course expecting thorough lectures on the topic. Reading the documentation of the Pandas library can be done for free..."
1170,This course was really useful. It progressed at a good pace and concepts were explained clearly.
1171,it creates my base and provide me an overview of Data Science.Great assignments to play with real time data.
1172,Good introduction to Pandas and Numpy. I enjoyed the assignments.
1173,Great course! Covers important features of Python which are most likely to be used in Data Science. Programming assignments are really interesting.
1174,tough but glad I make it through
1175,Awesome work :)
1176,"The examples are a bit too extreme head on, I have experience with python but the level at which this is provided is quite hard for anyone to jump in and it should not be advertised as such"
1177,Great course for beginners in data science with some knowledge in python. Nice techniques for data cleaning and transformation are shown. But one needs more than what is in the lecture videos to complete the assignments.
1178,This source has been proven to be very useful during my data science internship. I was doing tasks for data wrangling which require heavy pandas syntax and this source has provided me with exactly that.
1179,Great course.
1180,very good
1181,I recommend this cours.Every Things are well explained
1182,Great course. It provide a good platform to understand Python with Pandas in depth. 
1183,Fantastic way to learn pandas 
1184,Very complete and challenging course. Highly recommend to those who want to get the basics (as it was in my case). Staff is very supportive and constantly answering on the forums.Congratulations to the University of Michigan
1185,"Great course to get started on with Data Science. Lectures are simple and to the point, questions are challenging and practical. Adding a little more theoretical background to the subject would bring more strength to the course."
1186,Good introduction. Hoping to see an intermediate course. 
1187,"The materials are great, but the pace is too fast, I can hardy catch up. Really need to slow down a little bit."
1188,Knew basic idea about how to manipulate data with Python
1189,"Great class, not overwhelming, right pace to learn when you are working a day job."
1190,Great course. I enjoyed from beginning till end. Lectures are very clear and assignments focused on based on real data. Thanks a lot.
1191,Challenging and fun course. I can see how powerful this methodology can be.
1192,Good Course 
1193,Definitely one of the most useful courses I have done in Coursera. Took me a while to get the rhythm but after that everything was smooth. As it says you will really need an INTERMEDIATE level of Python for it. 
1194,"very good, but some difficult to finish the assignment if have no coding experience."
1195,What a great course! I have some R and Matlab experience and it was a perfect course for me to hit the ground running with Python.
1196,Good through introduction to using Pandas. Instruction needs to go into more examples and explanations. I needed to use stackoverflow to get through 60% of the assignments. Few assignment questions are ambiguous and I never found out why my answer is incorrect. Where's the solutions?
1197,Excellent course to learn about pandas and numpy
1198,Great introduction to the basics of the pandas library with plenty of opportunity for self-driven learning and exploration.
1199,"An excellent course, which requires more self learning than what is taught. I extended the course and completed the final assignment in a week. The assignments involving data cleaning actually helps a budding data scientist. Documentation, Stack Overflow for assignments is a must which can boost your understanding not just for this course but for a lot more. My personal satisfaction about this course is mainly stackoverflow part which helped me to understand the lectures weeks ahead. But application of the concepts on assignments is a difficult one which can only be mastered after practice. Thanks to all mentors, especially Sophie Greene whom I followed a lot. Her debugs, algos and code checks have actually helped me to understand both python and Pandas better. "
1200,"The assignments of the course are hard and make you go deep into python, to try to find the answers. I spent more time than I expected on it, but once my target is knowledge I really enjoy. Recommend! (Attention: It is strongly recommend knows programming before enroll)"
1201,The course was very helpful. Learned a lot from the problems. 
1202,"This has been a eye opening experience, it allows you to thing about normal life and the way we handle data differently, the course is very bast to be an introduction level but I didn't mind it at all, I'm happy it is this way."
1203,One of the worst course I ever take in coursera. The instructor just writes codes on front of us without explanation. 
1204,"It is a good course, but a little difficult for a newer."
1205,This course is great but you have to be a good self learner and explorer as it is very difficult to catch up with the speed of the course. The content they tell is not enough but is great for a self start.
1206,Brilliant course which introduces you to Pandas module. I am very eager to participate in follow-up courses.
1207,This course is very useful for those who have a little foundametion of python but not familiar. 
1208,"Introduction to Data Science in Python is good starter course helped me to introduce to lot of concepts needed for basic retrieval, cleaning and manipulating. But I thought teaching can be little more expanded to give more detailed information. Assignments were good, but some are little complicated for the starter. I appreciate Staffing team in helping to us in all possible ways with approach and expected behaviors, validation scripts etc. Thanks to all Staff."
1209,This course worked better as a guide than it did as a course. I learned very little from the lectures and had to do most of my learning on my own. One of the assignment even explicitly told students they would have to go learn on their own.
1210,good one
1211,"Excellent introductory course for data analysis in Python, specifically using Pandas library.I learnt a lot in a short time. Assignments are not easy to solve, they make you think hard, explore more on internet and on user forums, thus making you grasp the topics in depth. This is the best starter course for anyone seeking a career in Data Science using Python."
1212,the course is really precise and explained well
1213,"I appreciate this specialization's patience to begin teaching data science with such a thorough introduction to handling data in python. The lectures are concise, with 80-90% of my time time spent on the assignments. The creators of the course have a clear understanding that most of a data scientist's job is spent cleaning data, and it's incredibly important to get the practice offered by this course."
1214,Good class challenging but fun!
1215,"The course doesn't feel complete, the information and techniques used for assignments can be found completely online through documentation and instead this is merely an exercise for doing basic analysis through documentation rather than an explanation of python through data science (which is what I anticipated)"
1216,"frankly, it takes a lot of searching information on one's own, outside of this course.I raked my brains for the most of Saturday and Sunday and finished two last assigments although I still don't feel strong in pandas, neither there is much material left here for me to come back and review something step by step in a systematic way. "
1217,Its a very good course to start learning for data analysis which can work as a foundation to learn more in data science and machine learning.
1218,Great course! Some of the homework questions seemed a little ambiguous but I was able to find clarification in the course discussion. All in all I learned a lot.
1219,"Very dense, well taught, examples and assignments help in the learning process, I've done many, many Coursera courses, this one in the Top5"
1220,This course is excellent for newbies in learning data science. It gives a comprehensive description about data science .
1221,a decent introduction into the world of python dataframes via the pandas library
1222,"Tasks sometimes a bit tacit to understand what exactly should we return and in what format, but course is great!"
1223,Great tutor and interactive build up from fundamentals to the very challenging concepts..
1224,Good course to get you thinking about python
1225,"Content was generally well covered. One improvement could have been slightly better examples of how there are multiple different ways to solve the same problems; the instructor would often allude to this but would just advise the student to read through the pandas docs, which could be non-intuitive at times."
1226,Very Good!
1227,Excelente. Va un poco m??s all??.
1228,"Very informative. Would be interested to see the correct way to complete many of the assignments, as I'm sure there are more elegant ways to complete them than I used"
1229,Nice course for beginners
1230,excellent course
1231,"Much harder than I thought. Very in-depth introductory learning of python.Preferably better if you allow scripting in .py because notebook is rather heavy and hard todebug while assignments..Hope you cover a bit more in detail with language structure, as well as give hints for solving assignments, since many parts were pretty above course level.I would say the assignments were hard even for an R practitioner learning python like myself."
1232,"just begun, but so far so good. I will update the stars as the weeks progress!!"
1233,Good course the assignments were challenging
1234,Very good course with some challenging assignments that put to test many of my python capabilities
1235,Much more difficult assignments than taught in lectures
1236,The teach and assignment are not in line in difficulty levels.
1237,Excellent !!!
1238,This is a great course to learn about Data Science techniques. The profesors explains all the topics clearly
1239,Top course!
1240,"course material good, mentors very very helpful and active , as mentioned in one of the posts the expected output of an answer in pictorial form can help students a lot , and the assignments were a little on the tough side , even being from a programming background i had to put a lot of effort to figure out silly mistakes and complete this first course but a nice experience , keep it up coursera."
1241,Learning at its best through this course
1242,One of the most useful courses to start a career in the field of Data Science. The assignment were really challenging and interesting
1243,"Very difficult if you are unfamiliar with python, but achievable. Assignments can be frustrating to get just right for the autograder, but you learn important subtleties in the meantime. Cannot wait to complete the rest of the courses in this specialization!!"
1244,Assignment 4 is difficult to understand. 
1245,Very helpful for data analysis.
1246,Gave me a thorough understanding of Python and Data Science. Thanks to the team! :) 
1247,Nice course! Pushing you to practice and lert you act on your own to find accurate results.I thinks that this is the best way to learn if you want to start a career in Data Science
1248,This is an excellent course which should be taken when you want to practice Pandas!
1249,Good introduction to pyhton and data science
1250,Lectures are too fast!
1251,Unorganized and not very useful. The main goal of the course is for you to use Stack Overflow.....SAVE YOURSELF $
1252,Nice introductory course for using python in datascience
1253,Very Good Course
1254,Great introduction to data scientist!
1255,"In my opinion, the assignments problems could be more clearily explained, I think it could be improved for next sessions."
1256,Recommend this course to people new to Python and want to learn basic data science techniques quickly. Very inspiring lectures given by professor and very helpful instructions given by mentors and teaching assistant. 
1257,"Very poor course, badly taught and terrible value for money. The lessons are brief beyond any form of reasonableness, the teacher seems completely unconnected with his students. There is no detail at all and no logical progression. I took and passed this course with a view to doing the specialisation but I'm not going to waste any more money on University of Michigan courses. I've found similar courses on other platforms which cover the same material. The assignments were awful, in some cases they covered material to be presented the following week, in others the questions were wrongly stated and did not match the output from the machine grading. The machine grading itself gave you no clue as to where you went wrong. I'm not talking about the odd question here or there, I'm talking about consistently throughout every assignment. I don't normally, in fact ever, leave bad reviews, I usually just chalk it up to experience and move on but in this case, the course was so bad, I had to say something. I've done two other courses on Coursera with Rice University and the difference to this course is huge, while I would wholeheartedly recommend the Rice Intro to Python courses, Don't do this course, it is not coherently presented or graded. The mentors in the forum tried their best but even they had to admit the grading system was riddled with errors. Absolute rubbish, avoid and spend your money elsewhere."
1258,Super useful!
1259,A worthy course to begin Python &amp; Data Science with. I enjoyed learning Data Science in Python.
1260,Nice Course.... it makes me a little bit stressed cause same bug and other. But I'M REALLY ENJOY this course. Can't wait next course in this series. :)
1261,"Definitely one of the best course I have taken so far.The course started with refreshing the python basics and then it's a deep dive in to the ocean of Data Cleaning tasks.Special Thanks to Dr Brooks for keeping the course straight forward and simple. All the concepts are made very clear during lecture and the assignments are a perfect application of these concepts.Even though assignments are challenging, will feel the sense of accomplishment on completing these.Thanks to the entire course team for the course. "
1262,Excellent.
1263,Lectures are very informative. Liked assignments because they were opened enough to seek for a new information by yourself - that's a thing everyone must improve.
1264,"I got the opportunity of learning Python Basics through Dr Chunk's Python for Every Body, Now through this course I got the hands on experience of working with Data in Python using NumPy and Pandas, ya Its awsome journey overall. Thanks Coursera and University of Michigan for bringing us such a great Learning opportunity."
1265,"Learned so much for this course. Very intensive and challenging, but also a lot of fun."
1266,very intersting course in which you can learn many thing about cleaning data etc
1267,This is the good course for learning data science
1268,very nice 
1269,"I highly recommend this course for data science beginners like me. python is such an easy language to learn and this course showed how easy it is for data cleaning , etc."
1270,"Very good course, forces to do a lot of self study."
1271,Pretty good
1272,"Sometimes need more words in tasks, so it can help understand it better."
1273,More programming details should be included. 
1274,"Dreadful course. Instructors saw no value in presenting elements of course that would help learners complete the assignments; rather you are sent off to teach yourself about uncovered techniques needed to complete the assignments. From some of the posts from previous students on GitHub, they resorted to deriving the answer from another means (Excel?) and simply providing the answer as a constant value, in order to receive credit for particular questions. Not exactly sterling knowledge transfer, from instructor to student! This course should be presented as a challenge course to people that have already learned Python Pandas from some other venue. (BTW, Pandas documentation is also dreadful, as of this writing.) This is definitely not the way to learn Python for Data Science if you are a busy professional software engineer. (Wish I had a good recommendation as an alternative.)The only positive aspect of this course is the challenge to work with defined datasets, to complete specific tasks, during week 3. (This was as much time as I could afford to allocate to this course.)From a 40+ year software engineer, with doctorate in CS, a part-time instructor at a private university, with a very challenging technology job in a multi-national corporation."
1275,"The course is a great course in terms of the knowledge and experience of the instructor and the helpfulness of the staff. I gave it 2 stars for two reasons.1) The videos are deceptively short. In MOOC instructional design, you normally design short videos because the attention span of an online learner is tends to be much shorter than an in-person university student. However, in this course, even though the video is short, it is really 5-10 times longer because they speed over the equations and teaching so fast that you have to pause and replay and rewind and replay several times while trying it yourself. So the timings are not truly accurate. If you were actually teaching it in a classroom with actual students you would go much more slowly. In this case, I wish they were more honest with the times by actually typing the code in real time while teaching. I would have preferred a lecture to make it more digestible.2) The hardest thing for me about the course was the fact that instead of practicing computational thinking within data science (decomposition, algorithmic thinking, etc.), I was really just searching on stack overflow for how to put it into python. It's poor instructional design to only teach somethings and expect students to complete assignments without giving them all the tools they will use in the assignment. It would be ok if it were an accidental mistake, but this seems to be purposeful. This happened not just in course assignments but sometimes even in mid-roll video-overlaid quizzes where the answer was something not explained or taught or shown. This was really strange to me and caused a huge amount of time to be spent searching online or trying mid-lecture problems to no avail. It cause all the timings of the course to be off (#1 caused the video timings to be severely off and #2 meant that the course assignment estimates were HUGELY miscalculated). Good instructional design would mean that the professor should show all the tools one could use to faithfully complete and achieve the assignment. For some reason that was avoided again and again in this course.Great material though. I loved learning. I just wish it were better structured and supported and that I learned more about the work rather than just searching online for how to write something."
1276,This is a good course if you have had some experience with the Pandas module in Python prior to taking the course. Pandas is a very powerful module but it has a fairly significant learning curve. There are all sorts of free Pandas tutorials available on the web. I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the basics of Pandas prior to taking this course or you will probably struggle. 
1277,"This class was super useful. I had a minimal amount of base Python under my belt and some data analysis in R, but this course really got me off the ground using the pandas data analysis library for Python and Jupyter notebooks."
1278,"Solid explanations of the basics of python and pandas. Strong emphasis on self-learning in assignments, which may be difficult for those without background in programming."
1279,"Thanks for the course. A few things that can be improved:1- The video material was very short. I expected same amount of teaching like homework, but it's more like 30 minutes versus 7 hours every week. As a result it's mostly googling and copy-pasting code, which I'm very sceptical if solving issues this way will enter my long-term memory. Probably next time I will need to look it up again. I'd prefer if the videos were the source of knowledge instead of stack overflow and the forum.2 - As an experienced programmer but being new to Python I found it difficult to load the data. I was not aware that the files are available on the server and can just be loaded by read_csv(filename.csv). Instead I tried to load the files from my local drive, which worked, but not for the grader. Then I tried to submit it offline which also failed. I wasted half a day on this. I suggest to mention quickly how the online and offline assignments work, in particular in how to load data.3 - The feedback from the grader is usually not telling much. It was often unclear to me what was the expected outcome. I think a screenshot of the expected answer for the more advanced questions (first few rows+columns) would help a lot and save us a lot of suffering. "
1280,great course for a start! at the end its all about how you practice from what you leanred
1281,"hard assignments, lecture was not enough to cover assignments."
1282,Wonderful course
1283,Amazing course. Really easy to follow along as long as you put the work in and study you'll be fine!
1284,"Unclear assignments, lectures are brief and sometimes unclear. Spent more time trying to understand what was being asked than actually learning."
1285,"Really disappointed with this course to the point I'm quiting -in spite of having paid for the grade-. It reminded me of my days at the university where I found being a great scientist/engineer didn't mean you were a great teacher. And this is the real problem, even things that should be easy to grasp are difficult to understand -just the opposite of prof. Bill Boyd who makes learning a joy-. Because of this I would only recommend this course if you already have an intermediate level in Python."
1286,Very good lecture.
1287,I really liked the course and how it introduces Python to beginners. Kudos to Coursera and University of Michigan!
1288,"Very informative introduction to Data Science using Python. Well presented and explained by the instructor. I will recommend this for python beginners and intermediate learners.I enjoyed it, hope you will too."
1289,"For me the course's biggest value-adding point is to simply ask us to Google everything on Stack Overflow to complete all the assignments, which has almost nothing to do with the course content. The assignments are also badly designed. In the discussion forum you can see lots of confused / frustrated posts. The TA's and mentors are clearly under-resourced to answer all our questions. The videos unfortunately don't teach us much either. The professor + TA's a simply reading off a teleprompter, and they're rushing through everything. I've done some amazing courses on Python also offered from Uni. of Chicago, but this course has been a big disappointment unfortunately..."
1290,This course is a joke. Contents is very very poor. And you will have a lot of problems making the Assigments.
1291,"Hope that lecture videos could be longer. Anyway, it is a great course, I really learned a lot."
1292,It was a great learning experience.
1293,The video classes are informative and very clear. The exercises during the classes were thorough and allowed me to apprehend the concepts at a good pace. My only problem were the auto-graded exams. Sometimes the questions are not crystal clear and the auto-grader isn't intelligent enough to discern between a logical mistake and some detail about table formatting. Fortunately these problems are discussed in the forums and usually one can get clues on what they can be from the mentors.
1294,"A very challenging course. The assignments are the best part of the course and it takes up a lot of time and patience to complete them. The discussion forum is fairly engaging and the mentors are very responsive. Overall, this course is a big boost in the field of Data science"
1295,"Excellent overview of the topic. Lectures are well delivered, if a bit terse. Assignments are well designed, and the mentors in the discussion forums are very helpful."
1296,The content is good
1297,Lecture content need much more coverage. 
1298,"Great course and valuable information, but frustrating autograder."
1299,Please provide more lectures. We depend on self-learning more than lectures in order to pass.
1300,Good and necessary introduction to Python. But especially Assignement 3 regarding cleaning the data should be improved. It??s good to know how to clean the data but it??s confusing when Q1 is apparently correct but actually it??s not. Mabye it would be better that Q2 - Q13 based on a new dataframe which is correctly by all means.
1301,Very well designed course for Data Science beginners
1302,"The course content is great. However, basic knowledge of python programming language is required. Since I didn't know python coding rules, I really struggled for a while. Maybe, basics of python in additional resources will help a lot of learners."
1303,cool course
1304,"I feel the videos could have been more instructive.However, the level of assignments is incredible! I learnt a lot more from programming assignments of this course than videos."
1305,I would like to have seen more detailed teaching on Hypothesis testing and how it applies to python before tackling the final project.
1306,Awesome course for those who want to kick start a data science career. 
1307,Will be useful to take the Phyton Cpurse before this one. You only learn when you do the assignments.
1308,"The Assignments are really tough and need a lot of self study. However, If you are a person who learns by doing projects this course is the one."
1309,"I learned so much. However, the lack of support when I got stuck made it a frustrating experience. I would not have been able to pass without the discussion forum tips. Even then, it was a lot of mucking in the dark and assignments took longer to complete than they should have. I'm glad I took the course but it was not designed for someone at my skill level. If the discussion forum was organized in a better way, it would have helped -- I had to scroll through pages of text to find the right tips to identify my mistakes. Sometimes the question requirements were oddly or ambiguously phrased and I misunderstood the expectation for the function being tested."
1310,really interesting course and professors are great
1311,Nice course about pandas.
1312,"Instructor gives minimal examples and says go look on stack overflow. Then he proceeds to assign problems that don't really cover what the slides, lectures, or examples were on. If I all I was trying to do was just read some docs and look on stack overflow I wouldn't need to take this course now would I?Poorly translated and cryptic instructions for assembling furniture are better than what you get here."
1313,"I really enjoyed this challenging introductory course, I cannot wait to continue the specialization"
1314,Difficult. I cannot recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people. 
1315,This course relies almost exclusively on self learning of the details of pandas. It would be greatly improved by examples of how to use pandas to solve problems similar to the assignments.
1316,"Doesn't provide resources to complete assignments.Telling students to go to Stack Overflow is a serious red flag.Independent learning is an incredibly valuable process, but this course felt more like a series of challenge assignments to do once you've learned Pandas on your own from another source."
1317,Thoroughly enjoyed. It was set at a good level ??? enough was left in the assignments so they felt like an actual accomplishment.
1318,"Great introductory course to python. Decent novice-level videos but great assignment quality. Definitely takes up more time than expected, especially if you aren't well-versed with python syntax."
1319,"requires too much self-learning,could be overwhelming to those who lack concrete python basics"
1320,"Good course, challenging as well."
1321,"Very well designed course , it compels students to go in-depth for assignment work.Very helpful Teaching staff as well"
1322,"As a python newbie, I found this course challenging yet so much fun to learn. Dr. Brooks presented the lectures in a very organized way and made them easy to follow. If you have experience in R, you probably would pick up Pandas real quick. Students are expected to devote a lot of time into the assignments and try to find the answer on your own. But with all the great tips and clarifications from our diligent mentor Sophie Greene, it's definitely achievable.Will take the other courses in this specialization and definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested in data analysis."
1323,"Learning this course gave me confidence and more interest in exploring data science, I plan to explore further through the next couple of courses."
1324,I enjoyed the way the Professor presents the concepts with real and interesting examples. The exercises during the presentation was an extra motivation. And I appreciated that each assignment was well selected with real data. The mentors and staff in the discussion 
1325,Awesome Course
1326,Excellent!
1327,"Although, i had some basic knowledge of data science before and also i did some programming in python, yet i find this course comprehensive and practical."
1328,"Felt like this course was trying to pack a lot of information into only four weeks. I find Python to be a very frustrating language - at least that's how Pandas feels. Compared to R the syntax is dreadful. And I found myself digging through help files and FAQs to find ways to do what should be the simplest things - like accessing values in a data frame. The Pandas help documents are not written for beginners, but written in a mathematically precise manner that makes them inaccessible. (Their preference for 1-letter variable names is unhelpful.) Stack Overflow is much better but it's a crap shoot as to whether somebody has addressed the exact issue that is bothering me at any given point. One final issue: it would be nice to see model solutions. I understand the difficulty in having online solutions available for an online course, but I found myself writing what I considered to be inefficient code fairly often. Would love to see slicker ways to do these tasks."
1329,Very good course
1330,Need clearer examples and explanations. Slides summing up concepts or used functions will be great.
1331,"This course is difficult. It stresses a lot of core skills in pandas and python. I wish there was more instructor support for the times that code just doesn't seem to match up with the grader's expectations. There is still a question in the course that I am relatively positive I answered correctly yet did not receive credit. Overall, the format is incredibly well done and the use of Jupyter notebooks makes the tasks very approachable. "
1332,"Great intro to data science and some of Python libraries for it.The exercises can be quite difficult, especially if you expect to have all the answers given to you during the lessons. In order to solve some of them you have to search the web to find the commands you need, which I think is a good thing because it teaches an approach useful in real scenarios."
1333,Thank you for the very elaborate and very beginner's course. The difficulty quickly ramps up and the questions within an assignment often differs substantially. This can be seen as both a pro and a con. 
1334,it is a 5 star course but I am giving it a 4 star primarily because of the pace was very very fast for me... 
1335,"Great material and presentation! Please work on question clarity, especially in the last project. With as picky as the grader is a little extra specificity would have saved me a few false starts."
1336,"Excellent pandas course. The exercises were extremely challenging, but helped me hone my pandas syntax a lot. Definitely worth the time if you're interested in becoming a business intelligence analyst or engineer."
1337,"Some topics are very difficult since many of the concepts are outside of what was thought in the lectures so one has to do a lot of research outside of the website. This takes up a lot of time and is way more than the estimated time for each part of the course. I did find excellent help available on the forum. Overall, a very challenging yet fun course."
1338,"This course is very challenging but worthwhile. Having experiences in data analysis with python, I still feel the assignments are really hard to complete. BUT it is really worthwhile, and I improved my skills in python A LOT! The auto-graded system is AWESOME! I sincerely recommend this course and really appreciate the work of the teaching staff!"
1339,"Great Course,very practical. I would improve the examples and increase the number of exercise during the lectures instead of just fastly presenting the pandas functionalities."
1340,?? ???????????????? ???????????????? ?? ???????????????? ???????????? ?? ?????????????????????????? Python.
1341,A very interesting and useful course for those who want to learn how to clean data in Python.I loved the opportunity to work directly on the notebook as I was listening to lectures.I think that more emphasis should have been put in the pros and cons why and how of using the pandas lib. functions in order to accomplish tasks.Assignments were very instructive and well explained by staff in the Discussion ForumMany thanks to the staff and to U. of Michigan for the course. 
1342,The course lessons could have been more specific and provide more explanations on many topics that are later required in the assignments
1343,Fast-paced course requiring time to finish - but totally worth it!
1344,"The whole curse relies on the automated grading system, which is still a little sloppy. I think it would be useful to have one notebook or cheatsheet with all the important functions. And also, I personally like to have a reference assignment that was completed by the instructors. This could be provided before or after the course, but the way I really learn is by reading other peoples code and seeing ways to code problems. Thanks"
1345,Fantastic course with challenging assignments. Wish there were more handouts to explain some of the key concepts and the grader was better informative of the errors.
1346,Great course!! I've enjoyed the assignments very much - from my part it required a a lot of individual investigation / reading through posts to find possible solutions but that's only fair since this is an intermediate course. It was a fantastic experience as the assignments felt like real projects. Thanks for everyone making this course possible! Daniel 
1347,The course instructor could have been more elaborate with the examples. I felt there was a wide gap between the exercises and the course material.
1348,"the knowledge touch here is really good. however, the speed is a little bit quick. I paused and go back and forth usually. the last introduction of assignment 4 is not clear. I took quite a long time to figure what to use to calculate the price ratio and what to use to run ttest."
1349,I really enjoyed this course. For me it was'n easy at all but I still say that you find the right way to help the students without make the assignments pointless. Thank you so much for this great learning opportunity!
1350,A must do course for budding data scientists
1351,Great introduction to the world of data science. Instructor does a great job of explaining the content with easy to follow examples. I highly recommend taking the course
1352,I really enjoyed the experience. The videos are precise and give examples for the materials discussed. However it feels a bit sparse on the overall length. On the other hand the exercises test the knowledge acquired through the course and self learning.
1353,the content was more focused on just pandas librarycouldve included matplotlib and scipy also
1354,Excellent introduction to data science with python. Thank you
1355,"I overthought some of the homework (the forums will tell you to not do that) and wasted much time going a bit too far cleaning data, however my own hubris aside, it was a good course. I've been working in NNs for some time, but wanted to use more formal data science tools on top of that and add something to my CV. I wish these tools had been around when I was in grad school... le sigh."
1356,"Honestly, it was a good crash course into data science in python. My 3/5 star rating comes from the fact that I think their could be more content / examples shown in the videos. The videos were a good start into the assignments, but I had to spend hours reading on the internet to really understand enough to complete the course.I liked what I saw in the videos, just wish there was a little more substance."
1357,"This python is mostly an introduction to the Python Pandas API. It teaches everything by example, but at very fast pace, and the videos are really just preparations for the assignments, which can easily take more time than specified. "
1358,right course. 
1359,"The submission tasks are too time consuming. In the other hand,forces the student to search about answers by themselves and use the techniques taught on it's full extension."
1360,"A bit short, but good info. I wish you got access to an optimal code for each of the assignments once you submit yours and pass, so you could see how you can improve."
1361,"The course was a very efficient intro to using Python to get data from various simple sources and the different structures that can be used to hold and manipulate the data. The course starts with the intuitive methods to solve problems and then introduces more complex and process friendly alternatives to demonstrate how creativity and knowledge of Python can be used to generate elegant and efficient code. The auto-grading of assignments can be a little maddening as the correct answer needs to be formatted precisely as is expected or else it will be counted as incorrect. The good thing here is that it forces you to fully understand the data types and data, the bad is it can be frustrating not knowing if the answer is wrong or just the format of the answer. Admittedly, I feel this effort forced me to become a better Python programmer."
1362,"Great course, requires much self-initiative because not all useful methods for the assignments are covered in the videos. Sometimes Assignment Questions are not described very clearly.All in all I enjoyed the course very much :)"
1363,Not for beginners. Level of difficulty increase very fast.You need to dig external reference sites and use discussion forums in order to figure out some assignments requirements.Overall quality is very good.Should have some better tips and validation scripts in order to help debugging assignments.
1364,"Very good introduction to Pandas Series and DataFrames for Data Science. Fast paced course with good supplementary materials. The homework is progressively challenging. Sophie the Teaching Assistant is particularly helpful in the forums. I don't recommend this course for those without programming or python scripting experience. Also, the homework exercises took me significantly longer than the estimates projected, but I budgeted about double the time and was able to complete the course on time."
1365,"Only 37 minutes of video, average per week. Really nice, pleasant video, but don't expect to learn how to solve the problems, because there is little connection from the problems to the videos.Teaching assistants are hard -working and knowledgable and each has a different way to do things.Very little in the way of effective educational design.But they do create useful questions to answer, if you are stubborn enough not to need actual instruction.The estimate of time required is woefully inadequate.The best thing you can do is lookup Brandon Rhodes on Youtube. He will actually explain Pandas. Expect to invest about four hours in his videos and still have questions. Use the course forum extensively ??? only there will you get a hint of how to do what they ask.Google and Stack Overflow: that's their extensive list of references."
1366,This course was really worth paying!!!Thank you for providing this course!
1367,"I found that the videos weren't entirely helpful when tackling the assignments. I had to outsource most, if not all, of my inquiries to external sources (read: stack overflow). Even simple things such as advanced indexing, such as multi-indexing, was unclear. I understand that not everything can be covered, but I feel that basic things should be. Other than that, I enjoyed using the Jupyter notebook, and thought this was integrated very nicely into the coursework."
1368,"The course was helpful in presenting typical problems in data science, but the lectures showed you examples in one area of pandas and the assignments asked questions in different areas of pandas. I found the assignments frustrating and spent much of my time trying to understand what they were asking rather than actually solving the problems."
1369,Excellent course. It really motivated me to work very hard to make all assignments on time
1370,"I enjoyed and found all of the lectures helpful, but lack of feedback after submitting assignments was a real problem, especially for the last assignment. A simple response of this was answered incorrectly, points not awarded isn't very constructive and was often frustrating. Bugs in being able to submit the assignment were also frustrating. I spent a good amount of time trying to fix my code, thinking it was incorrect, when in actuality the online submission was just not working."
1371,"The course content and assignments are pretty good at covering the fundamentals of how to manipulate data in python, I did learn a lot that I can see my self applying practically. Where it falls down though is the assignment auto-grader. It's immensely fussy (as I understand it has to be), but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don't sufficiently explicitly define whats expected. This means you spend more than 50% of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so.I would recommend this course, but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future."
1372,"An excellent course, though I think some of the assignments should be a little more guided"
1373,"From my poitn of view more lessons are needed, achieving exercises require a deep search on stackoverflow and other courses. That shouldn??t be the goal of the course, I expected the lessons to give enough knowledge to fullfil the questions of the exams"
1374,Is challenging and you learn about a bunch of different aspects of pandas. Never forget to take notes about what you are learning and review them later.
1375,It provides plenty resources and requires a lot more effort from the learners of point of view. 
1376,"Great course in hands-on experience with Python on data analytics. Before the class, I took a intro class to Python in my school covering basic commands, and thought this Coursera course would be kind of easy. But it turned out to be a very intensive one. I take more than 6 hours to complete the homework."
1377,It's a great course! The assignment is amazing! It takes me several hours or even one or two days to finish it. I have to say the assignment is really valuable. Professor Brook is also great and the video is greatly filmed. It's worth taking if you have already learned some of python and want to know more about python in data analysis. I have already learned the book Learn Python the Hard Way and played with python for a while before I take this course. 
1378,Very helpful for beginners who wants to learn Data Science with Python. Will recommend to go with this course. Thank you team for giving nice teaching. Very Grateful :)
1379,Perfect to get hands on with python programming for data science purposes.
1380,"Challenging assignments, clear and concise explanations, learned a ton!"
1381,great
1382,"This is an amazing course. The teacher (Chris) is fantastic, extremely clear and a pleasure to listen his classes."
1383,Great course. You should really work hard to pass all the assignments. Tons of practical expirience in pandas. Looking forward for the next courses.
1384,Fantastic course. Quite challenging but it is really worth for people looking to learn python and some of the key concepts in data science. I definitely will continue with the following python courses part of the specialization
1385,Good intro to Pandas and assignments are well designed
1386,Good lecturers and interactive videos 
1387,"While the course was great, the Jupyter notebooks and the background shells gave me several unnecessary errors. While this was a smaller issue, I think the practice Notebooks should be somewhat in line with the assignments. I struggles on Assignment #3. "
1388,"It is an interesting course. After taking this course, I can make use of Pandas, numpy in python. In addition, I have learned some interesting knowledge about statistic. Thanks Prof. Christopher Brooks and TAs. "
1389,"Very good class - but it does require quite a bit of outside study - reading up on stackoverflow. But after this class, the student will be able to have a very hand set of tools/skills to tackle datascience projects. BTW, python with the interactive notebook is very popular in actual datascience projects in the commercial sphere, so this class can be leveraged directly in the real world"
1390,Great introduction to Pandas.
1391,This course was fast paced but the material was interesting and not to complex. I can only recommend this course to anyone interested in Data Science and who already has a basic knowledge of Python.
1392,"The course was structured well, there were a lot of assignments that really help with learning pandas. The lectures were ok, could've been a bit longer though."
1393,Best course to learn Pandas library and some basics of Python required for Data Sciences and Machine Learning.
1394,Awesome introduction.
1395,"I took sometime to get used to the auto grader, but after that it's fine. All the staffs are very helpful in clarifying the questions and provide code to debug my codes. It was awesome!"
1396,"Really amazing course, I leaned a lot about pandas, how to manage and clean data and extract value out of that. I've learned a little about statistics, specially hypothesis testing."
1397,Very good and practical course. Challenging and enjoyable assessments. Thank you very much indeed. 
1398,"The course is fast paced and the videos do not cover all of what is necessary to know to pass the assignments. However, this is not a problem as all the necessary references are given. The problem is the way the programming assignments are designed and the automatic grader, which should definitely be improved. Some times you spend hours to figure out what is wrong and you finally find out that you have a precision error because of using a library function instead of another (same purpose) or you spend our to manipulate a Pandas dataframe to respond to the specifications, except that all that time is wasted as the grader will accept the first version even if the index does not respond to the requirement (for instance). So, if you want to take it, prepare to fight with the grader. Positive point: Excellent help on the forums, you will not be left alone. "
1399,"The course is very good and very demanding. But the assignments estimation time were, for me, really completely out. I used much more than 3 more times the suggested ones."
1400,The course's content is great but the fact that we have to search by our self's for the tests was the best for me.
1401,"Great Course! I learn a lot about Python, Pandas and other areas. Looking forward to taking the next courses."
1402,Nice course. I really liked how I could proceed at my own pace. The computer-graded assignments were very helpful and the Forums were good sources of info.
1403,"This course has greatly helped my understanding of not only some python, but pandas as well. My only suggestion to anyone that wants to take this course is to make sure to allocate as much time as possible to it. They give estimates as to how long it should take you to complete a week's worth of material, but this can vary highly from person to person. Overall, I enjoyed!"
1404,"I do have background in OOP programming but not Python. But I do also programming in MATLAB. I chose this course to learn more about technical skills to do research in data mining, data science, and machine learning. The instructor is fine but the lecture note is not really helpful. Students need more clear written information than just lecturing in Video as referring to lecture notes as needed would be more efficient. Each week assigns one programming assignment consisting of multiple problems. I don't think the shown expected time to complete each assignment is totally unrealistic. It took tremendous time to complete and at least to pass it. One good thing is that as far as you complete it within the session, there is no penalty and you can get the passing scores. However, all the programming is graded by the autograder which has a lot of bugs. For example, the exactly same solutions that was passed by the autograder as correct previously are graded as incorrect in the next trial. The staff people try to help but I totally don't understand their approach in that 'this may help but I am not sure if the autograder can accept it'. I believe they try to fix the bugs and use the 'trustworthy' autograder so students can rely on the feedback provided the autograder. We are not learning how to make the autograder not generate errors. I believe many of students are taking this course to improve their career performance. In my case, I am working as a full-time while I am taking this course. Due to the lack of time and the inefficient/faulty autograder, I took a lot of my precious time. I got passed this course with 95 and will continue taking the rest of the courses in this specialization because I already paid the whole specialization package and supported by my company. But I believe the staff team should improve the technical aspects so students can save a lot of their time. Also many of the programming problems do not have the sufficient level of clarity. For each problem, there should be an example so students do not have to spend too much time to understand or guess the solution. I found many inconsistency in the solutions although I guessed it by spending a lot of time to pass this course."
1405,"Challenging, awesome. Working through the assignments will really teach you Pandas, which makes Python scripts much more efficient. I'm already using the things I have learned at work."
1406,"Course lectures were good, tho at times a little too rapid. The python text appears and disappears too fast to digest, I did a lot of pausing. The early exercises were good, but later ones were finicky. I would prefer more intermediate steps to confirm we're on the right track. In particular the last (huge) exercise was frustrating, just being told I've got it wrong with no feedback on why. "
1407,"This course would be great if you are experienced in Python or any other programming language. The title ' Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required.' is very misleading and if you do not have any experience, you will struggle a lot especially to complete week 3 &amp; 4 assignments. It makes you think and requires a lot of self-study, which is a good way to enhance our knowledge and skills, however assignments are way too challenging for those who are 'beginners' or have little real-world experience. I would not recommend if you do not have much confidence in your programming 'experience'.Having said that, teaching team is great - very knowledgeable and supportive. "
1408,I would recommend the coursera online training session need more improvement. Please look at this youtube video. this will give you some fair idea what do i mean. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0AWyzVMf54During the session speaker need to be visible on top corner and they need to present with more examples during learning this will help and learn fast. I struggled a bit following your videos going back-and-forth with the given materials.I also struggled solving the assignment due to confusing questions. Not much clear what is required to solve the problem. it would be helpful to provide some hints for each assignment. 
1409,"Assignment 3 was absolutely ridiculous in the sense that the implementation of pandas functions depended on data cleaning in the first step for which there was no help . No response from peers or moderators on my queries. Had high hopes when I joined the course. I feel cheated now. Because of some issues with the data cleaning step, all my following answers were incorrect and I couldn't pass the course in time."
1410,Fantastic overview and support 
1411,"Overall this was a great class. The programming assignments were the most valuable part of the course for me and were good practice for wrangling data with pandas. I did find some of the assignments asked questions in a way that were confusing and it was difficult to debug the answer based on the automatic grader. However, I'm looking forward to when the rest of the specialization is available, as this looks like a good track!"
1412,Very Useful and practical
1413,"The course is very good to introduce people with pandas usage, however, the autograder and little data issues on the assignments costs a lot of learning time."
1414,"In my humble opinion, the Python ramp-up in week 1 is not sufficient to effectively complete weeks 2-4. This course necessitates a bit more practice in Python. The lectures are cut-and-dry, and I recommend frequently referencing them when completing the assignments. I spent about 1.5x the listed time-to-complete on most assignments. On the flip side, I gained a lot of knowledge by putting forth full effort."
1415,Very good content. Challenging assignment that force you to learn more yourself rather than just apply what you've heard and forget it in 10 minutes. 
1416,Please make longer tutorial videos. Sometimes it becomes too fast to cope up with.
1417,great course!!
1418,"The course is great and learned a lot from the assignment! I just feel some of the content is a little beyond me since it took a lot of time to finish. After finishing the assignment, I feel myself haven't done enough! So if possible, I hope more exercise can be posted here :)"
1419,Nice course for understanding the basics
1420,"Course is very self-directed. There are very few exercises, and there is minimal feedback on those exercises. No attempt is made to reinforce learned knowledge over time (e.g. spaced repetition) nor is there any definitive list for what knowledge should be gleaned from this course. Emphasis is placed on the student's teaching themselves and learning through experience with no attempt to actually understand the learning process or rest the course design on a scientific basis. Standard filler course for an empty education system."
1421,Overall a very nice introduction to Python. Sometimes the checks for the assignments were a little annoying. It would be way easier if all the checks would be published from the outset.
1422,"Congratulations, folks! This course is amazing! I learned *a lot* on it! =]"
1423,Excellent material.
1424,Course is good. I learned a lot. But the pace of teaching is very fast.
1425,Assignment time estimations were way off in my opinion.
1426,Thank you once again Courser and Team for their generous contribution towards students across globe. The teachers and courses mentors specially Sophie who was awesome during the assignment for her nice clarification. This course was challenging but fun. 
1427,"Overall, this course is tough for me. In my opinion, the course title is not suitable, which is introduction. The word introduction generally means something basic and fundamental. However, the level programming assignments in this course is between slightly medium and very hard. Furthermore, the assignment instructions are not clear enough, i.e. what steps need to be followed to complete each question. So, it needs time for me to find the way or solution in the discussion forum. I know in each week forum, there is one discussion specifically for assignment (i.e. Assignment X Tips), which is good. But, I think the forum is not a good place, since we have to find it meticulously the information and what we want to find is spread out, not in an easy to follow order.Moreover, I do not think the lectures and the assignments are well synchronized as there are many things in assignments that are outside from the lectures. I mean, it is too many new things in the assignment. Although it is a great way for the students to search and enhance their skills by themselves, in general, the assignments should at least reflect the lectures.Lastly, in my humble opinion, this course is not appropriate for someone who is new to programming and has not been familiar or mastered any programming languages, though the title is introduction."
1428,Don't think this should be classified as Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required. Need at least some coding experience. 
1429,"Very well structured course. I would really appreciate if there are more video lectures. For someone like who is not from CS background, self-study topics can get really difficult.Apart from that loved it."
1430,Great course for beginner in data science
1431,"please provide the complete 5 unit details . I could see only this unit is open for past many months. I paid for all 5 unit money already and not in a position revert back and get the money. Could you please help me out to understand when this courses will be available if not in near future , why are they taken money before the course is not ready to us. Quite disappointing experience."
1432,Hard to do
1433,"Very rewarding course. As many others have mentioned, the learning curve in the assignments is steep and the time estimate of 4 hours/week is unrealistically short. It took me about three days of full-time work to finish the course. Great into to working with data structures in pandas, data cleaning and basic statistical tests in python."
1434,Was good but the support in the forums could be better.
1435,"Basically assignments were unclear (I had to do lots of resubmissions), but everything else was fine."
1436,Very interesting subject and data science skills are definitely currently in demand. The only thing that bugged me was that the grader didn't give much feedback on anything you did wrong. On the flip side the mentors did a GREAT job (kudos to you guys). The discussion forums were vital and they were really well moderated. 
1437,"Nice course! there is only one suggestion I want to send you, the video is so short that we can not learn the pandas more in the course. So I hope you can provide more detailed videos thanks. "
1438,"This is very helpful course, my skills horned after undergoing through this sessions. My expertise and style of using python for data analysis changed. Articles and group discussions about P-hacking made me to realize the pitfalls, I may enter once I get addicted to proving my hypothesis correct. I got an idea, what better I can understand; when data speaks. I am waiting for next module of this course. Please start it as possible."
1439,"This course taught ma Pandas and Hypothesis test, which are very useful in my study and future work. For example, I learned how to sort values, merge tables, and reset indexes. And most parts is like SQL.Lectures will give some basic knowledge of the contents for each week. And this course also provide enough related documents, including codes and slides in classes. And it also has subtitle, which helps me a lot for my understanding.When I was doing assignment, I still need to search more information from internet and learn by myself. I think this is a great way to help me know how to solve problems by myself. I think it is also a little bit challenging for a beginner, so I suggest beginner to learn some basic knowledge before taking this course. "
1440,Perfect courses! With a lot of opportunities to practice and to learn from do questions by yourself. Mentors and staffs are also kindly to answer problems. 
1441,"Good introduction of working with tabular data in Pandas dataframes. I've learnt how to access columns, rows, and specific values in a dataframe. How to transform the data. And how to merge dataframes together. The assignments are a lot of do-it-yourself by reading documentation and Q&amp;A sites. So you're forced to read a lot, and learn more than actually necessary. Teacher and mentors gave hints on the discussion forum which helped. Could have been better if part of the solution is given. E.g. answer = 0.0073.........64 without actually giving the full answer. I also think the automatic grader should give an explanation or example of a correct answer when the assignment is answered correctly. It would have been better that way, because I could review the strengths and weaknesses of the methods I used to get to the answer. "
1442,Really good introductory course to Pandas. Teaching stuff was a big help and forums are very active and informative. Very good work. Area of improvement: The estimated timings of completion are too optimistic :)
1443,The duration of the course (4 weeks) was ideal. It was manageable as a part time course. The tests helped me a lot to practice and learn the concepts deeply. The forums were very helpful in clarifying the questions. The video quality was great.Many thanks for this great course which is made available online for free for all the world.
1444,Helpful
1445,This course will be a great start for people to know about data science with python and get familiar with few simple data.
1446,"I certainly learnt a lot through this course. The hands on oriented approach of this course works wonders for those who intend to dig deeper and improve their Python programming. The lectures are crisp and clear, but the main learning happens while doing the weekly assignments. Each assignment forces us to go search for content beyond what has been taught in the lectures and in this process we find new things. Also, the lecturer informed us about some good reference books for individual learning. I look forward to taking part two of this course. The mentors in the discussions forum are quite active and helpful. The forum was of big help to me for clearing the assignments. The only flaw I found was that the autograder does not clearly define our mistakes and that's where the mentors come in and explain in the discussion forum. This part could be better automated. Finally, I believe that a prior introduction to Python programming is an essential prerequisite to this course."
1447,The assignments were challenging and cool. Lot of self-study needed to crack them. The lecture videos could have been a bit more interesting.
1448,"I have struggled a lot during this course to complete the assignments. It is hard, it is well taught and you learn a lot!"
1449,"The lecturer is excellent, the forums are active and useful and the exercises are a good mixture of challenging and enjoyable. A very good course overall."
1450,The course material is very short and precise. Previous knowledge of Python is helpful. This course serves its purpose as an introduction to Python libraries and how they are used in the field of Data Science. 
1451,"Too much focus on databases and database operations, rather than data science.The assignments are too difficult for a 4 week course."
1452,This course was over all okay. My primary complaints are that I felt that the class moved too quickly and relied too heavily on students to teach themselves through the Pandas documentation. The Pandas documentation is really only so-so and it would have been nice to have more guidance through the course materials.
1453,"Very nice Course, You will Learn about how to effectively use Pandas Library for Python and how to treat DataFrames in that ambient, there are nice functions and methods for parsing. The Course is very fast pace, I only have time on the weekends (some of those), so I had to switch dates two times. Also, some materials are very fast, so If you are new in Python, got to be sure if you have mastered prior concepts of the course (Week 2 depends on week 1 and so on ...). A large part of the course involves your own research in Python Docs and StackOverFlow page. As I am an R user, some things are intuitive (and maybe more easier for me to do in R), several of the things in comparison I thought: Wow, but this is so much easier on R, but at other times I saw the power of Python for parsing tasks or webdata that in the R require too much memory or are more complicated to obtain. R have the problem to treat everything like an object and guided by vectors, but at some parts that makes understand coding details more deeply, at least for me. I still think that the documentation of R the best there is for my purposes, so I will stick with that, but it's great to know how to develop some things in Python, mainly because of my goal of getting some applications to end users. Finally, not much related to the course, but maybe with the change in the platform of the Coursera, the forums seemed a little more confusing and a little more slower than former courses that I took, I think it might have to do with the same course running in parallel on different dates."
1454,"The course content is great - Prof Christopher seriously made justice to the content. He is great instructor. He has presented course in right manner, with right speed. Looking for more courses from Him. "
1455,"I learnt a lot, and enjoyed the process! It was more engaging than I expected of an online course. Excited to go forward with the specialization."
1456,"All the ingredients are there, but it would be nice to have more hand-holding given the ramp-up in difficulty in only a few weeks."
1457,It was very hard but extremly learnful.
1458,One of the best Courses I have done online. Took me back to basics and gave the best possible introduction to python which was beyond my expectations
1459,"Excellent course and lot to learn, one of the best data analysis toolkit available."
1460,"The course lectures were subpar and didn't cover the material in the assignments. Googling for answers and checking stackoverflow for code is a great way to get tips, but it doesn't teach you the core material. I would have rather had links to supplemental readings that the materials were based on. I would not recommend this course as an introduction course unless you've had significant experience with Python data structures and know how to work with lists, dataframes, and iterate over those. "
1461,Thanks a lot for your work. It's a great course for data sciense in python!
1462,"A lot of the harder questions were unclear or not covered by the course. Many were passed onto look this up yourself, which is fine, but sometimes a different approach resulted in a slightly different answer marked as wrong. The group_by stuff was especially tricky, as it was unlike its SQL counterpart and could have used a better example, eg with a function to split into quarters or group columns. Other than that, very interesting overall and very neat datasets. I would encourage having students check out kaggle.com for extra credit."
1463,"Really good course with challenging assignments. However, the grader has some issues, for every assignment I had to spend more time trying to figure out how to make the grader accept my answers than actually solving the problems."
1464,The assignments were very well made and the discussion forums were also very well moderated. I will highly recommend this to any of my peers who are interested.
1465,The material seemed a bit hurried at times..but overall a great learning experience and the assignments were truly helpful
1466,Great Course!
1467,"Two stars because I have found poor explanations of assignments. I finished the course without being very clear what I was asked, and I lacked more feedback when one of the tasks is wrong. The teacher and the videos are very good."
1468,Excellent course in one word
1469,"Good course, if a bit fast paced, expect a great deal of searching through documentation and stackoverflow, but it is to be expected from an intermediate level course."
1470,I never thought this Data Science course was going to be that challenging and exciting at the same time. I have really enjoyed this first course and I am about to enroll for the coming courses. Well explained concepts and very comprehensive videos. Congrats!
1471,Looks like it's prealpha version of what it might be.
1472,"Advanced Python! It was hard, but I enjoyed it! "
1473,Excellent to get started with data science with Python. Very good instructor and lots of hands on exercises. Kudos!
1474,"This course was great to get a start in Data Science. I thought the lectures and the course notes were very well presented and served as a good resource for the assignments. The use of Jupyter notebooks was especially helpful. I found the course forums also very helpful in debugging my code. I have some previous experience with Pythons so the level of the assignments was easy enough that I didn't feel overwhelmed, but challenging enough for me do a lot of independent study. A criticism I have is that the Jupyter notebooks kept logging me off so saving assignments regularly failed and I had to redo work often. I usually don't pay for courses on Coursera, but the quality of this was so good that I will definitely continue with the specialization. "
1475,"Com certeza o curso melhorou o meu conhecimento em python. Antes mesmo de termin??-lo j?? aplicava os conhecimentos no meu trabalho. Contudo, terminei trabalhando muito mais tempo nas provas do que o tempo estipulado pela equipe de instrutores. Cheguei a pensar que estava fazendo tudo errado, mas vi nos f??runs que outros tamb??m tiveram a mesma dificuldade. Estou muito satisfeito, n??o quero provas mais f??ceis, apenas uma no????o mais adequada do tempo que ser?? gasto (levando em conta que estrangeiros podem demorar mais para entender o enunciado)."
1476,"Last assignment was *painful*: Poorly described instructions, outcomes/outpu; the grader was opaque and largely mute."
1477,"good when it's been around for a while, else frustrated with a lot of unclear instruction and no support."
1478,It needs some previous experience with Python and if possible with Pandas
1479,Um ??timo curso para quem quer iniciar um aprendizado em Python e em Data Sciente.
1480,"It's great course, but the assignments are so hard to data science beginner."
1481,the homework is interesting
1482,Briskly paced course for those new to Python and/or Pandas. Good weekly exercises that ended with a real life data analysis exercise in week 4.
1483,Thanks for introducing Pandas and Anaconda!
1484,The course is well structured and clarity of teaching is impressive. The assignments have a good mix of easy and progressively tougher questions that build on the syllabus and challenge you to manipulate data in your own way. I can warmly recommend this course to anyone who wants to begin manipulating and analysing data using python. 
1485,"I learned good materials for Python from this class. The assignments are good. Only one comment: the writing of the assignments can be very vague and at times it is hard to understand. Overall, I like the class. "
1486,"Hard course, but good ROI."
1487,"While this was one of the better courses I've done on Coursera, the start date of the course was changed without any indication of when it would begin. We've also been waiting months for the next course in the specialisation to begin, again without any communication. This was a good course, but I would recommend people wait until all the rest of the courses are available before starting this course and beginning the specialisation."
1488,"This is a very well organized course with a great introduction to data science. In a short time of 4 weeks, it covers Python basics, Padans library, and some very basic introduction to statistics in data science. The assignments are well desgined, and the mentors are very helpful in the forums. I highly recommend this course. "
1489,"It was challenging yet fun to learn this course. Last but not least, the http://stackoverflow.com is really helpful. I highly recommend it to anyone who want to learn Python."
1490,This course has helped me equip basics knowledge of Python Pandas.
1491,Good at setting up the framework for the assignments. Google/stackoverflow is your friend. The course materials presents the information but you will have to go and actively learn a good amount of material. I enjoyed this approach but some may be looking for a more contained course. 
1492,"a little more help from the video lectures is expected. The assignments required a lot of self study which is great but at the beginning, every assignment looks daunting and discourages a little. Although the forums helped a lot in getting through this course, but the majority of the roadmap to take, and all other lessons should be included in the videos."
1493,First two weeks are great. The third week becomes a bit disporportionately difficult. The autograder is very inflexible. 
1494,very practical and efficient - high useful skills gained per time spent ratio!
1495,"Useful and concise lectures, interesting exercises!"
1496,"Although I learned a lot in this course, I found the lectures and assignments to be much too different from each other. I would like to see assignments where you must practice what is learned in the lecture. For myself, I feel I learned 1 set of concepts from the lectures and another set from the assignments by spending time on stack overflow and the pandas documentation. Both are good but the lectures and assignments did not flow together as I would have liked."
1497,The instructor was great . The assignments were good and helped me learn a lot.
1498,"It is a great, brief introduction to Pandas. I think it is ideal for someone who already knows Python but doesn't have much experience with Pandas. Lectures are well structured with quizzes interspersed. Homework assignments are also well structured and use real data."
1499,Very good course with lots of hands on experience. Jupyter Notebooks are very good learning tool. 
1500,"This was overall an excellent course, I very much appreciate everyone who has made this happen. However, the very last question of the very last assignment I found to be substantially more difficult than everything else, by a very large degree. Because of that one question I ended up moving my session twice and nearly dropped the course. https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/discussions/weeks/4/threads/1Fkg-ryCEeaIRw7T1E5tHA/replies/vK-NSNNOEeaBeg5U4yHl7A is what finally got me over the hump. The instructions were not very clear to me but the price ratio calculation was the key to success. My guess is that missed it somewhere. Anyway, thanks! I will be moving on to the next course."
1501,"I can see a couple of problems in this course. How to access and change elements in a data frame (especially the use of loc and iloc) is not explained very well and I believe there is an error in the slides. The second thing is that I have found more powerful methods in pandas documentation, for example assign() or nlargest() and nsmallest(). This is not really a problem if one of the hidden purposes is to push students to actively search the docs for what they would like to do.Work load for the assignments is just fine in my opinion, not too little, not too much.Overall I am satisfied. "
1502,"While the material is undoubtedly useful, te structure of the assessments is not very helpful. For example, in week 3 we are asked to create data frames from input files: these are presented in descending order of complexity for cleanup. Furthermore, the points for most of the questions are 6.66, despite what are very different demands fore each part. In the final week, the dictionary of state names is counterproductive in answering part one (some state names are region names) and one can either get 100% or one fails the course (as one question is worth 50% of the grade.) Some of the autograder feedback is so terse as to be downright infuriating. Add to that frequent issues with the notebook crashing and much of this coursework was an exercise in unnecessary frustration rather than increasing enlightenment. "
1503,Great hands on course!
1504,I learned in this course that pandas is a way deeper rabbit hole than it appears on the surface. However rather than teaching me pandas this course mostly just helped me verify that I was learning pandas. The questions in this class need more scaffolding. I ended up skipping most of the in-video questions because I felt that the work I was investing in getting them correct was not teaching me much. More scaffolding could fix this. 
1505,Tough course if you are new to Python and do not like to browse stackoverflow. Otherwise a great course with challenging assignments.
1506,It is not easy for me to complete this course but I learned A LOT! It is truly beneficial if you don't give up. Yes you need to search a lot of python skills online to complete the programming assignment. 
1507,"I'm an experienced data analytics professional re-skilling after being laid off. I really enjoyed this course. Professor Brooks' lectures were engaging and clear. I found the assignments to be great practice, although they were challenging for my level of programming experience.I strongly recommend having some skill with python, particularly pandas, prior to taking this course."
1508,"Excellent class, well-designed programming exercises with autograding."
1509,Finding optimal solutions for the assignments would have helped more
1510,"Skills acquired when finishing this first course are very useful and applicable. However, lectures and assignments are almost unrelated. This course is nothing for people who are new to python. "
1511,"The content and the instruction were great: just the right level for someone like me with experience in other programming languages a decent familiarity with stats.There were a few glitches with the auto-grader for the assignments, but nothing to onerous."
1512,"I found this course useful since I had no previous experience of Pandas or the statistical features of Python. I have programming experience and feel I would have found it quite a challenge otherwise, but not prohibitively so. Chris is great at explaining things in an accessible manner, and I'm very much looking forward to going into more detail in the rest of the specialisation. I would have enjoyed a little more focus on statistics etc and a little less on the mechanics of the library, but understand why it had to be approached this way."
1513,"This is the best ever of all courses I took on MOOC. It was well prepared, Clear, fast paced, informational, challenging, and with appropriate exercises. Sometime I had to pool my hair to get things done and spent a lot of time, but it was fun and worthwhile. I thank Christopher Brooks and the team. I"
1514,very tough to catch up.
1515,Very nice introduction to pandas for those who already know how to program.
1516,"Excellent course. As someone that knows R and is trying to learn Python, I found it to be just what I was looking for."
1517,This would be the best course I have in this platform. Videos and readings are very brief but homework are fantastic!
1518,"This was a very helpful course in getting comfortable with using the pandas library and different concepts in numpy in data analysis. The fact that the instructors and course materials do not give you 100% of the tools to complete the assignments is a plus. Every data analyst and programmer inevitably will have to rely on self-guidance. This course by itself may not be immensely useful in the professional world, but lays a strong foundation for the student to focus more on plotting, analysis, and conceptual learning, rather than on code."
1519,Great course. Challenging homework.
1520,"I have learned an amazing amount about Pandas and how powerful it is for Data Science, Thanks Peter"
1521,An excellent introduction to data science using python
1522,"I liked that the course was very assignment-oriented. It had a good structure and interesting additional readings. However, for people who are not familiar with pandas library it may be very challenging to pass assignments. This minimal guidance, I believe, results not in a better understanding, but in confused students writing bad code and spending hours not understanding online documentation. Overall, I really liked the idea and content of the course, but not how instructors approached the self-learning part."
1523,Great introduction to pandas and the basics of data cleaning and preparation. The video lectures are great and the optional readings are interesting. I had a blast working on the assignments and learned quite a bit. I would recommend this as a good starting point to anyone looking to learn how to use python for data analysis purposes!
1524,"Great for someone with intermediate experience in Python. A quick way to learn the pandas package, and apply it to interesting examples. A big thank you to the instructors!"
1525,Very informative and helpful!
1526,Very nice course. Professor explains clearly. Materials are complete and not difficult to understand.
1527,"I felt like the test-candidate for a new course. While the course-work and the presentations itsself were excellent, the homework was a real pain as very often the Auto-grader didn't work and it took me hours to get a project which was correct, to be accepted as the right solution. Cannot recommend it to be honest unless they improve their systems. Also it was said that the other course specialization start soon but it seems they don't and I paid for the full package...."
1528,The instructor should lower the speed
1529,"The course is challenging, and designed to encourage learners to be independent and make full use of the discussion forum. As long as learners do not lose sight of the fact that help is available, they will enjoy this course. But if they lose faith, this would be a disaster. "
1530,"I really like Prof. Brooks's way of teaching. He developed a very good introductory level course. Apart from some talks about data science in a whole, he concentrated on the preparatory work in this field -- data cleaning. Instead of delving into theories, he paid most of his attention to how to make things work by using python. I actually have a background in C, and I was a bit reluctant to learn python at first since C is already strong enough to attack most tasks. However, I have fallen in love with python now, and I think it is a much more suitable language for daily use especially when your projects aren't very large. Among its many merits, the best thing about python is of course its numerous libraries like numpy and pandas which free us from tedious low-level programming. I am quite convinced that I will move to python from now on.In addition to lectures, I truly recommend you go over extra reading materials. Those articles are very thought provoking. For example, the first one 50 Years of Data Science totally changed my previous view towards this field. It made me realize that data science is not a simple combination of statistics and machine learning, that it is a distinct way of obtaining new knowledge, and that its advancement shall benefit the whole science society.About the assignments, those taught in the lecture are not enough and you should refer to python documents and stack overflow. I think knowing how to solve problems and where to find help is more important than solving problems itself, and that's why I consider those assignments well designed.Finally, thanks to all the efforts made by the teaching staff."
1531,"Videos are fast-paced, material is limited (no real slides or extensive doc). Exercises are sometimes not clear in their statement. Activity on the forum compensates that. Exercises are however close to challenges you face in real life. Finally, the start date was delayed and there is no clear visibility on when the other modules are started. So, the course could be better given, provide more material and be better coordinated. I followed one Python course at Rice University which was by far better given. "
1532,Very nice course with good demonstration and practical assignments.
1533,Better course for Beginners. 
1534,The best course for beginners like me. The way Professor teaches is awesome.
1535,"In general, this course is able to introduce the basics of data manipulation in pandas. Exercises are designed in a way that key python functions can be applied. The downside is, I feel like the grading some what less intuitive. For example, in may assignments, student has to import pandas or numpy in each and every function in order to get the score. Another problem when submitting your assignment is that students have to SAVE changes in order for the new code to take effect. Last but not least, the reading of the grading report is unclear. Students may not get the full reason for certain errors, thus creating challenges to improve their homework. "
1536,Requires most projects to be completed without the videos help. Need to research and find answers elsewhere. Also need to have good sense of python. 
1537,Great basic introduction to the pandas library and data science concepts
1538,It is a very good course for learning pandas.
1539,"Very helpful introduction to pandas. I can already think of several applications. The Jupyter notebooks accompanying the lectures were very helpful. The assignments were well thought out, and the TA posted some helpful commentary to resolve some ambiguity in the instructions."
1540,"The assignments were tough and they really tested your knowledge of python. That being said, the lectures were absolutely useless. I spent 90% of my time trying to figure out python through stack overflow. The jupyter platform is also very frustrating. For whatever reason, error messages kept coming up as I was trying to complete the assignments. At one point, I lost all my work because of this error. "
1541,It was a good course where i learned about new and great tools and techniques. I learned how to approach the data science problems using Pandas and Numpy. This would not serve as a great course for into to data science. Background with Database Management and Python really helps. Overall i learn about new and great tools and would definitely require Documentation while using the skills i learnt in this course. Overall Great Job by Professor Brooks. Would love to take more courses by him.
1542,Really good course. Provides ample time to figure out things. Does not penalize for slightly late submissions which is good for busy people. Teaches the fundamentals and asks tougher questions in assignments. Does not spoon feed the answers.
1543,"Classes moved very fast, especially in the video materials. Functions were introduced briefly without time to digest. While I ultimately did learn the topics through my own research, I feel the class would have been much more beneficial with slower, more indepth explanations."
1544,"Content is actually very good, I can feel the content creator and staffs emphasis on real world problems. Projects and Assignments are quite useful, and I can expect to use skills I acquired in my day to day work. However, the most agonizing parts of this course is it requires tremendous of time to do self-study. I spend tons of time on google search, reading docs and go over other people's post on various forums in order to find the right way(sometimes optimal way) to finish the assignments. I understand and accept that self-study is very import to master things nowadays, but I really think gap is too big between what was taught in class and what you need to complete this course, especially for people that has zero data science programming experience like me. I'd rather spend time watching 2 more hours of teaching videos per week that can cover more aspects/topics/tips/tricks than go over lots of docs and posts. I won't deny I learned a lot through this course, but I believe my learning curve can be flatten significantly if there is more class materials available. If the majority of course is spent on googling, what's the point to take it?"
1545,very practical introduction to Python programming
1546,"The course is fantastic! By practicing with the assignments, I improved a lot in python programming. I am now confident in doing data cleaning and manipulation in python."
1547,Fantastic!
1548,I am an engineer and I use matlab and stata for data analysis and currently taking Machine Learning course by Stanford which is fabulous. I did not like this course for the following reasons: 1- bad course design structure 2- so confusing and inappropriate sequence3- super fast without providing any intuition 4- no fundamental explanation 5- course could be longer and spend enough time in each subject 
1549,A pretty challenging course! I learned a lot and would recommend to anyone interested in advanced python and data science.
1550,"Many bugs, lecture content does not cover topics required to complete the assignments, assignment instructions are not written in a clear way."
1551,Great course and material.
1552,Good hands on projects.
1553,"Great Course, excellent exercises. "
1554,"Very well prepared course, good quality video and audio too (some of the older courses have crappy audio)... this class gives you enough information to allow you to research and attack new problems on your own"
1555,"Great course for data preparation for ML which is sometimes neglected in other courses. Great instructor. Useful assignments. Assignments require research on your own which is good. I would recommend to maybe make the course longer and cover more topics (in-depth string processing etc.), because it felt a bit short. Thanks Dr. Brooks for putting this together."
1556,Excellent course. Good classes and the assignment push you to go further!
1557,"A lot of knowledge, sometimes too dense. Treats you like an adult and encourages you to look on your own. Very useful."
1558,good solid intro to python munging. 
1559,This course was a good introduction to using Python for data science. I found the coverage of Pandas to be especially beneficial. 
1560,"Great course, it would be nice to have more interaction and feedback from TA's."
1561,"This is a great course with excellent materials and very practical assignments. The course forum is more than supportive, I won't be able to complete this without helps from my peers and all the teaching staff."
1562,It's really nice to learn pandas in this courses. Every assignment is full of challenge for me.
1563,"The course is quite demanding from the get go. If you are trying to get by with casual interest, then this is not the course for you. Much of my December vacation (which I had earmarked for playing video games) was spent coding on this course. The biggest gripe I have about the course is the grader system. It gives a binary output indicating whether you got the question right or wrong. Unfortunately, often that is not good enough, to debug your code. I spent hours figuring out what's going on. The forums were also not helpful, since there were not many taking the course.At the end of all this, if I ask myself, did I learn a lot? The answer is probably no. However, I did get a lot of coding experience. Debugging experience. We have many databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc), which have far more powerful features than what pandas can do. Therefore, as a system designer, it is unclear to me as to why I would ever pick Pandas over the rest. It appears quite slow (compared to the likes of time tested databases). It offers very few features (when compared to a DB). Lastly, I can use it only with Python. To me, it appears to be a no-brainer to use any one of those DBs to store, modify and massage my data. Maybe there are valid applications that can make use of Pandas like features, but I did not learn that from the courseSummary:Better Motivation to use Pandas over standard DatabasesBetter grader design. "
1564,"To be an introductory course I struggled a lot, is a very practical course, and the assignements encourage you to learn more. This is the best technical course I have taken. Lo recomiendo ampliamente"
1565,"Excellent course for data analysis in python, although the assignments are quite challenging and time consuming for beginners. During the course, I wish I could access to the correct codes after passing minimum score so that I could compare what I did with what common practices would be. We all code in different ways to achieve the same outcome, but it would be nice to know the most efficient ways/styles. "
1566,Very condensed and practical. Good fit for the ones who already have some experience in DS using other tools (like R).
1567,"In my humble opinion, this course does not have a correct balance of difficulty of new concepts/tools with the exercises given by the course to practice. It is a hey, look, there is something called pandas out there that may be very useful for you but it is too introductory. And I know the course has the word Introduction in the title but that does not grant, in my opinion, to run a 4-week course such as this one with so little content "
1568,"As compared to some other machine learning/data science courses offered Introduction to Data Science in Python was very pragmatic. Starting out with simple data cleaning and data structuring may not be the most exciting thing ever, but it was extremely useful to learn the basic tools needed to be a competent data scientist. One point of warning - the homework and projects took me about twice a long as suggested by the course notes. "
1569,Very interesting and fun
1570,"Positive aspects:Readings were relevant and interesting.I learned a lot.I was challenged.Negative aspects:Programming assignments took SIGNIFICANTLY longer than suggested (I have 20+ years of programming experience and am fluent in 3 programming languages, but I'm new to Python).Course did not provide enough support to learners. You're on your own to learn the material and you won't get timely responses (if any) from the staff. I asked clarifying questions about lecture material on the Discussion Forums and got no response (twice).Several concepts were not taught with appropriate detail / explanation. For example, there was no instruction on how to read error messages in Python."
1571,Nice lecture. Needs to have more videos and more advanced tutorials
1572,"Course material is interesting and modern, but its amount might be bigger - current level is not enough to complete all the assignments."
1573,i loved the course!. This was my first experience on Data Science and I really liked the approach to the subject.
1574,course was good but teaching material was not enough to complete the assignment
1575,Awesome Course......
1576,"Quite a fast-paced course, with very quick and packed lectures. Would have preferred the course to be slightly longer e.g. 6 weeks and covering more content. I actually found the style of the coursework to be a plus - though it involved a lot of Googling, this is more reflective of real life, where answers aren't just handed to you on a plate. However, the instructions for the assignments aren't very clear in places, which can easily cause you to become stuck."
1577,To much disconnect between assignments and lectures
1578,"It is a tough class for me, I read over three times, I feel good to pass the assignment."
1579,Thank you very much for this course. I really enjoyed the level of the course. In particular the fact that a decent amount of research was needed to work on the assignment. A few issues with the programming assignment. Especially at the beginning. I am assuming this is because this is the first version that uses jupyter notebooks. 
1580,Very comprehensive in terms of the amount of material covered and the content covered in the material. Covers a lot of model building algorithms in addition to machine learning fundamentals. Has an intuition lecture in addition to the fundamentals which helps a lot! A possible change could be to use R to demonstrate the concepts instead of Matlab/Octave. 
1581,"instructor is too fast, video lectures are not enough and assignment questions are not clear which wastes much time just to understand the question"
1582,Excellent Course. It covers many useful topics and tips for Pandas.
1583,"The project that is the end assignment is a very interesting exercise with real life application of information that is readly available to the public for real-world decisions.Aside from that, it is a great course that scratchs the surface of what Pandas can do and open wide open all the possibilities it can give you :D"
1584,Challenging and well worth the effort.
1585,"A great practical course.This course will make you think and search a lot on stackoverflow,which is good because a lot can be learned by doing it ourselves.Then why this course because we need to know what to look for and this course gives us the basics and we will be able to do the assignments by ourselves .Its not really tough but will need some time to get all the answers correct."
1586,"Very challenging course yet very informative. I am looking forward to the rest of the courses in this series. A word of warning: if you are not familiar with statistics, parts will be very difficult. If you are not familiar with Python the whole course may be very very difficult. "
1587,Great Course!
1588,"So useful, learn the course through programming assignment, you need to do a lot of self-study and google, not just restrict within the course material, this is the way I love to study"
1589,Very helpful and demanding 
1590,Course should be more interactive and details
1591,"This is exactly the course you need to get started and familiar with Pandas. The home work requires a lot of self-study, which i enjoyed a lot. Only thing is that you have to wait until the end of the course to see best practice code for all home works."
1592,"Great course, Gives good outline to navigate through the essential content"
1593,Great Course!!!
1594,"Course is good. I'd like to see more code assignments, because the pandas basics should be studied in more details, IMHO."
1595,Excellent Introduction !!!
1596,good course. kickstarted me with python and datascience
1597,"Great course to learn python if you have prior coding experience with languages like java, C++ or javascript."
1598,"The professor speaks really fast, but the content is fantastic. This course is extremely practical."
1599,I really enjoyed this course. I found the instructor very good and the assignments were fun. I was pleasantly surprised by the whole course.
1600,assignment is a little bit messy.
1601,It was a challenge course!!!
1602,"After having taken several Data Science-related courses, this course seems like a good introduction to Python for Data Science applications. Not much 'actual Data Science' is covered in the course, however. It's more practically-oriented in the sense that it deals with data preparation (loading, cleaning and merging data). You don't get the luxury of the common perfectly-prepared csv-files in this course, which is a good thing!"
1603,Very good course.
1604,"I think the structure of the lessons are highly relevant for data sciecne and taught well. So for Syllabus content I think you are doing veryy wellCons: Nearly all the problems I encountered were related to the autograder not being helpful! There could be better error handling/debugging i.e. instead of just saying the answer is wrong, explain why and the aswer that is expected. For example, I spent DAYS on the final question (run ttest)of the last assignment. I had the right answer all along except the autograder was expecting the type to be numpy float 64, whereas my answer was just a float! "
1605,This was a good course and quite challenging. It requires a lot of self learning if you are not familiar with pandas. I wish some of the technics that were required to solve the assignments were better explained in the course material.
1606,"Excellent course and the content is presented very efficiently. I often watch lecture for other courses at a 1.25x or 1.5x speed, but this was different. I could barely keep up at the regular speed. Highly recommended."
1607,I recomendIntroduction to Data Science in Python it is a good piece of knowledge 
1608,"This is great course! I liked balance between theory and practice. And also tasks are covering something that is out of the week material, but can be easily found in the web (with provided suggestions)"
1609,"It is an interesting course. I would say this course expects more from students than other courses. It does not take you by the hand in working with Pandas. For the assignments you will spend a lot of time in the Pandas documentation and Stack Overflow. I don't know about others, but this lead to my code being very clunky and not Pandorable code."
1610,Really nice course to get you start with the Data science in Python
1611,Perfect course
1612,It provides a very good introduction to both Data Science and Python.
1613,"Great course! Dr. Brooks provides a nice and accessible introduction to Pandas, and the assignments are helpful and problem-based. Highly recommend!"
1614,unclear and poorly thought out
1615,Worth it! 
1616,"Pretty good course. I have definitely learned a lot and would like to thank you the lecturer and all the people who were working to create this course. The only comment I have is following. Please, try to formulate the questions more clear in the homework assignments. The assignment # 4 is especially bad in this sense. You can look at the comments of people in the forum to understand that it is not just my own problem. "
1617,One of the best courses in Coursera!!
1618,Assignments needs slight polishing. Otherwise course delivers what it promises.
1619,Spent more time figuring out what was being asked in the assignment rather than solving the assignment. Typos in assignment questions led to wasted hours without understanding why the grader kept rejecting solutions. Course content was useful and I would recommend if you are willing to live through the pain of the assignment submission.
1620,"Good for Beginners. Assignments are good but question framing was poor. Of course, required doubts are clarified through Discussions. Overall Great Experience doing this course. Thank you!"
1621,Very nice course. The only problem that I found was the lack of exercises between assignments.
1622,Challenging course but worth the effort! 
1623,Very good intro into how to use Pandas for working with data sets and get insights from your data by using various aggregating functions and statistical tests.
1624,Took me ages to complete the assignments given my limited programming skills! But totally enjoyed solving the problems. 
1625,"This course systematically introduced the use of Python and Pandas library to read data, clean data, transform data, and do statistical analysis."
1626,"Superb course and the staff from University of Michigan were quite committed with the learners, they've given me very valuables tools and skills, thanks a lot."
1627,Top free course about Data Science. But I think lectures must be more detailed and related to assignments. And assignments could be less ambiguous and more clear.
1628,"This is a really great course. Christopher Brooks teaches in a very clear and objective way, in addition to the weekly assignments that are challenging and puts into practice all the content you've learned trough the videos and the material. I really recommend this course!"
1629,"Although I had some background with Python and Pandas, this course brought new insights in both. With practical examples, it reinforces the conceptual understanding about working with data. I highly recommend this course even if you are already familiar with Pandas"
1630,"This is a fantastic introductory data science course on Python! I was wondered by the course structure, in-browser code editing and submitting. The first course which granted me an understanding of data cleansing, pandas and python for data science."
1631,"This is a *very* good Python Pandas course that's part of a data science specialization that I wish existed 3-4 years ago when I first started using Pandas. As much as I like Wes McKinney's book Python for Data Analysis, having an e-learning format mixing video lectures and hands-on assignments is a definite plus. I've decided to take this class out of curiosity (and in order to get ideas about a class I'm about to teach), and even if I consider myself as an experienced pandas user (top5% on stackoverflow for [pandas]). I think it's pretty involved if you're new to pandas and covers pretty much every key concept of pandas you should (must?) be aware of. The assignments can certainly look very challenging to the newcomer, and they do a great job of looking like an actual project: messy data, multiple sources, etc.I dearly recommend - and I have already started to personally recommend it - this course for anyone who's interested in learning more about data wrangling in pandas!Thanks for putting this together! "
1632,"The lectures and explanations need more clarity and better instruction quality. The assignment questions were often nebulous. This resulted in lots of time wasted with the grader. The discussion forums were the best part of this class. I'd encourage the course instructors to take a look at the University of Washington's Machine Learning class. Stylistically, pedagogically and content-wise - that's a much, much better Data Science class. "
1633,Terrible course. Assignments are extremely buggy and often touches on things not even explained in the lectures. Mentors are not active. Explanations are sketchy and not well paced. Do this course only for the examples in the Jupyter notebook.
1634,Best Python Pandas 101 course ever. Very recommend
1635,"I really like this course, it is a good kick off to learn and practice Pandas. The assignments are more difficult than the avg assignment in coursera courses which I think made this course more productive."
1636,It is a great course. especially on the excellent assignments.
1637,"This course was much harder than anticipated given it was also my first introduction to Python. Knowing Python coming into this course will make it a lot more manageable. Overall it's an excellent course which touches upon a LOT of items. Given more time on each item, this course could span 10 weeks easily. I now have an understanding of Python basics along with Pandas and a dash of numpy."
1638,"Lessons were ok but the assignments were really frustrating, not because of the questions itself but because the questions were organised badly or were really vague and confusing."
1639,"I love this kind of courses wehn the lectures are clear, short and meaningfull with real topics and hands on the topic, really good course"
1640,This course helps me a lot! Thanks for all staffs. Hope the grader system coud give more specific feedback.
1641,"Assignments are challenging, but some questions are very vague and require lots of trial and error guesswork to get the autograder to accept them."
1642,"The course gives practice in Python, but programming assignments were loaded with busy work that added little value and often had only loose ties to the material discussed in class. While this forces more independent learning, it also makes it so that this course isn't really much better than free online tutorials. I found myself learning almost everything for the programming assignments from the pandas package documentation and from Google searches that led to stackoverflow. For an instructor from the University of Michigan whose bio says I work with colleagues to design tools to better the teaching and learning experience in higher education, I was expecting a lot more value for the time spent in this class. I suspect that this course is being used to provide data for furthering his own research. It's often more difficult to maximize value to customers when personal incentives may not be perfectly aligned with customer (student) objectives."
1643,"I was quite disappointed by the almost total inaccessibility of the staff in the discussion forums, the unconquerability of the autograder for most of the assignments (losing points for no discernible reason, with all resources exhausted), the lack of a stats module for the specialization, and the lack of education, really. There is value in asking students to learn on their own, but this course goes much too far with that, giving problem sets that are virtually unsolvable without prior experience in data wrangling in R or some other data language. This leaves serious, hardworking students with little choice but to troll the forums for solutions. Hardly the best way to learn the intricacies of this subject."
1644,"great hands on course, with challenging exercises and fast paced lectures.the homework assignments need some rephrasing, as it is not always clear whats being asked.looking forward to the second course in this specialization"
1645,Overall I thought the level of the course was good. The programming assignments were complex and long enough that you had a good opportunity to re-inforce topics covered in the course. I already had a good bit of pandas experience so the course was helpful to re-inforce things I was already familiar with but hadn't been forced to try out. I think if you don't already have pandas experience the assignments might be tough.
1646,High quality content and challenging assignments. Really good!
1647,"This course is accurately advertised as requiring intermediate programming experience. It focusses on some of the basic python tools that are used in data science like pandas, specifically dataframes. For a python newbie like me, some of the assignments were quite challenging as they required significant additional reading and search. I would have appreciated if all of the concepts required to solve the assignments were introduced in the same week, so my additional reading and search would have been more targeted. Very little stats if any is required or taught. "
1648,"I thought the videos for this course were appropriately concise and well-done. The projects were about the right difficulty and length (although the one for week three was more time consuming than expected). They were interesting enough to keep engaged. I think the span of topics was also useful and appropriate. I would have liked if the autograder gave more detailed output on what was wrong with a submission. I also think it would be extremely beneficial to see the right ways of solving this problems after a submission is completed. I'm sure I didn't use the optimal pandas approach in some instances, as it stands I seem to have no way of knowing and improving my knowledge beyond getting a passing grade."
1649,"Not so easy ,not too hard!"
1650,Good content - some prior knowledge of pandas is important.
1651,"Good course, going a bit fast on certain aspects but good use of Jupyter and interesting coursework, challenging enough."
1652,Good lectures and a good introduction to the subject matter. Definitely requires additional research and practice is weak on Python and the Pandas library. The comments in the auto grading could be more helpful.
1653,"Good introductory course, but I must admit that the assignments are not explained well enough."
1654,"Very nice introduction, I wish homework were more clear and the autograder was much more smarter. "
1655,the best ever
1656,it has a very good method of teaching and it is very informative :))
1657,"This is a popular course series that many have expressed interest in taking. Rigorous and challenging course that offers excellent, high quality teaching of python pandas. The University of Michigan does not disappoint and neither does the delightful instructor Christopher Brooks. I highly recommend this course to anyone serious about python and data manipulation. Time and money worth spent. Interesting assignments and datasets are found each week. You will learn a great deal. Concise videos with sharp insights from an expert on pandas are seen throughout. Once you finish the first course of the series, it leaves you excited for the second course in the series. Rock on pandorable pandistas! "
1658,Wonderful Instructor. Course assignment is strong enough to learn this things. Thanks for this great course.
1659,Excellent one
1660,"Completed the course and found it pretty good for the first run. Mostly focused on the Pandas library - you'll be ok if you know a bit of Python, or have experience in another language.Looking forward to subsequent courses."
1661,"assignment is really hard, takes me 30 hours at least"
1662,"Super challenging, but good fun!"
1663,This is a very useful course. I recommended this course at people that already know how to programming. Week's homework are more difficult than in the description and needs more time( for my personal experience )
1664,Good COurse 
1665,One of the best place to start in Data Science
1666,"This course is a decent introduction to using the python pandas data science package, but suffers from some problems.The lectures are very brief and do not prepare you well for the assignments. The assignments are not well described and the autograder is very finicky. As a result, every week I spent several hours on the fora and stackoverflow to figure out what the autograder wants, instead of actually learning pandas. I managed to pass this course with (what I know is) subpar code, but we never get to see proper solutions to the assignments.The course has potential, but as it is now, I will continue this specialisation."
1667,"The instructor is warm and seems pretty interested.Content is way too minimal though and it's not enough to prepare the student for the assessments.A lot of searching is required in order to arrive at the solution which more often than not is not the most optimum one. Forums are only supported by fellow students and staff's involvement is next to zero in there. Even threads that deal with clarifying questions were not answered by the staff.I understand that this way enforces community building and helping fellow students, but staff's participation would be highly appreciated."
1668,"Well, first thing I am going to say this is not going to be looking good, however correct me if I got anything wrong or being unfair.To be honest, I am very frustrated with this course! It is a very good topic that I am very interested and that's the reason I am enrolled , but the support and the structure of it is very disappointing!Example like this(https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/discussions/weeks/3/threads/0kwIpLJDEeawPhIF4bjuNg), question is not even specified and waste me so much time looking for the requirement and post discussion board and wait hopefully somebody is going to reply!Same for the ScimEn file , which again the file name was not specified in the question!From last secession, assignment two have lots of confusing around what exactly the question is asking about and again lots of time being wasted just to figure out the question!The support is poor as well, not like other course , I would usually get a answer within the same day , but this one is really when you are lucky! Plus the staff rarely response!In short, I hope the staff of the course would see this. This is a good topic but the course are poorly designed with very limited support!I mean if you are truly love the topic , you should pass on the passion to your students and design the course that students not only learn the material in the course but also can know how to ask questions and find out the questions themselves ,but first like learning any skills students needs to ask lots of questions ! I am not going to mention that ,coz even the question in the course is full of error !!Unless, the whole purpose is to make some money , then it make sense , however if it is that case , I am not going to enrol in this course any more."
1669,"It's a good course over all. There is only one thing that I would like to suggest, which is that the autrograder does not seem to work well. It really wasted me lots of time to get the RIGHT ANSWER understood by the autograder."
1670,great intro course
1671,Very good... but question should have been properly explained (in a detail manner).. overall it was a great learning experience
1672,great course
1673,"Lectures clear and well-organized. Homework needlessly complicated and with large gap from lecture material. Grader did not give enough info when rejecting submitted work. Weighting last problem at 50% of final week was unpleasant. Hosted platform allowed importing re and io.StringIO, but grader rejected them. Hosted platform had consistent kernel failure on my last solution, but it worked on another system and grader accepted it."
1674,"The programming assignments are challenging ( atleast for beginners),with each question taking about 3 hours to complete .Many topics in Pandas are covered , making us reading the docs and finding solutions,that further helps in learning . Excellent course , good support from other learners taking the course and very very informative . No other platform can give us a course ( and knowledge ) of this standard . Planning to take more courses from courseera . However a small feedback : The description for some questions are slightly confusing . Please make such questions more descriptive with examples . "
1675,"Good material, let down by instructors. "
1676,quite interesting and challenging
1677,Good one! Enjoyed
1678,"Contents are very good and assignments are challenging. Perhaps I struggled most trying to understand what the questions actually ask, they should be rephrased or be more clear. But it was a nice course and I would to it again. I am waiting for the next courses to begin."
1679,Thanks!
1680,The course was really great. Thank you! Sometimes precisely what the questions were asking weren't clear (This may have been resolved by a notebook upgrade but I did not realise this until it was too late) and I did have some issues with the autograder. Otherwise would be five stars.
1681,"Really handy and useful materials. However, if we can share our codes online after receiving the certificate will be really helpful. Cause although I finished the course, I still find some of my code is repetitive and not pandorable, and I would like to learn from other talents. Thanks Coursera and University of Michigan. "
1682,"Autograder is hard to understand and has no feedback. Could improve the feedback mechanism, maybe with peer review. Thanks for the course!"
1683,I learned A LOT during this course. I was even able to apply some of this knowledge at work after week 2 (and I do not have a technical job - I do this on my own time).It did feel a little complicated at some times. Some more detailed explanations in the assignments could help. We don't always know what the autograder expects...
1684,"A course which has great assignments. However, the video itself is a bit boring. Most of the time, my motivation to learn this course is just doing its assignments. At the same time, the assignments are somewhat difficult for those who are not familiar with Python, but for me it's just OK. What I want to make complaints about the assignments is that sometimes the Autograder is so rigid that I have to try one question over and over again until the Autograder feels happy, and for me, sometimes the gap between correct answer and incorrect answer isn't so large...And finally, thank you, teacher Christopher Brooks! You are ateacher full of passion, and I actually learnt a lot from you and your course."
1685,"Lectures were interesting and well put together, however the assignments and the knowledge required for the assignments were not covered in the lecture material. While I can appreciate that every course will require some elements of self-learning and exploration, this felt a step too far. My sense is that if you have some experience in the actual topics covered by the course, and are looking to verify your knowledge with a certificate, you will be fine. However if you are hoping to actually learn about the topics, you are going to have to work very hard. I'm hoping that the coverage of course material to assignment requirements is a lot better in the subsequent courses in this specialization."
1686,This course covers basics of pandas dataframes. So useful for amateur/advanced programmers who want to start learning data science. The assignments are very good and help students learn how to pre-process and use data retrieved from web.
1687,"The class was a helpful intro to pandas. But it was not as much a class as it was a series of homework assignments and the student painstakingly looking things up on stackoverflow. In the end, i am positive I got the correct answers using a horrible coding method and will never see the correct solutions. There should be a little bit more handholding in order for the student to learn the concepts. Otherwise, I might just throw a class up on coursera, give the link to docs.python.org, tell the students to read it and then they will be experts at python."
1688,"A hands on course on the basic tools needed to process data from experiments, web data, etc. The final assignment demands everything learned througout the course and it's a perfect example for what one would face on a daily basis."
1689,starting to like this
1690,"Very hard course comparatively speaking, especially when one needs to manage so many other things. But I think it was worth the figurative blood and tears. Thank you!"
1691,Great course
1692,"Excellent class, learned quickly and simply !"
1693,Really great course about data science in python and pandas in particular. Absolutely recommended!
1694,Learn a lot with Pandas.
1695,"I have two general comments:The first comment is . . . there was too wide a gap between the lecture content and the assignments. The second comment I have is . . . I spent too much time trying to figure out what the autograder wanted and not enough time learning Data Science with Python. I can only imagine the work that it takes to develop and launch a course like this. In all, I'm very excited to be part of this program. My comments are critical but hopefully helpful and all your work is appreciated."
1696,"This course wasn't quite the cakewalk I was expecting it to be, which is perfectly fine! I definitely would recommend this course for anyone looking to pursue data science/machine learning professionally. I learned a lot of skills that employers look for, and have applied the things I've learned here in other course work as well. 5/5 would recommend."
1697,"Great course, assignments take more time than listed, and I found the discussion forum very helpful to learn more about the assignments and interact with other classmates. Overall I learned so much of commands from this course. "
1698,The assignments do not have clear definition and guildlines. It is very hard to see what's getting wrong in the submission.
1699,Very good.
1700,"Course teaches Python Pandas in a very practical way and I'm sure now having learnt it I'll use the skill. But this course wasn't taught well. Weekly assignments asked questions about skills that had not been taught yet. The course coordinators didn't respond or help in the forums, The topic area deserves more in depth video lectures and discussion. All the above basically means that passing the weekly assignments takes longer than you may assume. Had the course been taught and tested more effectively then doing the weekly assignments would less frustrating and time consuming. Basically the course is good, but it requires much more work and research because of the poor way its caught and monitored by staff."
1701,Great course! I liked how the focus was mainly on the practical aspects of data science. No 'dry' course material. I know much more about the practical side of data analysis than before! Thank you!
1702,"The lectures are insufficient, the homework instructions are incorrect, the autograder is terrible."
1703,"The course is interesting, but the grading system needs to improve substantially. The grader bugs considerably, and the questions are often not well defined, which requires a lot of unnecessary trial and error to understand what exactly the question was about. Finally, complete the assignments took way long that what it is suggested."
1704,"This is in fact the worst course so far. Mainly because of auto grader. Here are my reasons.Actually I did not complete the course at all. But I suddenly got a message saying that I have completed the course. I was working on the first problem of the 4th assignment. I did a provisional submission to see if my answer was right. Auto grader reported the grade for the 3rd assignment and said that I have passed the course. Any submission I did after that was not graded at all.The assignments are not very clear. Looks like I had a older version of the questions while others had a different version. I was stuck in a particular problem because auto grader did not give me a clear feedback as to why I was incorrect. I wasted too much time on this already.The assignments require too much research outside what is covered in the videos. I don't feel that is right. The assignment requires that we research on Stack Overflow and Pandas documentation. I strongly feel that such activities should be performed only outside the course work when we try to solve real world problems. Course assignments should be reasonably given based only the materials covered in video. This was taking too much time.TThe discussion forums are not giving clear hints. When we are stuck in a problem, we are not able to proceed further. I still son't know the answers for certain problems because the coordinators do not explain the answers well. When we complete assignments we don't get to see the instructor's solution. The video instructions were too fast paced. The instructors do not pause and explain critical aspects of the code. Overall I am very disappointed with this course. There are much better videos on Youtube and Lynda than this . I am sorry. I never thought it would be this bad. The first course on Python from University of Michigan was really very good."
1705,The assignments were good but it was a lot of time spent with the grader. 
1706,Nice course to learn data science.
1707,it's a really good course .it's not like a traditional course in university in China.You should put all your efford to finish it.And it full of challenge
1708,"The course was great - the lectures were clear and simple; I learned a great deal! However, instructions for the assessments could have been clearer, and there were a few issues with the autograder (though I'm sure those will be weeded out)."
1709,"Even short, but give a hint and big picture how data science works"
1710,"This course was excellent...I first found the course odd since the instructor went through the material quite quickly in the lectures. It took me a while to figure out that the material was available as a course download. Once I found that it was easy to follow along with the instructor...need two monitors ideally for this to work. If you cannot step through the Jupyter notebook as the instructor goes through the material, you will be lost...and you will not get the most out of the class."
1711,"The course is good and provide great challenges to do a lot of things with Python and Pandas. However, I find that its resource material sometimes lacking complex examples. This may be intentional in order for the students to learn from external resources as well. However, this can also causes difficulties for people who are not already familiar with Pandas before they start following the course."
1712,"Great! Even for someone with some python / pandas experience, it was a nice refresher / found new tips / tricks. I actually enjoyed the fact that the assignments didn't hold your hand and forced students to solve problems with the forum and other resources. Look forward to the rest of the courses in this specialisation! Two aspects you could improve is teaching is (1) Multiindex and (2) Regex. It seemed like you purposely avoided discussing these. These should be a mandatory subjects to learn. "
1713," The theory and examples are very good and cover a lot of functionalities. I like most the questions that pop up in the middle of the videos, it is a great way to check whether you understood the concepts. Some parts require refinements, the questions in the middle of the videos must be synchronized with the content (there is a little time gap) and the questions in the weekly assignments must be reviewed in depth, I dislike wasting a lot of time trying to understanding what is required to answer in each question. "
1714,This course is a challenging (and solid) introduction to using python.
1715,"This was way above my level knowledge. One will definitely a strong level of knowledge in stats and data analysis to begin with. The Python part is but only a tool in this module / course. For that reason I found the tutorials way too fast paced. I had to go back on everything and test, so a 5 mins tutorial video would sometimes take me 30 mins or longer to complete.The 3 hour / 4 hour assessments took me days! Yet - a great way to jump into something new! The course itself is great. The presentation and content is just as great."
1716,I like the course very much. It was fun to learn and to do the exercises. There were some rough edges in the assignments but I'm sure these will be straightened out in time.
1717,"The content and assignments are certainly useful and relevant. However, the lectures are too short and do not help much with doing the assignment. As a beginner, I relied heavily on google and the discussion forum to get through the assignment. And I am not sure if i can actually tackle similar problems again without referring back to the pre-mentioned resources."
1718,Excellent! A little harder for new students in python but very interesting!
1719,More concise coding tutorials and less search on your own on the internet needed. It is great to get to know the online community and the course needs more coding example directly relat to exams.
1720,"Wow, this course was intense but worth it!"
1721,A great introductory class to data science with challenging assignments to build a solid understanding of pandas and numpy . 
1722,"It is useful, but there are some notable flaws. My biggest problems were with the clarity of the assignment questions (some were unacceptably vague) and the feedback that the autograder gives. Fortunately, fellow classmates on the forums are extremely helpful in figuring this all out."
1723,"Excellent class. Needs a little work to make sure assignments a little more clear, but with a bit of work from the student, it's a great learning experience. "
1724,"The jupyter notebook made this a horrid experience. Plus Coursera really doesn't want you to bother them with your silly questions, relying on peer-forums. If you scroll through the week's discussion forums, many student posts go ignored.You can't drop the course past the second (I guess) week so the system will keep on keeping on long after you've given up on trying to figure out the janky notebook thing.Will not return to Coursera for any reason. Breathtakingly bad experience."
1725,"Very knowledgeable professors, but very little explanation or actual 'teaching'. Graded assignments require a lot of self-education."
1726,"I like the content covered in the lectures. That's very useful for me to clean data parsed from webpages. There is one thing I hope the course can improved, which probably has been mentioned in the forum for many times: the auto-grader is not flexible that it doesn't grant any points to answers that is slightly different from the submitted form (e.g. upper/lower cases, white space, etc.) and we have a hard time figuring out what exactly the auto-grader is accepting. I would suggest modifying the auto-grader such that it allows flexibility in answer acceptance, or breaking down questions into smaller parts (more partial credits) and give more precise/detailed description on the format of answer expected.

1727,"Really good course BUT be prepared for a very fast pace of the lectures. I'd placed in the advance beginner or intermediate low level, therefore, you need to have previous knowledge of Python. As in College, lectures and assignments are somewhat related, but you will spend some additional time investigating by yourself to get the appropriate responses. Again, just like College where Lectures are level 2-3 but assignments are level 7-8 (out of 10)."
1728,I thank so much professor Brooks and the team of the cours. 
1729,"Awsome course with good balance betweern Challange,Reasearch and Progression."
1730,"Although the tests can be a bit fiddly, this is a great course if you already have a bit of background with Python and/or data cleaning. Lecture and tutorial videos are lean and information-dense. "
1731,"This course was excellent. This course deviates from many garbage MOOC who only work with quiz and can not provide a real python coding challenge experience. Assignements are really tough. But my sense of progress is real.(I have struggled to identify such feel in many pytyhon MOOC). Jupyter base for everythjng is a fantatsic format(it even allows coding mobility betwwen my station at work and my home station through the coding on jupyter in the cloud) . My feedback nevertheless will point to some aspect in my experience and where I think you can improve. Succeeding the assignement does not mean that we identified the most elegant way to apply all the knowledge of the course(lambdas,list comprehension, grouping..., apply) in our coding. Breaking that barrier is not easy for me unless we are forced at it and so my looping mind is often applied in assignments. A real correction with the answer need to be provided(this is what the real classroom would do, we managed to get to the answer but we could still learn more with an assisted correction just like what the real classroom would do.I understand that you are worry that the model will end up as copy paste on a webpage and will kill your value. You could maybe consider this add_on for paid customers only and only provide it in picture way which can only be paper print and not so easily converted to webpage format.Or you need to find an alegant way to randomize the assignment coding test at each coursera session, which in that case would not bring any forgery issue and you could provide the correction at the end of the course(or after each assigment completed).Videos are a bit too fast on concepts sometimes. You could split the assigment in two formats: format where simple principle of the course are first resolved on jupyter notebook (just like the videos case but with more exercices) and complex dataframe case as second assignment .(but please reduce the amounts of case to only 1 or 2, not 3) You could reduce dataframe case.(I've spend easily 40 hours on assigment here, assigment time is too heavy from my workload as a full time scientist. This needs some carefull tuning.Overall Great Job"
1732,"Really awesome course. It is a kind of do it yourself course.The assignments are tough to crack. I think a little bit of programming experience is neccessary. The lectures themselves only give the basic knowledge. The assignments make you do research on the relevant topics. The autograder is pretty bad, it gives false negatives a lot of times, but that i believe is Coursera's drawback and they are working on it."
1733,"Very challenging course. And I thought I knew Python. I learned much, much more about Pandas, idioms, lambdas, regex, etc. I will be able to be more productive at work with all this. Thanks."
1734,"Excellent course, I learned a lot especially through the assignments. Missing a fifth star because of a lot of issues with the notebooks autograding, and sometimes imprecise instructions in the assignments. Still I look forward to working on the next pandas courses!"
1735,Contents are great and very relative. Exam is fair and reasonable. However students have to deal with an autograder for the scores and the autograder is not up to par for this course. The amount of time that you spend on learning during the course is only a fraction of time you spend to get through the autograder. 
1736,"The course was challenging, and although I would have liked a bit more information from the video lectures, and a bit more practice on using the basic functions, I learned a lot. I thought the video lectures were a little sparse. There were only 20-30 minutes worth of video lectures per week and the assignments required you to stretch the knowledge that you gained from the lecture videos quite a bit. More examples in video lectures would have helped. I would have also liked to see a few simple problems in each assignments just to get comfortable using the various functions introduced in the lecture. So overall, the course was challenging and definitely a fair amount of work coming from someone new to python (but moderately experienced in C programming), and although I would have liked a bit more guidance, I learned a lot."
1737,Pace of lectures is rather fast and doesn't fit to homework level (which is much harder). But overall course is OK
1738,"A good introduction to python and data science. The questions were just about the right level of difficulty. My main criticism is that the online videos were pretty short and not going into a lot of detail, whereas with the questions you had to do a lot of extra research to figure out how to solve them. More interaction with the enrolled students during the course and having more in-depth videos would make the course a lot better."
1739,No or least support.Course Quality is great but problems with grader will left you with wasting your expensive time.Assignments are good but intend to go wayyy more beyond the scope and to learn from online materials though other sites.Grading system is not easy. You have the right answer but you'll need to waist hours to produce specific string for your grader to be satisfied.This i not an elegant learning process at all.
1740,Very nice!
1741,"Total disaster. I payed 315euro for this course. Course started on 24/10/2016. I faced with technical difficulties till this weekend. I reported this problem already many times.. Finally this weekend the Jupiter notebook worked and I started the first assignment. I spent many hours but still couldn't get solve the assignment. I read discussions, write post.. Searched on Google.. Read lots of document. I still couldn't get what the correct answer is the assignment wants. I realized that it is impossible to pass this exam. In the lectures they don't mention anything which will help you to solve this time consuming assignment by the way.. After having this terrible course experience this weekend, today (14/11/2016) I decided to apply for refund. But guess what I says 14 days have passed so I cannot get refund!!!! Now I payyed 315 euro for nothing but disappointment!!!!"
1742,good intro to pandas and some numpy. students need to deep dive into each subject to become proficient
1743,"Good course materials and the assignment itself is pretty good, but the grader is buggy, not informative and wasted a lot of my time."
1744,Take this course if u can invest a lot of time in searching for stuff yourself. Content and videos are okay but the assignments are very tough
1745,The course is very interesting. The Jupiter notebook is very useful.I don't like that many examples are very US-specific. Some important terms may not be clear for people who live outside USA. Update: I'm lowering my grade from 4 stars to 3 stars because of very confusing assignments. Often it's not clear the requirement of the task. It takes very long to understand. Also some assignments require methods and functions that were not covered in video lectures.
1746,Great course.
1747,"besides the major technical issues and lack of information before the postponed start of the course and minor technical issues, the way of teaching is well adapted to on-site classes where you can sit in study groups solving the problems together; the given examples have partly little relevance and do not help to solve the assignments and according to the staff the best way to solve assignments is by using google (or stackoverflow or whatever) - really?! somehow it seems they just took an on-site course, played with some fancy technical solutions and call it now a MOOC... they seem not really aware of the fact that on-site teaching and MOOCs require completely different types of pedagogic methodsamazing how the same university can offer both the best MOOC (Dr. Chuck's) and one of the worst (this one) "
1748,"Amazing Training on Python Data Science, doing the course assignment its like read the book Python for data analysis. I believe this course is not trivial and is not intermediate level, is an advanced level, Is a real challenge. Definitively i recommend it. "
1749,"A great intro to pandas. Challenging even for those with experience using the library. There were some struggles with the autogravder, but they were being worked out, and the integration of the Jupyter notebook system directly into the class is fantastic."
1750,Great Course! 
1751,"lots of practice, enjoyable."
1752,"Very nice course format. Sometimes really challenging, and outright fun ! I wish there would have been a little more participation by staff / mentors, but this is just a minor cutback. Recommended to everyone !"
1753,"This course is good but instructor is very bad..... Not providing good course lectures and materials... The lecture is very fast and not covering all the things being asked in the assignment... I am leaving this course due to this.. I have successfully done other python courses, because there, the instructor was very good and his teaching style was awesome... I have wasted lot of my times enrolling in this particular course... Though the course conception is good, instructor and course materials are not up to the mark...."
1754,Excellent material. Excellent teaching. Challenging problem sets. Autograder needs some work.
1755,"To be honest, I think the course is very good, however, it may be need to more clear on the description of the questions in assignment. "
1756,Great pace for intermediate level people.
1757,"Great course, fast and deep, I liked it very much"
1758,an exceptional course by MU. Very good course and content
1759,nice class
1760,Very good lectures and examples. Horrible autograder - very stiff and all results must be in a very strict order and format. Extremenly vague questions prone to misinterpretation. Most of the time is not spent on analysing data or coding but trying to understand the autograder and questions. The stress should be somewhere else. As a whole poorly prepared course. 
1761,Very good design and teaching for a intermediate level learning course! Easy to learn with practice with Jupyter notebook.
1762,I really liked the course. I learned a lot.
1763,"An Awesome tutorial to start learning Data science using Python and its Libraries ( NUMPY, PANDAS and etc...)"
1764,"The course is great for senior data analyst. However, you need to learn by yourself probability and statistics because they do not cover them in this course."
1765,Awesome !!!
1766,Tough speed - learning effect created by the weekly assignments. Good start into data sience.
1767,"The course is overall very good and is definitely a very complete introduction to the topic.Sometimes I found the pace of the course a bit too fast: it's quite difficult to focus on the Professor's explanations and, at the very same time, follow the commands typed on the jupyter notebook (not to mention reproducing them on my own!!). The python exercises are overall quite well done, even though in some parts they could benefit from clearer explanations (thankfully almost always provided in the discussion section). Be careful that often the programming assignments go beyond what has been explained in the lectures and therefore require an active search in the documentation, on online forum such as stack overflow or in the resources section."
1768,Gained a lot of knowledge on using the pandas library in a short time. Introduced interesting topics on different data science topics like Goodhart's law etc.
1769,"Excellent course, the teacher gives clear introduction, and the exercise is very useful to train our skill. I have no hesitation to recommend it to my classmates."
1770,"Great introductory course on data science in python. However, the final projects diverts significantly from the course material, requiring vast amounts of self-study for someone new to Python. Definitely learned a lot in this course."
1771,Thanks
1772,simply the best intro to data science!
1773,Very well prepared. 4 stars because it only scratches the surface of data wrangling with Pandas. I'd love to see more comprehensive course about Pandas.
1774,"Excellent introductory course to Pandas. Four stars because the pace of the videos are too fast and the assignments requires, sometimes, excesive individual learning. Hopefully the info found in the forums is very helpfull. "
1775,Very good starter on learning the basics for python data analysis.
1776,"Not a bad starter, considering it's a free course, but the lectures were somewhat short. Some things from lectures and tasks were pretty discouraging. For example, on week 4 there is a task that culminates in doing a T-test, but all that the lecturer says about it is I'm not going to go into detail here, read wikipedia page or take a statistics course to know what the t-test is. Well, it's definitely not a nice thing to say on an introductory course. Same goes to Pearson correlation coefficient - it's in the task, but not explained anywhere on the course. Not all of us have a background in statistics.Tasks are implemented in the form of IPython notebooks (essentially a web page where one can write Python code) and rated by an automated rater, which sometimes gives good clues, but sometimes result was incorrect is all you get in response. What I felt was not very convenient is that the rater is asynchronous - you can't run it directly on your current notebook, you have to send your work to be rated using a special button instead. Then after some minutes yo can see the result on a separate page. It works, but slows down the process a bit."
1777,The course was wonderful. Really helped in understanding what Data Science is about.
1778,"Very interesting course, with good assignments. It's a nice introduction to Python."
1779,Too many things to learn. The best Python course I've had so far!!
1780,very good course and the lecturer is very good.
1781,The course is quite challenging on weekly assignments. I learned a lot striving to pass.
1782,"Great experience , online video's explained the idea of the concept but the learner need to practice off line mode a lot to get through all the concepts listed in the course and assignment. these practices will improve self learning skill and confidence. Thank you."
1783,Excellent course. Well-organized lecture material and extremely relevant intro to Python and Pandas.
1784,good intro
1785,Good introduction to Pandas library
1786,Very helpful in learning Pandas. Overall a very well designed short course. The only minor difficulty I had was HW submission. It took some time to figure out what could be wrong.
1787,Great intro course for Python!
1788,Good. I learned lots of things from this course
1789,Tough course for a Introduction to... course title. Good support resources saved the day. Learnt from doing the assignments and following the tips from the teaching staff. Very practical assignments. Gave a flavor of what data science work involves. Challenging and engaging. The course videos are very well produced. Prof. Brooks is motivating and energizing. The course also gave a human dimension to the work of data science. Thank you.
1790,"Good course; a great intro to relevant concepts with guidance towards realistic tasks. Only negative is that sometimes problems are unclear (maybe its just me) and spent too much time trying to get outputs exactly right to pass auto-grader. Good experience, and I plan on continuing with the specialization."
1791,"This is a very helpful course. The main advantage is that you will learn a lot of new ways to do operations over data. And this is an intermediary course that assumes that you already know about statistics, mathematics behind data. From my experience I want to tell that if you are taking this course don't just rely on the video this course provide (however videos gives you full context on the work that has to be done), you have to do your own research and reading from external sources too. "
1792,"The explanation and content in teaching video is too brief for the assignment. It cannot not provide sufficient concept and knowledge for student to complete it, especially who not familiar with pandas."
1793,"Course was good , i wish number of exercises were more."
1794,"Excellent course, and very well taught. The projects are a bit difficult for beginners and will require independent learning as well as revising the lectures, but such is anything important in life.The only thing I think the course can benefit from is a printed summary of lectures, since they can be quite dense with information! But I think the Jupyter Notebooks are a good inclusion as is."
1795,"I thought there were going to be more lecture style, more videos to listen, more examples, and more things to learn. What I end up doing was to read stackoverflow as suggested by the instructor, and to do homework. I understand that I have to learn by practice, but I still expected that the instructor will give more material for me to learn before I practice, not to practice by learning from stackoverflow. Assign a reading material or pages/chapters in a textbook to read is still better than asking me to find everything by myself from stackoverflow. To be fair, I learned python, padas, and dataframe from this course as promised by the syllabus. At the end, I think I just got what $79 can do for me, not good, not bad, it is OK. If I knew that it was going to be like this, I will pay for it, yes still pay for it. Does it worth my money, yes for $79. Do I like it very much, no. I think this course can be better if more material/videos can be added. Will I continue to other courses in this series, yes $79 is a fair price."
1796,Very good course although the assagissements are a little bit too difficult (at least to me...) 
1797,very good course
1798,Some issues when validating the assignements automatically but the forums are very helpful. Overall great course to start learning python and the libraries pandas and numpy.
1799,"There were some gaps that were tough to bridge, but I got there."
1800,"At the end of the course, I feel the confidence it has given me in handling data."
1801,The course was easy to understand. The reason i'm giving 3 stars is more on the preparation of the entire set of courses. They kinda develop as the course goes. The other 4 courses of the specialization were not even ready after this course was done. 
1802,It's awesome!
1803,"The course per se deserves 5 stars, however the grader (=the program which checks you programming) is a pain in the a**. I once submitted a float but it wanted a float 64 ... well yea ...The Tips in the discussion forum are great - however they could be highlighted better (e.g. extra post).I especially loved the discussion prompts. I thought them very important."
1804,Fantastic course with a lot of details &amp; focus on Python.
1805,It's a great course with attention to detail. The assignments are very detailed which help a lot in grasping the key concepts.
1806,Fully recommended course.
1807,Very useful revision of basic Python skills required to perform the assignments and introduction of useful new tools and concepts to acquire and prepare data for later manipulation and analysis.
1808,"I learnded how to effectively use pandas to process data, very good lesssons"
1809,"Great learning experience with a very good teacher. A little bit difficult but, hey this is science!"
1810,"They follow a practical approach and present you only the very relevant material so you do not stuck too much into theory. Note that this is an intermediate-level course and you need some experience, self-learning skills, and some patience to be successful. "
1811,"In the beginning I thought that the course should have more Tips and Help to the student.After finishing it, I understand that having the ability to search for the solution without too helping is good to produce the data science skills."
1812,"Awesome course to start study datascience using python, nice and hard projects to do!"
1813,Excellent course with very challenging assignments!
1814,"The main focus of the course is the introduction of the Pandas (series and data frames) library, which is very useful in data analysis. The last two assignments are quite challenging and time consuming, if you are not familiar with Pandas. Why the poor review: I'm sure that the intention of the teacher (Prof. Brooks) is for the student to be challenged and obtain familiarity with several advanced functionalities of Python. When I had finished the last assignment I felt that way, but not due to the lectures (only ~2.5 hours all in all). The pace of these lectures is too fast (probably because they are scripted). The teacher should slow down a bit and show some more examples (for inspiration watch Prof. Andrew Ng from Stanford lecture on machine learning). I'm not suggesting to show explicit solutions of the assignments, but just a few more examples such that the transition from lecture to problem solving is less frustrating. Furthermore, the students are paying $79 for this course expecting thorough lectures on the topic. Reading the documentation of the Pandas library can be done for free..."
1815,This course was really useful. It progressed at a good pace and concepts were explained clearly.
1816,it creates my base and provide me an overview of Data Science.Great assignments to play with real time data.
1817,Good introduction to Pandas and Numpy. I enjoyed the assignments.
1818,Great course! Covers important features of Python which are most likely to be used in Data Science. Programming assignments are really interesting.
1819,tough but glad I make it through
1820,Awesome work :)
1821,Great course for beginners in data science with some knowledge in python. Nice techniques for data cleaning and transformation are shown. But one needs more than what is in the lecture videos to complete the assignments.
1822,This source has been proven to be very useful during my data science internship. I was doing tasks for data wrangling which require heavy pandas syntax and this source has provided me with exactly that.
1823,very good
1824,Great course. It provide a good platform to understand Python with Pandas in depth. 
1825,Fantastic way to learn pandas 
1826,Very complete and challenging course. Highly recommend to those who want to get the basics (as it was in my case). Staff is very supportive and constantly answering on the forums.Congratulations to the University of Michigan
1827,"Great course to get started on with Data Science. Lectures are simple and to the point, questions are challenging and practical. Adding a little more theoretical background to the subject would bring more strength to the course."
1828,Knew basic idea about how to manipulate data with Python
1829,"Great class, not overwhelming, right pace to learn when you are working a day job."
1830,Great course. I enjoyed from beginning till end. Lectures are very clear and assignments focused on based on real data. Thanks a lot.
1831,Challenging and fun course. I can see how powerful this methodology can be.
1832,Good Course 
1833,Definitely one of the most useful courses I have done in Coursera. Took me a while to get the rhythm but after that everything was smooth. As it says you will really need an INTERMEDIATE level of Python for it. 
1834,"very good, but some difficult to finish the assignment if have no coding experience."
1835,What a great course! I have some R and Matlab experience and it was a perfect course for me to hit the ground running with Python.
1836,Good through introduction to using Pandas. Instruction needs to go into more examples and explanations. I needed to use stackoverflow to get through 60% of the assignments. Few assignment questions are ambiguous and I never found out why my answer is incorrect. Where's the solutions?
1837,Excellent course to learn about pandas and numpy
1838,Great introduction to the basics of the pandas library with plenty of opportunity for self-driven learning and exploration.
1839,"An excellent course, which requires more self learning than what is taught. I extended the course and completed the final assignment in a week. The assignments involving data cleaning actually helps a budding data scientist. Documentation, Stack Overflow for assignments is a must which can boost your understanding not just for this course but for a lot more. My personal satisfaction about this course is mainly stackoverflow part which helped me to understand the lectures weeks ahead. But application of the concepts on assignments is a difficult one which can only be mastered after practice. Thanks to all mentors, especially Sophie Greene whom I followed a lot. Her debugs, algos and code checks have actually helped me to understand both python and Pandas better. "
1840,"The assignments of the course are hard and make you go deep into python, to try to find the answers. I spent more time than I expected on it, but once my target is knowledge I really enjoy. Recommend! (Attention: It is strongly recommend knows programming before enroll)"
1841,The course was very helpful. Learned a lot from the problems. 
1842,"This has been a eye opening experience, it allows you to thing about normal life and the way we handle data differently, the course is very bast to be an introduction level but I didn't mind it at all, I'm happy it is this way."
1843,"It is a good course, but a little difficult for a newer."
1844,This course is great but you have to be a good self learner and explorer as it is very difficult to catch up with the speed of the course. The content they tell is not enough but is great for a self start.
1845,Brilliant course which introduces you to Pandas module. I am very eager to participate in follow-up courses.
1846,This course is very useful for those who have a little foundametion of python but not familiar. 
1847,"Introduction to Data Science in Python is good starter course helped me to introduce to lot of concepts needed for basic retrieval, cleaning and manipulating. But I thought teaching can be little more expanded to give more detailed information. Assignments were good, but some are little complicated for the starter. I appreciate Staffing team in helping to us in all possible ways with approach and expected behaviors, validation scripts etc. Thanks to all Staff."
1848,This course worked better as a guide than it did as a course. I learned very little from the lectures and had to do most of my learning on my own. One of the assignment even explicitly told students they would have to go learn on their own.
1849,good one
1850,"Excellent introductory course for data analysis in Python, specifically using Pandas library.I learnt a lot in a short time. Assignments are not easy to solve, they make you think hard, explore more on internet and on user forums, thus making you grasp the topics in depth. This is the best starter course for anyone seeking a career in Data Science using Python."
1851,"I appreciate this specialization's patience to begin teaching data science with such a thorough introduction to handling data in python. The lectures are concise, with 80-90% of my time time spent on the assignments. The creators of the course have a clear understanding that most of a data scientist's job is spent cleaning data, and it's incredibly important to get the practice offered by this course."
1852,Good class challenging but fun!
1853,"frankly, it takes a lot of searching information on one's own, outside of this course.I raked my brains for the most of Saturday and Sunday and finished two last assigments although I still don't feel strong in pandas, neither there is much material left here for me to come back and review something step by step in a systematic way. "
1854,Its a very good course to start learning for data analysis which can work as a foundation to learn more in data science and machine learning.
1855,Great course! Some of the homework questions seemed a little ambiguous but I was able to find clarification in the course discussion. All in all I learned a lot.
1856,"Very dense, well taught, examples and assignments help in the learning process, I've done many, many Coursera courses, this one in the Top5"
1857,This course is excellent for newbies in learning data science. It gives a comprehensive description about data science .
1858,a decent introduction into the world of python dataframes via the pandas library
1859,"Tasks sometimes a bit tacit to understand what exactly should we return and in what format, but course is great!"
1860,Great tutor and interactive build up from fundamentals to the very challenging concepts..
1861,Good course to get you thinking about python
1862,"Content was generally well covered. One improvement could have been slightly better examples of how there are multiple different ways to solve the same problems; the instructor would often allude to this but would just advise the student to read through the pandas docs, which could be non-intuitive at times."
1863,Very Good!
1864,Excelente. Va un poco m??s all??.
1865,"Very informative. Would be interested to see the correct way to complete many of the assignments, as I'm sure there are more elegant ways to complete them than I used"
1866,Nice course for beginners
1867,"Much harder than I thought. Very in-depth introductory learning of python.Preferably better if you allow scripting in .py because notebook is rather heavy and hard todebug while assignments..Hope you cover a bit more in detail with language structure, as well as give hints for solving assignments, since many parts were pretty above course level.I would say the assignments were hard even for an R practitioner learning python like myself."
1868,Good course the assignments were challenging
1869,Very good course with some challenging assignments that put to test many of my python capabilities
1870,Much more difficult assignments than taught in lectures
1871,The teach and assignment are not in line in difficulty levels.
1872,Excellent !!!
1873,This is a great course to learn about Data Science techniques. The profesors explains all the topics clearly
1874,Top course!
1875,"course material good, mentors very very helpful and active , as mentioned in one of the posts the expected output of an answer in pictorial form can help students a lot , and the assignments were a little on the tough side , even being from a programming background i had to put a lot of effort to figure out silly mistakes and complete this first course but a nice experience , keep it up coursera."
1876,Learning at its best through this course
1877,One of the most useful courses to start a career in the field of Data Science. The assignment were really challenging and interesting
1878,"Very difficult if you are unfamiliar with python, but achievable. Assignments can be frustrating to get just right for the autograder, but you learn important subtleties in the meantime. Cannot wait to complete the rest of the courses in this specialization!!"
1879,Assignment 4 is difficult to understand. 
1880,Very helpful for data analysis.
1881,Gave me a thorough understanding of Python and Data Science. Thanks to the team! :) 
1882,Nice course! Pushing you to practice and lert you act on your own to find accurate results.I thinks that this is the best way to learn if you want to start a career in Data Science
1883,This is an excellent course which should be taken when you want to practice Pandas!
1884,Good introduction to pyhton and data science
1885,Lectures are too fast!
1886,Unorganized and not very useful. The main goal of the course is for you to use Stack Overflow.....SAVE YOURSELF $
1887,Nice introductory course for using python in datascience
1888,Very Good Course
1889,Great introduction to data scientist!
1890,"In my opinion, the assignments problems could be more clearily explained, I think it could be improved for next sessions."
1891,Recommend this course to people new to Python and want to learn basic data science techniques quickly. Very inspiring lectures given by professor and very helpful instructions given by mentors and teaching assistant. 
1892,"Very poor course, badly taught and terrible value for money. The lessons are brief beyond any form of reasonableness, the teacher seems completely unconnected with his students. There is no detail at all and no logical progression. I took and passed this course with a view to doing the specialisation but I'm not going to waste any more money on University of Michigan courses. I've found similar courses on other platforms which cover the same material. The assignments were awful, in some cases they covered material to be presented the following week, in others the questions were wrongly stated and did not match the output from the machine grading. The machine grading itself gave you no clue as to where you went wrong. I'm not talking about the odd question here or there, I'm talking about consistently throughout every assignment. I don't normally, in fact ever, leave bad reviews, I usually just chalk it up to experience and move on but in this case, the course was so bad, I had to say something. I've done two other courses on Coursera with Rice University and the difference to this course is huge, while I would wholeheartedly recommend the Rice Intro to Python courses, Don't do this course, it is not coherently presented or graded. The mentors in the forum tried their best but even they had to admit the grading system was riddled with errors. Absolute rubbish, avoid and spend your money elsewhere."
1893,Super useful!
1894,A worthy course to begin Python &amp; Data Science with. I enjoyed learning Data Science in Python.
1895,Nice Course.... it makes me a little bit stressed cause same bug and other. But I'M REALLY ENJOY this course. Can't wait next course in this series. :)
1896,"Definitely one of the best course I have taken so far.The course started with refreshing the python basics and then it's a deep dive in to the ocean of Data Cleaning tasks.Special Thanks to Dr Brooks for keeping the course straight forward and simple. All the concepts are made very clear during lecture and the assignments are a perfect application of these concepts.Even though assignments are challenging, will feel the sense of accomplishment on completing these.Thanks to the entire course team for the course. "
1897,Excellent.
1898,Lectures are very informative. Liked assignments because they were opened enough to seek for a new information by yourself - that's a thing everyone must improve.
1899,"I got the opportunity of learning Python Basics through Dr Chunk's Python for Every Body, Now through this course I got the hands on experience of working with Data in Python using NumPy and Pandas, ya Its awsome journey overall. Thanks Coursera and University of Michigan for bringing us such a great Learning opportunity."
1900,"Learned so much for this course. Very intensive and challenging, but also a lot of fun."
1901,very intersting course in which you can learn many thing about cleaning data etc
1902,This is the good course for learning data science
1903,very nice 
1904,"Very good course, forces to do a lot of self study."
1905,Pretty good
1906,"Sometimes need more words in tasks, so it can help understand it better."
1907,More programming details should be included. 
1908,"The course is a great course in terms of the knowledge and experience of the instructor and the helpfulness of the staff. I gave it 2 stars for two reasons.1) The videos are deceptively short. In MOOC instructional design, you normally design short videos because the attention span of an online learner is tends to be much shorter than an in-person university student. However, in this course, even though the video is short, it is really 5-10 times longer because they speed over the equations and teaching so fast that you have to pause and replay and rewind and replay several times while trying it yourself. So the timings are not truly accurate. If you were actually teaching it in a classroom with actual students you would go much more slowly. In this case, I wish they were more honest with the times by actually typing the code in real time while teaching. I would have preferred a lecture to make it more digestible.2) The hardest thing for me about the course was the fact that instead of practicing computational thinking within data science (decomposition, algorithmic thinking, etc.), I was really just searching on stack overflow for how to put it into python. It's poor instructional design to only teach somethings and expect students to complete assignments without giving them all the tools they will use in the assignment. It would be ok if it were an accidental mistake, but this seems to be purposeful. This happened not just in course assignments but sometimes even in mid-roll video-overlaid quizzes where the answer was something not explained or taught or shown. This was really strange to me and caused a huge amount of time to be spent searching online or trying mid-lecture problems to no avail. It cause all the timings of the course to be off (#1 caused the video timings to be severely off and #2 meant that the course assignment estimates were HUGELY miscalculated). Good instructional design would mean that the professor should show all the tools one could use to faithfully complete and achieve the assignment. For some reason that was avoided again and again in this course.Great material though. I loved learning. I just wish it were better structured and supported and that I learned more about the work rather than just searching online for how to write something."
1909,This is a good course if you have had some experience with the Pandas module in Python prior to taking the course. Pandas is a very powerful module but it has a fairly significant learning curve. There are all sorts of free Pandas tutorials available on the web. I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the basics of Pandas prior to taking this course or you will probably struggle. 
1910,"This class was super useful. I had a minimal amount of base Python under my belt and some data analysis in R, but this course really got me off the ground using the pandas data analysis library for Python and Jupyter notebooks."
1911,"Solid explanations of the basics of python and pandas. Strong emphasis on self-learning in assignments, which may be difficult for those without background in programming."
1912,"Thanks for the course. A few things that can be improved:1- The video material was very short. I expected same amount of teaching like homework, but it's more like 30 minutes versus 7 hours every week. As a result it's mostly googling and copy-pasting code, which I'm very sceptical if solving issues this way will enter my long-term memory. Probably next time I will need to look it up again. I'd prefer if the videos were the source of knowledge instead of stack overflow and the forum.2 - As an experienced programmer but being new to Python I found it difficult to load the data. I was not aware that the files are available on the server and can just be loaded by read_csv(filename.csv). Instead I tried to load the files from my local drive, which worked, but not for the grader. Then I tried to submit it offline which also failed. I wasted half a day on this. I suggest to mention quickly how the online and offline assignments work, in particular in how to load data.3 - The feedback from the grader is usually not telling much. It was often unclear to me what was the expected outcome. I think a screenshot of the expected answer for the more advanced questions (first few rows+columns) would help a lot and save us a lot of suffering. "
1913,great course for a start! at the end its all about how you practice from what you leanred
1914,"hard assignments, lecture was not enough to cover assignments."
1915,Amazing course. Really easy to follow along as long as you put the work in and study you'll be fine!
1916,"Unclear assignments, lectures are brief and sometimes unclear. Spent more time trying to understand what was being asked than actually learning."
1917,Very good lecture.
1918,I really liked the course and how it introduces Python to beginners. Kudos to Coursera and University of Michigan!
1919,"For me the course's biggest value-adding point is to simply ask us to Google everything on Stack Overflow to complete all the assignments, which has almost nothing to do with the course content. The assignments are also badly designed. In the discussion forum you can see lots of confused / frustrated posts. The TA's and mentors are clearly under-resourced to answer all our questions. The videos unfortunately don't teach us much either. The professor + TA's a simply reading off a teleprompter, and they're rushing through everything. I've done some amazing courses on Python also offered from Uni. of Chicago, but this course has been a big disappointment unfortunately..."
1920,This course is a joke. Contents is very very poor. And you will have a lot of problems making the Assigments.
1921,"Hope that lecture videos could be longer. Anyway, it is a great course, I really learned a lot."
1922,It was a great learning experience.
1923,The video classes are informative and very clear. The exercises during the classes were thorough and allowed me to apprehend the concepts at a good pace. My only problem were the auto-graded exams. Sometimes the questions are not crystal clear and the auto-grader isn't intelligent enough to discern between a logical mistake and some detail about table formatting. Fortunately these problems are discussed in the forums and usually one can get clues on what they can be from the mentors.
1924,"A very challenging course. The assignments are the best part of the course and it takes up a lot of time and patience to complete them. The discussion forum is fairly engaging and the mentors are very responsive. Overall, this course is a big boost in the field of Data science"
1925,"Excellent overview of the topic. Lectures are well delivered, if a bit terse. Assignments are well designed, and the mentors in the discussion forums are very helpful."
1926,The content is good
1927,Lecture content need much more coverage. 
1928,"Great course and valuable information, but frustrating autograder."
1929,Please provide more lectures. We depend on self-learning more than lectures in order to pass.
1930,Good and necessary introduction to Python. But especially Assignement 3 regarding cleaning the data should be improved. It??s good to know how to clean the data but it??s confusing when Q1 is apparently correct but actually it??s not. Mabye it would be better that Q2 - Q13 based on a new dataframe which is correctly by all means.
1931,Very well designed course for Data Science beginners
1932,"The course content is great. However, basic knowledge of python programming language is required. Since I didn't know python coding rules, I really struggled for a while. Maybe, basics of python in additional resources will help a lot of learners."
1933,cool course
1934,"I feel the videos could have been more instructive.However, the level of assignments is incredible! I learnt a lot more from programming assignments of this course than videos."
1935,I would like to have seen more detailed teaching on Hypothesis testing and how it applies to python before tackling the final project.
1936,Awesome course for those who want to kick start a data science career. 
1937,Will be useful to take the Phyton Cpurse before this one. You only learn when you do the assignments.
1938,"The Assignments are really tough and need a lot of self study. However, If you are a person who learns by doing projects this course is the one."
1939,"I learned so much. However, the lack of support when I got stuck made it a frustrating experience. I would not have been able to pass without the discussion forum tips. Even then, it was a lot of mucking in the dark and assignments took longer to complete than they should have. I'm glad I took the course but it was not designed for someone at my skill level. If the discussion forum was organized in a better way, it would have helped -- I had to scroll through pages of text to find the right tips to identify my mistakes. Sometimes the question requirements were oddly or ambiguously phrased and I misunderstood the expectation for the function being tested."
1940,really interesting course and professors are great
1941,Nice course about pandas.
1942,"I really enjoyed this challenging introductory course, I cannot wait to continue the specialization"
1943,Difficult. I cannot recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people. 
1944,This course relies almost exclusively on self learning of the details of pandas. It would be greatly improved by examples of how to use pandas to solve problems similar to the assignments.
1945,Thoroughly enjoyed. It was set at a good level ??? enough was left in the assignments so they felt like an actual accomplishment.
1946,"Great introductory course to python. Decent novice-level videos but great assignment quality. Definitely takes up more time than expected, especially if you aren't well-versed with python syntax."
1947,"requires too much self-learning,could be overwhelming to those who lack concrete python basics"
1948,"Good course, challenging as well."
1949,"Very well designed course , it compels students to go in-depth for assignment work.Very helpful Teaching staff as well"
1950,"As a python newbie, I found this course challenging yet so much fun to learn. Dr. Brooks presented the lectures in a very organized way and made them easy to follow. If you have experience in R, you probably would pick up Pandas real quick. Students are expected to devote a lot of time into the assignments and try to find the answer on your own. But with all the great tips and clarifications from our diligent mentor Sophie Greene, it's definitely achievable.Will take the other courses in this specialization and definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested in data analysis."
1951,"Learning this course gave me confidence and more interest in exploring data science, I plan to explore further through the next couple of courses."
1952,I enjoyed the way the Professor presents the concepts with real and interesting examples. The exercises during the presentation was an extra motivation. And I appreciated that each assignment was well selected with real data. The mentors and staff in the discussion 
1953,Awesome Course
1954,Excellent!
1955,"Although, i had some basic knowledge of data science before and also i did some programming in python, yet i find this course comprehensive and practical."
1956,"Felt like this course was trying to pack a lot of information into only four weeks. I find Python to be a very frustrating language - at least that's how Pandas feels. Compared to R the syntax is dreadful. And I found myself digging through help files and FAQs to find ways to do what should be the simplest things - like accessing values in a data frame. The Pandas help documents are not written for beginners, but written in a mathematically precise manner that makes them inaccessible. (Their preference for 1-letter variable names is unhelpful.) Stack Overflow is much better but it's a crap shoot as to whether somebody has addressed the exact issue that is bothering me at any given point. One final issue: it would be nice to see model solutions. I understand the difficulty in having online solutions available for an online course, but I found myself writing what I considered to be inefficient code fairly often. Would love to see slicker ways to do these tasks."
1957,Very good course
1958,"This course is difficult. It stresses a lot of core skills in pandas and python. I wish there was more instructor support for the times that code just doesn't seem to match up with the grader's expectations. There is still a question in the course that I am relatively positive I answered correctly yet did not receive credit. Overall, the format is incredibly well done and the use of Jupyter notebooks makes the tasks very approachable. "
1959,"Great intro to data science and some of Python libraries for it.The exercises can be quite difficult, especially if you expect to have all the answers given to you during the lessons. In order to solve some of them you have to search the web to find the commands you need, which I think is a good thing because it teaches an approach useful in real scenarios."
1960,Thank you for the very elaborate and very beginner's course. The difficulty quickly ramps up and the questions within an assignment often differs substantially. This can be seen as both a pro and a con. 
1961,it is a 5 star course but I am giving it a 4 star primarily because of the pace was very very fast for me... 
1962,"Great material and presentation! Please work on question clarity, especially in the last project. With as picky as the grader is a little extra specificity would have saved me a few false starts."
1963,"Excellent pandas course. The exercises were extremely challenging, but helped me hone my pandas syntax a lot. Definitely worth the time if you're interested in becoming a business intelligence analyst or engineer."
1964,"Some topics are very difficult since many of the concepts are outside of what was thought in the lectures so one has to do a lot of research outside of the website. This takes up a lot of time and is way more than the estimated time for each part of the course. I did find excellent help available on the forum. Overall, a very challenging yet fun course."
1965,"This course is very challenging but worthwhile. Having experiences in data analysis with python, I still feel the assignments are really hard to complete. BUT it is really worthwhile, and I improved my skills in python A LOT! The auto-graded system is AWESOME! I sincerely recommend this course and really appreciate the work of the teaching staff!"
1966,"Great Course,very practical. I would improve the examples and increase the number of exercise during the lectures instead of just fastly presenting the pandas functionalities."
1967,?? ???????????????? ???????????????? ?? ???????????????? ???????????? ?? ?????????????????????????? Python.
1968,A very interesting and useful course for those who want to learn how to clean data in Python.I loved the opportunity to work directly on the notebook as I was listening to lectures.I think that more emphasis should have been put in the pros and cons why and how of using the pandas lib. functions in order to accomplish tasks.Assignments were very instructive and well explained by staff in the Discussion ForumMany thanks to the staff and to U. of Michigan for the course. 
1969,The course lessons could have been more specific and provide more explanations on many topics that are later required in the assignments
1970,Fast-paced course requiring time to finish - but totally worth it!
1971,"The whole curse relies on the automated grading system, which is still a little sloppy. I think it would be useful to have one notebook or cheatsheet with all the important functions. And also, I personally like to have a reference assignment that was completed by the instructors. This could be provided before or after the course, but the way I really learn is by reading other peoples code and seeing ways to code problems. Thanks"
1972,Fantastic course with challenging assignments. Wish there were more handouts to explain some of the key concepts and the grader was better informative of the errors.
1973,Great course!! I've enjoyed the assignments very much - from my part it required a a lot of individual investigation / reading through posts to find possible solutions but that's only fair since this is an intermediate course. It was a fantastic experience as the assignments felt like real projects. Thanks for everyone making this course possible! Daniel 
1974,The course instructor could have been more elaborate with the examples. I felt there was a wide gap between the exercises and the course material.
1975,"the knowledge touch here is really good. however, the speed is a little bit quick. I paused and go back and forth usually. the last introduction of assignment 4 is not clear. I took quite a long time to figure what to use to calculate the price ratio and what to use to run ttest."
1976,I really enjoyed this course. For me it was'n easy at all but I still say that you find the right way to help the students without make the assignments pointless. Thank you so much for this great learning opportunity!
1977,A must do course for budding data scientists
1978,Great introduction to the world of data science. Instructor does a great job of explaining the content with easy to follow examples. I highly recommend taking the course
1979,I really enjoyed the experience. The videos are precise and give examples for the materials discussed. However it feels a bit sparse on the overall length. On the other hand the exercises test the knowledge acquired through the course and self learning.
1980,the content was more focused on just pandas librarycouldve included matplotlib and scipy also
1981,Excellent introduction to data science with python. Thank you
1982,"I overthought some of the homework (the forums will tell you to not do that) and wasted much time going a bit too far cleaning data, however my own hubris aside, it was a good course. I've been working in NNs for some time, but wanted to use more formal data science tools on top of that and add something to my CV. I wish these tools had been around when I was in grad school... le sigh."
1983,"Honestly, it was a good crash course into data science in python. My 3/5 star rating comes from the fact that I think their could be more content / examples shown in the videos. The videos were a good start into the assignments, but I had to spend hours reading on the internet to really understand enough to complete the course.I liked what I saw in the videos, just wish there was a little more substance."
1984,"This python is mostly an introduction to the Python Pandas API. It teaches everything by example, but at very fast pace, and the videos are really just preparations for the assignments, which can easily take more time than specified. "
1985,right course. 
1986,"The submission tasks are too time consuming. In the other hand,forces the student to search about answers by themselves and use the techniques taught on it's full extension."
1987,"A bit short, but good info. I wish you got access to an optimal code for each of the assignments once you submit yours and pass, so you could see how you can improve."
1988,"The course was a very efficient intro to using Python to get data from various simple sources and the different structures that can be used to hold and manipulate the data. The course starts with the intuitive methods to solve problems and then introduces more complex and process friendly alternatives to demonstrate how creativity and knowledge of Python can be used to generate elegant and efficient code. The auto-grading of assignments can be a little maddening as the correct answer needs to be formatted precisely as is expected or else it will be counted as incorrect. The good thing here is that it forces you to fully understand the data types and data, the bad is it can be frustrating not knowing if the answer is wrong or just the format of the answer. Admittedly, I feel this effort forced me to become a better Python programmer."
1989,"Great course, requires much self-initiative because not all useful methods for the assignments are covered in the videos. Sometimes Assignment Questions are not described very clearly.All in all I enjoyed the course very much :)"
1990,Not for beginners. Level of difficulty increase very fast.You need to dig external reference sites and use discussion forums in order to figure out some assignments requirements.Overall quality is very good.Should have some better tips and validation scripts in order to help debugging assignments.
1991,"Very good introduction to Pandas Series and DataFrames for Data Science. Fast paced course with good supplementary materials. The homework is progressively challenging. Sophie the Teaching Assistant is particularly helpful in the forums. I don't recommend this course for those without programming or python scripting experience. Also, the homework exercises took me significantly longer than the estimates projected, but I budgeted about double the time and was able to complete the course on time."
1992,"Only 37 minutes of video, average per week. Really nice, pleasant video, but don't expect to learn how to solve the problems, because there is little connection from the problems to the videos.Teaching assistants are hard -working and knowledgable and each has a different way to do things.Very little in the way of effective educational design.But they do create useful questions to answer, if you are stubborn enough not to need actual instruction.The estimate of time required is woefully inadequate.The best thing you can do is lookup Brandon Rhodes on Youtube. He will actually explain Pandas. Expect to invest about four hours in his videos and still have questions. Use the course forum extensively ??? only there will you get a hint of how to do what they ask.Google and Stack Overflow: that's their extensive list of references."
1993,This course was really worth paying!!!Thank you for providing this course!
1994,"I found that the videos weren't entirely helpful when tackling the assignments. I had to outsource most, if not all, of my inquiries to external sources (read: stack overflow). Even simple things such as advanced indexing, such as multi-indexing, was unclear. I understand that not everything can be covered, but I feel that basic things should be. Other than that, I enjoyed using the Jupyter notebook, and thought this was integrated very nicely into the coursework."
1995,"The course was helpful in presenting typical problems in data science, but the lectures showed you examples in one area of pandas and the assignments asked questions in different areas of pandas. I found the assignments frustrating and spent much of my time trying to understand what they were asking rather than actually solving the problems."
1996,Excellent course. It really motivated me to work very hard to make all assignments on time
1997,"I enjoyed and found all of the lectures helpful, but lack of feedback after submitting assignments was a real problem, especially for the last assignment. A simple response of this was answered incorrectly, points not awarded isn't very constructive and was often frustrating. Bugs in being able to submit the assignment were also frustrating. I spent a good amount of time trying to fix my code, thinking it was incorrect, when in actuality the online submission was just not working."
1998,"The course content and assignments are pretty good at covering the fundamentals of how to manipulate data in python, I did learn a lot that I can see my self applying practically. Where it falls down though is the assignment auto-grader. It's immensely fussy (as I understand it has to be), but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don't sufficiently explicitly define whats expected. This means you spend more than 50% of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so.I would recommend this course, but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future."
1999,"An excellent course, though I think some of the assignments should be a little more guided"
2000,"From my poitn of view more lessons are needed, achieving exercises require a deep search on stackoverflow and other courses. That shouldn??t be the goal of the course, I expected the lessons to give enough knowledge to fullfil the questions of the exams"
2001,Is challenging and you learn about a bunch of different aspects of pandas. Never forget to take notes about what you are learning and review them later.
2002,"Great course in hands-on experience with Python on data analytics. Before the class, I took a intro class to Python in my school covering basic commands, and thought this Coursera course would be kind of easy. But it turned out to be a very intensive one. I take more than 6 hours to complete the homework."
2003,It's a great course! The assignment is amazing! It takes me several hours or even one or two days to finish it. I have to say the assignment is really valuable. Professor Brook is also great and the video is greatly filmed. It's worth taking if you have already learned some of python and want to know more about python in data analysis. I have already learned the book Learn Python the Hard Way and played with python for a while before I take this course. 
2004,Very helpful for beginners who wants to learn Data Science with Python. Will recommend to go with this course. Thank you team for giving nice teaching. Very Grateful :)
2005,Perfect to get hands on with python programming for data science purposes.
2006,"Challenging assignments, clear and concise explanations, learned a ton!"
2007,great
2008,"This is an amazing course. The teacher (Chris) is fantastic, extremely clear and a pleasure to listen his classes."
2009,Great course. You should really work hard to pass all the assignments. Tons of practical expirience in pandas. Looking forward for the next courses.
2010,Fantastic course. Quite challenging but it is really worth for people looking to learn python and some of the key concepts in data science. I definitely will continue with the following python courses part of the specialization
2011,Good intro to Pandas and assignments are well designed
2012,Good lecturers and interactive videos 
2013,"While the course was great, the Jupyter notebooks and the background shells gave me several unnecessary errors. While this was a smaller issue, I think the practice Notebooks should be somewhat in line with the assignments. I struggles on Assignment #3. "
2014,"It is an interesting course. After taking this course, I can make use of Pandas, numpy in python. In addition, I have learned some interesting knowledge about statistic. Thanks Prof. Christopher Brooks and TAs. "
2015,"Very good class - but it does require quite a bit of outside study - reading up on stackoverflow. But after this class, the student will be able to have a very hand set of tools/skills to tackle datascience projects. BTW, python with the interactive notebook is very popular in actual datascience projects in the commercial sphere, so this class can be leveraged directly in the real world"
2016,Great introduction to Pandas.
2017,This course was fast paced but the material was interesting and not to complex. I can only recommend this course to anyone interested in Data Science and who already has a basic knowledge of Python.
2018,"The course was structured well, there were a lot of assignments that really help with learning pandas. The lectures were ok, could've been a bit longer though."
2019,"I took sometime to get used to the auto grader, but after that it's fine. All the staffs are very helpful in clarifying the questions and provide code to debug my codes. It was awesome!"
2020,"Really amazing course, I leaned a lot about pandas, how to manage and clean data and extract value out of that. I've learned a little about statistics, specially hypothesis testing."
2021,Very good and practical course. Challenging and enjoyable assessments. Thank you very much indeed. 
2022,"The course is fast paced and the videos do not cover all of what is necessary to know to pass the assignments. However, this is not a problem as all the necessary references are given. The problem is the way the programming assignments are designed and the automatic grader, which should definitely be improved. Some times you spend hours to figure out what is wrong and you finally find out that you have a precision error because of using a library function instead of another (same purpose) or you spend our to manipulate a Pandas dataframe to respond to the specifications, except that all that time is wasted as the grader will accept the first version even if the index does not respond to the requirement (for instance). So, if you want to take it, prepare to fight with the grader. Positive point: Excellent help on the forums, you will not be left alone. "
2023,"The course is very good and very demanding. But the assignments estimation time were, for me, really completely out. I used much more than 3 more times the suggested ones."
2024,The course's content is great but the fact that we have to search by our self's for the tests was the best for me.
2025,"Great Course! I learn a lot about Python, Pandas and other areas. Looking forward to taking the next courses."
2026,Nice course. I really liked how I could proceed at my own pace. The computer-graded assignments were very helpful and the Forums were good sources of info.
2027,"This course has greatly helped my understanding of not only some python, but pandas as well. My only suggestion to anyone that wants to take this course is to make sure to allocate as much time as possible to it. They give estimates as to how long it should take you to complete a week's worth of material, but this can vary highly from person to person. Overall, I enjoyed!"
2028,"I do have background in OOP programming but not Python. But I do also programming in MATLAB. I chose this course to learn more about technical skills to do research in data mining, data science, and machine learning. The instructor is fine but the lecture note is not really helpful. Students need more clear written information than just lecturing in Video as referring to lecture notes as needed would be more efficient. Each week assigns one programming assignment consisting of multiple problems. I don't think the shown expected time to complete each assignment is totally unrealistic. It took tremendous time to complete and at least to pass it. One good thing is that as far as you complete it within the session, there is no penalty and you can get the passing scores. However, all the programming is graded by the autograder which has a lot of bugs. For example, the exactly same solutions that was passed by the autograder as correct previously are graded as incorrect in the next trial. The staff people try to help but I totally don't understand their approach in that 'this may help but I am not sure if the autograder can accept it'. I believe they try to fix the bugs and use the 'trustworthy' autograder so students can rely on the feedback provided the autograder. We are not learning how to make the autograder not generate errors. I believe many of students are taking this course to improve their career performance. In my case, I am working as a full-time while I am taking this course. Due to the lack of time and the inefficient/faulty autograder, I took a lot of my precious time. I got passed this course with 95 and will continue taking the rest of the courses in this specialization because I already paid the whole specialization package and supported by my company. But I believe the staff team should improve the technical aspects so students can save a lot of their time. Also many of the programming problems do not have the sufficient level of clarity. For each problem, there should be an example so students do not have to spend too much time to understand or guess the solution. I found many inconsistency in the solutions although I guessed it by spending a lot of time to pass this course."
2029,"Challenging, awesome. Working through the assignments will really teach you Pandas, which makes Python scripts much more efficient. I'm already using the things I have learned at work."
2030,"Course lectures were good, tho at times a little too rapid. The python text appears and disappears too fast to digest, I did a lot of pausing. The early exercises were good, but later ones were finicky. I would prefer more intermediate steps to confirm we're on the right track. In particular the last (huge) exercise was frustrating, just being told I've got it wrong with no feedback on why. "
2031,"This course would be great if you are experienced in Python or any other programming language. The title ' Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required.' is very misleading and if you do not have any experience, you will struggle a lot especially to complete week 3 &amp; 4 assignments. It makes you think and requires a lot of self-study, which is a good way to enhance our knowledge and skills, however assignments are way too challenging for those who are 'beginners' or have little real-world experience. I would not recommend if you do not have much confidence in your programming 'experience'.Having said that, teaching team is great - very knowledgeable and supportive. "
2032,I would recommend the coursera online training session need more improvement. Please look at this youtube video. this will give you some fair idea what do i mean. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0AWyzVMf54During the session speaker need to be visible on top corner and they need to present with more examples during learning this will help and learn fast. I struggled a bit following your videos going back-and-forth with the given materials.I also struggled solving the assignment due to confusing questions. Not much clear what is required to solve the problem. it would be helpful to provide some hints for each assignment. 
2033,Fantastic overview and support 
2034,"Overall this was a great class. The programming assignments were the most valuable part of the course for me and were good practice for wrangling data with pandas. I did find some of the assignments asked questions in a way that were confusing and it was difficult to debug the answer based on the automatic grader. However, I'm looking forward to when the rest of the specialization is available, as this looks like a good track!"
2035,Very Useful and practical
2036,"The course is very good to introduce people with pandas usage, however, the autograder and little data issues on the assignments costs a lot of learning time."
2037,"In my humble opinion, the Python ramp-up in week 1 is not sufficient to effectively complete weeks 2-4. This course necessitates a bit more practice in Python. The lectures are cut-and-dry, and I recommend frequently referencing them when completing the assignments. I spent about 1.5x the listed time-to-complete on most assignments. On the flip side, I gained a lot of knowledge by putting forth full effort."
2038,Very good content. Challenging assignment that force you to learn more yourself rather than just apply what you've heard and forget it in 10 minutes. 
2039,Please make longer tutorial videos. Sometimes it becomes too fast to cope up with.
2040,great course!!
2041,"The course is great and learned a lot from the assignment! I just feel some of the content is a little beyond me since it took a lot of time to finish. After finishing the assignment, I feel myself haven't done enough! So if possible, I hope more exercise can be posted here :)"
2042,Nice course for understanding the basics
2043,"Course is very self-directed. There are very few exercises, and there is minimal feedback on those exercises. No attempt is made to reinforce learned knowledge over time (e.g. spaced repetition) nor is there any definitive list for what knowledge should be gleaned from this course. Emphasis is placed on the student's teaching themselves and learning through experience with no attempt to actually understand the learning process or rest the course design on a scientific basis. Standard filler course for an empty education system."
2044,Overall a very nice introduction to Python. Sometimes the checks for the assignments were a little annoying. It would be way easier if all the checks would be published from the outset.
2045,"Congratulations, folks! This course is amazing! I learned *a lot* on it! =]"
2046,Excellent material.
2047,Course is good. I learned a lot. But the pace of teaching is very fast.
2048,Assignment time estimations were way off in my opinion.
2049,Thank you once again Courser and Team for their generous contribution towards students across globe. The teachers and courses mentors specially Sophie who was awesome during the assignment for her nice clarification. This course was challenging but fun. 
2050,"Overall, this course is tough for me. In my opinion, the course title is not suitable, which is introduction. The word introduction generally means something basic and fundamental. However, the level programming assignments in this course is between slightly medium and very hard. Furthermore, the assignment instructions are not clear enough, i.e. what steps need to be followed to complete each question. So, it needs time for me to find the way or solution in the discussion forum. I know in each week forum, there is one discussion specifically for assignment (i.e. Assignment X Tips), which is good. But, I think the forum is not a good place, since we have to find it meticulously the information and what we want to find is spread out, not in an easy to follow order.Moreover, I do not think the lectures and the assignments are well synchronized as there are many things in assignments that are outside from the lectures. I mean, it is too many new things in the assignment. Although it is a great way for the students to search and enhance their skills by themselves, in general, the assignments should at least reflect the lectures.Lastly, in my humble opinion, this course is not appropriate for someone who is new to programming and has not been familiar or mastered any programming languages, though the title is introduction."
2051,Don't think this should be classified as Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required. Need at least some coding experience. 
2052,"Very well structured course. I would really appreciate if there are more video lectures. For someone like who is not from CS background, self-study topics can get really difficult.Apart from that loved it."
2053,Great course for beginner in data science
2054,"please provide the complete 5 unit details . I could see only this unit is open for past many months. I paid for all 5 unit money already and not in a position revert back and get the money. Could you please help me out to understand when this courses will be available if not in near future , why are they taken money before the course is not ready to us. Quite disappointing experience."
2055,Hard to do
2056,"Very rewarding course. As many others have mentioned, the learning curve in the assignments is steep and the time estimate of 4 hours/week is unrealistically short. It took me about three days of full-time work to finish the course. Great into to working with data structures in pandas, data cleaning and basic statistical tests in python."
2057,Was good but the support in the forums could be better.
2058,"Basically assignments were unclear (I had to do lots of resubmissions), but everything else was fine."
2059,Very interesting subject and data science skills are definitely currently in demand. The only thing that bugged me was that the grader didn't give much feedback on anything you did wrong. On the flip side the mentors did a GREAT job (kudos to you guys). The discussion forums were vital and they were really well moderated. 
2060,"Nice course! there is only one suggestion I want to send you, the video is so short that we can not learn the pandas more in the course. So I hope you can provide more detailed videos thanks. "
2061,"This is very helpful course, my skills horned after undergoing through this sessions. My expertise and style of using python for data analysis changed. Articles and group discussions about P-hacking made me to realize the pitfalls, I may enter once I get addicted to proving my hypothesis correct. I got an idea, what better I can understand; when data speaks. I am waiting for next module of this course. Please start it as possible."
2062,"This course taught ma Pandas and Hypothesis test, which are very useful in my study and future work. For example, I learned how to sort values, merge tables, and reset indexes. And most parts is like SQL.Lectures will give some basic knowledge of the contents for each week. And this course also provide enough related documents, including codes and slides in classes. And it also has subtitle, which helps me a lot for my understanding.When I was doing assignment, I still need to search more information from internet and learn by myself. I think this is a great way to help me know how to solve problems by myself. I think it is also a little bit challenging for a beginner, so I suggest beginner to learn some basic knowledge before taking this course. "
2063,Perfect courses! With a lot of opportunities to practice and to learn from do questions by yourself. Mentors and staffs are also kindly to answer problems. 
2064,"Good introduction of working with tabular data in Pandas dataframes. I've learnt how to access columns, rows, and specific values in a dataframe. How to transform the data. And how to merge dataframes together. The assignments are a lot of do-it-yourself by reading documentation and Q&amp;A sites. So you're forced to read a lot, and learn more than actually necessary. Teacher and mentors gave hints on the discussion forum which helped. Could have been better if part of the solution is given. E.g. answer = 0.0073.........64 without actually giving the full answer. I also think the automatic grader should give an explanation or example of a correct answer when the assignment is answered correctly. It would have been better that way, because I could review the strengths and weaknesses of the methods I used to get to the answer. "
2065,Really good introductory course to Pandas. Teaching stuff was a big help and forums are very active and informative. Very good work. Area of improvement: The estimated timings of completion are too optimistic :)
2066,The duration of the course (4 weeks) was ideal. It was manageable as a part time course. The tests helped me a lot to practice and learn the concepts deeply. The forums were very helpful in clarifying the questions. The video quality was great.Many thanks for this great course which is made available online for free for all the world.
2067,Helpful
2068,This course will be a great start for people to know about data science with python and get familiar with few simple data.
2069,"I certainly learnt a lot through this course. The hands on oriented approach of this course works wonders for those who intend to dig deeper and improve their Python programming. The lectures are crisp and clear, but the main learning happens while doing the weekly assignments. Each assignment forces us to go search for content beyond what has been taught in the lectures and in this process we find new things. Also, the lecturer informed us about some good reference books for individual learning. I look forward to taking part two of this course. The mentors in the discussions forum are quite active and helpful. The forum was of big help to me for clearing the assignments. The only flaw I found was that the autograder does not clearly define our mistakes and that's where the mentors come in and explain in the discussion forum. This part could be better automated. Finally, I believe that a prior introduction to Python programming is an essential prerequisite to this course."
2070,The assignments were challenging and cool. Lot of self-study needed to crack them. The lecture videos could have been a bit more interesting.
2071,"I have struggled a lot during this course to complete the assignments. It is hard, it is well taught and you learn a lot!"
2072,"The lecturer is excellent, the forums are active and useful and the exercises are a good mixture of challenging and enjoyable. A very good course overall."
2073,The course material is very short and precise. Previous knowledge of Python is helpful. This course serves its purpose as an introduction to Python libraries and how they are used in the field of Data Science. 
2074,This course was over all okay. My primary complaints are that I felt that the class moved too quickly and relied too heavily on students to teach themselves through the Pandas documentation. The Pandas documentation is really only so-so and it would have been nice to have more guidance through the course materials.
2075,"Very nice Course, You will Learn about how to effectively use Pandas Library for Python and how to treat DataFrames in that ambient, there are nice functions and methods for parsing. The Course is very fast pace, I only have time on the weekends (some of those), so I had to switch dates two times. Also, some materials are very fast, so If you are new in Python, got to be sure if you have mastered prior concepts of the course (Week 2 depends on week 1 and so on ...). A large part of the course involves your own research in Python Docs and StackOverFlow page. As I am an R user, some things are intuitive (and maybe more easier for me to do in R), several of the things in comparison I thought: Wow, but this is so much easier on R, but at other times I saw the power of Python for parsing tasks or webdata that in the R require too much memory or are more complicated to obtain. R have the problem to treat everything like an object and guided by vectors, but at some parts that makes understand coding details more deeply, at least for me. I still think that the documentation of R the best there is for my purposes, so I will stick with that, but it's great to know how to develop some things in Python, mainly because of my goal of getting some applications to end users. Finally, not much related to the course, but maybe with the change in the platform of the Coursera, the forums seemed a little more confusing and a little more slower than former courses that I took, I think it might have to do with the same course running in parallel on different dates."
2076,"The course content is great - Prof Christopher seriously made justice to the content. He is great instructor. He has presented course in right manner, with right speed. Looking for more courses from Him. "
2077,"I learnt a lot, and enjoyed the process! It was more engaging than I expected of an online course. Excited to go forward with the specialization."
2078,"All the ingredients are there, but it would be nice to have more hand-holding given the ramp-up in difficulty in only a few weeks."
2079,It was very hard but extremly learnful.
2080,One of the best Courses I have done online. Took me back to basics and gave the best possible introduction to python which was beyond my expectations
2081,"Excellent course and lot to learn, one of the best data analysis toolkit available."
2082,"The course lectures were subpar and didn't cover the material in the assignments. Googling for answers and checking stackoverflow for code is a great way to get tips, but it doesn't teach you the core material. I would have rather had links to supplemental readings that the materials were based on. I would not recommend this course as an introduction course unless you've had significant experience with Python data structures and know how to work with lists, dataframes, and iterate over those. "
2083,Thanks a lot for your work. It's a great course for data sciense in python!
2084,"A lot of the harder questions were unclear or not covered by the course. Many were passed onto look this up yourself, which is fine, but sometimes a different approach resulted in a slightly different answer marked as wrong. The group_by stuff was especially tricky, as it was unlike its SQL counterpart and could have used a better example, eg with a function to split into quarters or group columns. Other than that, very interesting overall and very neat datasets. I would encourage having students check out kaggle.com for extra credit."
2085,"Really good course with challenging assignments. However, the grader has some issues, for every assignment I had to spend more time trying to figure out how to make the grader accept my answers than actually solving the problems."
2086,The assignments were very well made and the discussion forums were also very well moderated. I will highly recommend this to any of my peers who are interested.
2087,The material seemed a bit hurried at times..but overall a great learning experience and the assignments were truly helpful
2088,Great Course!
2089,"Two stars because I have found poor explanations of assignments. I finished the course without being very clear what I was asked, and I lacked more feedback when one of the tasks is wrong. The teacher and the videos are very good."
2090,Excellent course in one word
2091,"Good course, if a bit fast paced, expect a great deal of searching through documentation and stackoverflow, but it is to be expected from an intermediate level course."
2092,I never thought this Data Science course was going to be that challenging and exciting at the same time. I have really enjoyed this first course and I am about to enroll for the coming courses. Well explained concepts and very comprehensive videos. Congrats!
2093,Looks like it's prealpha version of what it might be.
2094,"Advanced Python! It was hard, but I enjoyed it! "
2095,Excellent to get started with data science with Python. Very good instructor and lots of hands on exercises. Kudos!
2096,"This course was great to get a start in Data Science. I thought the lectures and the course notes were very well presented and served as a good resource for the assignments. The use of Jupyter notebooks was especially helpful. I found the course forums also very helpful in debugging my code. I have some previous experience with Pythons so the level of the assignments was easy enough that I didn't feel overwhelmed, but challenging enough for me do a lot of independent study. A criticism I have is that the Jupyter notebooks kept logging me off so saving assignments regularly failed and I had to redo work often. I usually don't pay for courses on Coursera, but the quality of this was so good that I will definitely continue with the specialization. "
2097,"Com certeza o curso melhorou o meu conhecimento em python. Antes mesmo de termin??-lo j?? aplicava os conhecimentos no meu trabalho. Contudo, terminei trabalhando muito mais tempo nas provas do que o tempo estipulado pela equipe de instrutores. Cheguei a pensar que estava fazendo tudo errado, mas vi nos f??runs que outros tamb??m tiveram a mesma dificuldade. Estou muito satisfeito, n??o quero provas mais f??ceis, apenas uma no????o mais adequada do tempo que ser?? gasto (levando em conta que estrangeiros podem demorar mais para entender o enunciado)."
2098,"Last assignment was *painful*: Poorly described instructions, outcomes/outpu; the grader was opaque and largely mute."
2099,"good when it's been around for a while, else frustrated with a lot of unclear instruction and no support."
2100,It needs some previous experience with Python and if possible with Pandas
2101,Um ??timo curso para quem quer iniciar um aprendizado em Python e em Data Sciente.
2102,the homework is interesting
2103,Briskly paced course for those new to Python and/or Pandas. Good weekly exercises that ended with a real life data analysis exercise in week 4.
2104,Thanks for introducing Pandas and Anaconda!
2105,"I learned good materials for Python from this class. The assignments are good. Only one comment: the writing of the assignments can be very vague and at times it is hard to understand. Overall, I like the class. "
2106,"Hard course, but good ROI."
2107,"While this was one of the better courses I've done on Coursera, the start date of the course was changed without any indication of when it would begin. We've also been waiting months for the next course in the specialisation to begin, again without any communication. This was a good course, but I would recommend people wait until all the rest of the courses are available before starting this course and beginning the specialisation."
2108,"This is a very well organized course with a great introduction to data science. In a short time of 4 weeks, it covers Python basics, Padans library, and some very basic introduction to statistics in data science. The assignments are well desgined, and the mentors are very helpful in the forums. I highly recommend this course. "
2109,"It was challenging yet fun to learn this course. Last but not least, the http://stackoverflow.com is really helpful. I highly recommend it to anyone who want to learn Python."
2110,This course has helped me equip basics knowledge of Python Pandas.
2111,Good at setting up the framework for the assignments. Google/stackoverflow is your friend. The course materials presents the information but you will have to go and actively learn a good amount of material. I enjoyed this approach but some may be looking for a more contained course. 
2112,"a little more help from the video lectures is expected. The assignments required a lot of self study which is great but at the beginning, every assignment looks daunting and discourages a little. Although the forums helped a lot in getting through this course, but the majority of the roadmap to take, and all other lessons should be included in the videos."
2113,very practical and efficient - high useful skills gained per time spent ratio!
2114,"Useful and concise lectures, interesting exercises!"
2115,"Although I learned a lot in this course, I found the lectures and assignments to be much too different from each other. I would like to see assignments where you must practice what is learned in the lecture. For myself, I feel I learned 1 set of concepts from the lectures and another set from the assignments by spending time on stack overflow and the pandas documentation. Both are good but the lectures and assignments did not flow together as I would have liked."
2116,The instructor was great . The assignments were good and helped me learn a lot.
2117,"It is a great, brief introduction to Pandas. I think it is ideal for someone who already knows Python but doesn't have much experience with Pandas. Lectures are well structured with quizzes interspersed. Homework assignments are also well structured and use real data."
2118,Very good course with lots of hands on experience. Jupyter Notebooks are very good learning tool. 
2119,"This was overall an excellent course, I very much appreciate everyone who has made this happen. However, the very last question of the very last assignment I found to be substantially more difficult than everything else, by a very large degree. Because of that one question I ended up moving my session twice and nearly dropped the course. https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/discussions/weeks/4/threads/1Fkg-ryCEeaIRw7T1E5tHA/replies/vK-NSNNOEeaBeg5U4yHl7A is what finally got me over the hump. The instructions were not very clear to me but the price ratio calculation was the key to success. My guess is that missed it somewhere. Anyway, thanks! I will be moving on to the next course."
2120,"I can see a couple of problems in this course. How to access and change elements in a data frame (especially the use of loc and iloc) is not explained very well and I believe there is an error in the slides. The second thing is that I have found more powerful methods in pandas documentation, for example assign() or nlargest() and nsmallest(). This is not really a problem if one of the hidden purposes is to push students to actively search the docs for what they would like to do.Work load for the assignments is just fine in my opinion, not too little, not too much.Overall I am satisfied. "
2121,"While the material is undoubtedly useful, te structure of the assessments is not very helpful. For example, in week 3 we are asked to create data frames from input files: these are presented in descending order of complexity for cleanup. Furthermore, the points for most of the questions are 6.66, despite what are very different demands fore each part. In the final week, the dictionary of state names is counterproductive in answering part one (some state names are region names) and one can either get 100% or one fails the course (as one question is worth 50% of the grade.) Some of the autograder feedback is so terse as to be downright infuriating. Add to that frequent issues with the notebook crashing and much of this coursework was an exercise in unnecessary frustration rather than increasing enlightenment. "
2122,Great hands on course!
2123,I learned in this course that pandas is a way deeper rabbit hole than it appears on the surface. However rather than teaching me pandas this course mostly just helped me verify that I was learning pandas. The questions in this class need more scaffolding. I ended up skipping most of the in-video questions because I felt that the work I was investing in getting them correct was not teaching me much. More scaffolding could fix this. 
2124,Tough course if you are new to Python and do not like to browse stackoverflow. Otherwise a great course with challenging assignments.
2125,It is not easy for me to complete this course but I learned A LOT! It is truly beneficial if you don't give up. Yes you need to search a lot of python skills online to complete the programming assignment. 
2126,"I'm an experienced data analytics professional re-skilling after being laid off. I really enjoyed this course. Professor Brooks' lectures were engaging and clear. I found the assignments to be great practice, although they were challenging for my level of programming experience.I strongly recommend having some skill with python, particularly pandas, prior to taking this course."
2127,"Excellent class, well-designed programming exercises with autograding."
2128,Finding optimal solutions for the assignments would have helped more
2129,"Skills acquired when finishing this first course are very useful and applicable. However, lectures and assignments are almost unrelated. This course is nothing for people who are new to python. "
2130,"The content and the instruction were great: just the right level for someone like me with experience in other programming languages a decent familiarity with stats.There were a few glitches with the auto-grader for the assignments, but nothing to onerous."
2131,"I found this course useful since I had no previous experience of Pandas or the statistical features of Python. I have programming experience and feel I would have found it quite a challenge otherwise, but not prohibitively so. Chris is great at explaining things in an accessible manner, and I'm very much looking forward to going into more detail in the rest of the specialisation. I would have enjoyed a little more focus on statistics etc and a little less on the mechanics of the library, but understand why it had to be approached this way."
2132,"This is the best ever of all courses I took on MOOC. It was well prepared, Clear, fast paced, informational, challenging, and with appropriate exercises. Sometime I had to pool my hair to get things done and spent a lot of time, but it was fun and worthwhile. I thank Christopher Brooks and the team. I"
2133,Very nice introduction to pandas for those who already know how to program.
2134,"Excellent course. As someone that knows R and is trying to learn Python, I found it to be just what I was looking for."
2135,This would be the best course I have in this platform. Videos and readings are very brief but homework are fantastic!
2136,"This was a very helpful course in getting comfortable with using the pandas library and different concepts in numpy in data analysis. The fact that the instructors and course materials do not give you 100% of the tools to complete the assignments is a plus. Every data analyst and programmer inevitably will have to rely on self-guidance. This course by itself may not be immensely useful in the professional world, but lays a strong foundation for the student to focus more on plotting, analysis, and conceptual learning, rather than on code."
2137,Great course. Challenging homework.
2138,"I have learned an amazing amount about Pandas and how powerful it is for Data Science, Thanks Peter"
2139,An excellent introduction to data science using python
2140,"I liked that the course was very assignment-oriented. It had a good structure and interesting additional readings. However, for people who are not familiar with pandas library it may be very challenging to pass assignments. This minimal guidance, I believe, results not in a better understanding, but in confused students writing bad code and spending hours not understanding online documentation. Overall, I really liked the idea and content of the course, but not how instructors approached the self-learning part."
2141,Great introduction to pandas and the basics of data cleaning and preparation. The video lectures are great and the optional readings are interesting. I had a blast working on the assignments and learned quite a bit. I would recommend this as a good starting point to anyone looking to learn how to use python for data analysis purposes!
2142,"Great for someone with intermediate experience in Python. A quick way to learn the pandas package, and apply it to interesting examples. A big thank you to the instructors!"
2143,Very informative and helpful!
2144,"I felt like the test-candidate for a new course. While the course-work and the presentations itsself were excellent, the homework was a real pain as very often the Auto-grader didn't work and it took me hours to get a project which was correct, to be accepted as the right solution. Cannot recommend it to be honest unless they improve their systems. Also it was said that the other course specialization start soon but it seems they don't and I paid for the full package...."
2145,The instructor should lower the speed
2146,"The course is challenging, and designed to encourage learners to be independent and make full use of the discussion forum. As long as learners do not lose sight of the fact that help is available, they will enjoy this course. But if they lose faith, this would be a disaster. "
2147,"I really like Prof. Brooks's way of teaching. He developed a very good introductory level course. Apart from some talks about data science in a whole, he concentrated on the preparatory work in this field -- data cleaning. Instead of delving into theories, he paid most of his attention to how to make things work by using python. I actually have a background in C, and I was a bit reluctant to learn python at first since C is already strong enough to attack most tasks. However, I have fallen in love with python now, and I think it is a much more suitable language for daily use especially when your projects aren't very large. Among its many merits, the best thing about python is of course its numerous libraries like numpy and pandas which free us from tedious low-level programming. I am quite convinced that I will move to python from now on.In addition to lectures, I truly recommend you go over extra reading materials. Those articles are very thought provoking. For example, the first one 50 Years of Data Science totally changed my previous view towards this field. It made me realize that data science is not a simple combination of statistics and machine learning, that it is a distinct way of obtaining new knowledge, and that its advancement shall benefit the whole science society.About the assignments, those taught in the lecture are not enough and you should refer to python documents and stack overflow. I think knowing how to solve problems and where to find help is more important than solving problems itself, and that's why I consider those assignments well designed.Finally, thanks to all the efforts made by the teaching staff."
2148,"Videos are fast-paced, material is limited (no real slides or extensive doc). Exercises are sometimes not clear in their statement. Activity on the forum compensates that. Exercises are however close to challenges you face in real life. Finally, the start date was delayed and there is no clear visibility on when the other modules are started. So, the course could be better given, provide more material and be better coordinated. I followed one Python course at Rice University which was by far better given. "
2149,Very nice course with good demonstration and practical assignments.
2150,Better course for Beginners. 
2151,"In general, this course is able to introduce the basics of data manipulation in pandas. Exercises are designed in a way that key python functions can be applied. The downside is, I feel like the grading some what less intuitive. For example, in may assignments, student has to import pandas or numpy in each and every function in order to get the score. Another problem when submitting your assignment is that students have to SAVE changes in order for the new code to take effect. Last but not least, the reading of the grading report is unclear. Students may not get the full reason for certain errors, thus creating challenges to improve their homework. "
2152,Requires most projects to be completed without the videos help. Need to research and find answers elsewhere. Also need to have good sense of python. 
2153,Great basic introduction to the pandas library and data science concepts
2154,It is a very good course for learning pandas.
2155,"Very helpful introduction to pandas. I can already think of several applications. The Jupyter notebooks accompanying the lectures were very helpful. The assignments were well thought out, and the TA posted some helpful commentary to resolve some ambiguity in the instructions."
2156,"The assignments were tough and they really tested your knowledge of python. That being said, the lectures were absolutely useless. I spent 90% of my time trying to figure out python through stack overflow. The jupyter platform is also very frustrating. For whatever reason, error messages kept coming up as I was trying to complete the assignments. At one point, I lost all my work because of this error. "
2157,It was a good course where i learned about new and great tools and techniques. I learned how to approach the data science problems using Pandas and Numpy. This would not serve as a great course for into to data science. Background with Database Management and Python really helps. Overall i learn about new and great tools and would definitely require Documentation while using the skills i learnt in this course. Overall Great Job by Professor Brooks. Would love to take more courses by him.
2158,Really good course. Provides ample time to figure out things. Does not penalize for slightly late submissions which is good for busy people. Teaches the fundamentals and asks tougher questions in assignments. Does not spoon feed the answers.
2159,"Classes moved very fast, especially in the video materials. Functions were introduced briefly without time to digest. While I ultimately did learn the topics through my own research, I feel the class would have been much more beneficial with slower, more indepth explanations."
2160,"Content is actually very good, I can feel the content creator and staffs emphasis on real world problems. Projects and Assignments are quite useful, and I can expect to use skills I acquired in my day to day work. However, the most agonizing parts of this course is it requires tremendous of time to do self-study. I spend tons of time on google search, reading docs and go over other people's post on various forums in order to find the right way(sometimes optimal way) to finish the assignments. I understand and accept that self-study is very import to master things nowadays, but I really think gap is too big between what was taught in class and what you need to complete this course, especially for people that has zero data science programming experience like me. I'd rather spend time watching 2 more hours of teaching videos per week that can cover more aspects/topics/tips/tricks than go over lots of docs and posts. I won't deny I learned a lot through this course, but I believe my learning curve can be flatten significantly if there is more class materials available. If the majority of course is spent on googling, what's the point to take it?"
2161,very practical introduction to Python programming
2162,"The course is fantastic! By practicing with the assignments, I improved a lot in python programming. I am now confident in doing data cleaning and manipulation in python."
2163,Fantastic!
2164,A pretty challenging course! I learned a lot and would recommend to anyone interested in advanced python and data science.
2165,"Many bugs, lecture content does not cover topics required to complete the assignments, assignment instructions are not written in a clear way."
2166,Great course and material.
2167,Good hands on projects.
2168,"Great Course, excellent exercises. "
2169,"Very well prepared course, good quality video and audio too (some of the older courses have crappy audio)... this class gives you enough information to allow you to research and attack new problems on your own"
2170,"Great course for data preparation for ML which is sometimes neglected in other courses. Great instructor. Useful assignments. Assignments require research on your own which is good. I would recommend to maybe make the course longer and cover more topics (in-depth string processing etc.), because it felt a bit short. Thanks Dr. Brooks for putting this together."
2171,Excellent course. Good classes and the assignment push you to go further!
2172,good solid intro to python munging. 
2173,This course was a good introduction to using Python for data science. I found the coverage of Pandas to be especially beneficial. 
2174,"Great course, it would be nice to have more interaction and feedback from TA's."
2175,"This is a great course with excellent materials and very practical assignments. The course forum is more than supportive, I won't be able to complete this without helps from my peers and all the teaching staff."
2176,It's really nice to learn pandas in this courses. Every assignment is full of challenge for me.
2177,"The course is quite demanding from the get go. If you are trying to get by with casual interest, then this is not the course for you. Much of my December vacation (which I had earmarked for playing video games) was spent coding on this course. The biggest gripe I have about the course is the grader system. It gives a binary output indicating whether you got the question right or wrong. Unfortunately, often that is not good enough, to debug your code. I spent hours figuring out what's going on. The forums were also not helpful, since there were not many taking the course.At the end of all this, if I ask myself, did I learn a lot? The answer is probably no. However, I did get a lot of coding experience. Debugging experience. We have many databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc), which have far more powerful features than what pandas can do. Therefore, as a system designer, it is unclear to me as to why I would ever pick Pandas over the rest. It appears quite slow (compared to the likes of time tested databases). It offers very few features (when compared to a DB). Lastly, I can use it only with Python. To me, it appears to be a no-brainer to use any one of those DBs to store, modify and massage my data. Maybe there are valid applications that can make use of Pandas like features, but I did not learn that from the courseSummary:Better Motivation to use Pandas over standard DatabasesBetter grader design. "
2178,"To be an introductory course I struggled a lot, is a very practical course, and the assignements encourage you to learn more. This is the best technical course I have taken. Lo recomiendo ampliamente"
2179,"Excellent course for data analysis in python, although the assignments are quite challenging and time consuming for beginners. During the course, I wish I could access to the correct codes after passing minimum score so that I could compare what I did with what common practices would be. We all code in different ways to achieve the same outcome, but it would be nice to know the most efficient ways/styles. "
2180,Very condensed and practical. Good fit for the ones who already have some experience in DS using other tools (like R).
2181,"In my humble opinion, this course does not have a correct balance of difficulty of new concepts/tools with the exercises given by the course to practice. It is a hey, look, there is something called pandas out there that may be very useful for you but it is too introductory. And I know the course has the word Introduction in the title but that does not grant, in my opinion, to run a 4-week course such as this one with so little content "
2182,"As compared to some other machine learning/data science courses offered Introduction to Data Science in Python was very pragmatic. Starting out with simple data cleaning and data structuring may not be the most exciting thing ever, but it was extremely useful to learn the basic tools needed to be a competent data scientist. One point of warning - the homework and projects took me about twice a long as suggested by the course notes. "
2183,Very interesting and fun
2184,"Positive aspects:Readings were relevant and interesting.I learned a lot.I was challenged.Negative aspects:Programming assignments took SIGNIFICANTLY longer than suggested (I have 20+ years of programming experience and am fluent in 3 programming languages, but I'm new to Python).Course did not provide enough support to learners. You're on your own to learn the material and you won't get timely responses (if any) from the staff. I asked clarifying questions about lecture material on the Discussion Forums and got no response (twice).Several concepts were not taught with appropriate detail / explanation. For example, there was no instruction on how to read error messages in Python."
2185,Nice lecture. Needs to have more videos and more advanced tutorials
2186,"Course material is interesting and modern, but its amount might be bigger - current level is not enough to complete all the assignments."
2187,i loved the course!. This was my first experience on Data Science and I really liked the approach to the subject.
2188,course was good but teaching material was not enough to complete the assignment
2189,Awesome Course......
2190,"Quite a fast-paced course, with very quick and packed lectures. Would have preferred the course to be slightly longer e.g. 6 weeks and covering more content. I actually found the style of the coursework to be a plus - though it involved a lot of Googling, this is more reflective of real life, where answers aren't just handed to you on a plate. However, the instructions for the assignments aren't very clear in places, which can easily cause you to become stuck."
2191,To much disconnect between assignments and lectures
2192,"It is a tough class for me, I read over three times, I feel good to pass the assignment."
2193,Thank you very much for this course. I really enjoyed the level of the course. In particular the fact that a decent amount of research was needed to work on the assignment. A few issues with the programming assignment. Especially at the beginning. I am assuming this is because this is the first version that uses jupyter notebooks. 
2194,"instructor is too fast, video lectures are not enough and assignment questions are not clear which wastes much time just to understand the question"
2195,Excellent Course. It covers many useful topics and tips for Pandas.
2196,"The project that is the end assignment is a very interesting exercise with real life application of information that is readly available to the public for real-world decisions.Aside from that, it is a great course that scratchs the surface of what Pandas can do and open wide open all the possibilities it can give you :D"
2197,Challenging and well worth the effort.
2198,"Very challenging course yet very informative. I am looking forward to the rest of the courses in this series. A word of warning: if you are not familiar with statistics, parts will be very difficult. If you are not familiar with Python the whole course may be very very difficult. "
2199,Great Course!
2200,Very helpful and demanding 
2201,"This is exactly the course you need to get started and familiar with Pandas. The home work requires a lot of self-study, which i enjoyed a lot. Only thing is that you have to wait until the end of the course to see best practice code for all home works."
2202,"Great course, Gives good outline to navigate through the essential content"
2203,Great Course!!!
2204,"Course is good. I'd like to see more code assignments, because the pandas basics should be studied in more details, IMHO."
2205,Excellent Introduction !!!
2206,good course. kickstarted me with python and datascience
2207,I really enjoyed this course. I found the instructor very good and the assignments were fun. I was pleasantly surprised by the whole course.
2208,assignment is a little bit messy.
2209,It was a challenge course!!!
2210,"After having taken several Data Science-related courses, this course seems like a good introduction to Python for Data Science applications. Not much 'actual Data Science' is covered in the course, however. It's more practically-oriented in the sense that it deals with data preparation (loading, cleaning and merging data). You don't get the luxury of the common perfectly-prepared csv-files in this course, which is a good thing!"
2211,Very good course.
2212,"I think the structure of the lessons are highly relevant for data sciecne and taught well. So for Syllabus content I think you are doing veryy wellCons: Nearly all the problems I encountered were related to the autograder not being helpful! There could be better error handling/debugging i.e. instead of just saying the answer is wrong, explain why and the aswer that is expected. For example, I spent DAYS on the final question (run ttest)of the last assignment. I had the right answer all along except the autograder was expecting the type to be numpy float 64, whereas my answer was just a float! "
2213,This was a good course and quite challenging. It requires a lot of self learning if you are not familiar with pandas. I wish some of the technics that were required to solve the assignments were better explained in the course material.
2214,"Excellent course and the content is presented very efficiently. I often watch lecture for other courses at a 1.25x or 1.5x speed, but this was different. I could barely keep up at the regular speed. Highly recommended."
2215,I recomendIntroduction to Data Science in Python it is a good piece of knowledge 
2216,"This is great course! I liked balance between theory and practice. And also tasks are covering something that is out of the week material, but can be easily found in the web (with provided suggestions)"
2217,"It is an interesting course. I would say this course expects more from students than other courses. It does not take you by the hand in working with Pandas. For the assignments you will spend a lot of time in the Pandas documentation and Stack Overflow. I don't know about others, but this lead to my code being very clunky and not Pandorable code."
2218,Really nice course to get you start with the Data science in Python
2219,Perfect course
2220,It provides a very good introduction to both Data Science and Python.
2221,"Great course! Dr. Brooks provides a nice and accessible introduction to Pandas, and the assignments are helpful and problem-based. Highly recommend!"
2222,"Pretty good course. I have definitely learned a lot and would like to thank you the lecturer and all the people who were working to create this course. The only comment I have is following. Please, try to formulate the questions more clear in the homework assignments. The assignment # 4 is especially bad in this sense. You can look at the comments of people in the forum to understand that it is not just my own problem. "
2223,One of the best courses in Coursera!!
2224,Assignments needs slight polishing. Otherwise course delivers what it promises.
2225,Spent more time figuring out what was being asked in the assignment rather than solving the assignment. Typos in assignment questions led to wasted hours without understanding why the grader kept rejecting solutions. Course content was useful and I would recommend if you are willing to live through the pain of the assignment submission.
2226,"Good for Beginners. Assignments are good but question framing was poor. Of course, required doubts are clarified through Discussions. Overall Great Experience doing this course. Thank you!"
2227,Very nice course. The only problem that I found was the lack of exercises between assignments.
2228,Challenging course but worth the effort! 
2229,Very good intro into how to use Pandas for working with data sets and get insights from your data by using various aggregating functions and statistical tests.
2230,Took me ages to complete the assignments given my limited programming skills! But totally enjoyed solving the problems. 
2231,"This course systematically introduced the use of Python and Pandas library to read data, clean data, transform data, and do statistical analysis."
2232,"Superb course and the staff from University of Michigan were quite committed with the learners, they've given me very valuables tools and skills, thanks a lot."
2233,Top free course about Data Science. But I think lectures must be more detailed and related to assignments. And assignments could be less ambiguous and more clear.
2234,"This is a really great course. Christopher Brooks teaches in a very clear and objective way, in addition to the weekly assignments that are challenging and puts into practice all the content you've learned trough the videos and the material. I really recommend this course!"
2235,"Although I had some background with Python and Pandas, this course brought new insights in both. With practical examples, it reinforces the conceptual understanding about working with data. I highly recommend this course even if you are already familiar with Pandas"
2236,"This is a fantastic introductory data science course on Python! I was wondered by the course structure, in-browser code editing and submitting. The first course which granted me an understanding of data cleansing, pandas and python for data science."
2237,"This is a *very* good Python Pandas course that's part of a data science specialization that I wish existed 3-4 years ago when I first started using Pandas. As much as I like Wes McKinney's book Python for Data Analysis, having an e-learning format mixing video lectures and hands-on assignments is a definite plus. I've decided to take this class out of curiosity (and in order to get ideas about a class I'm about to teach), and even if I consider myself as an experienced pandas user (top5% on stackoverflow for [pandas]). I think it's pretty involved if you're new to pandas and covers pretty much every key concept of pandas you should (must?) be aware of. The assignments can certainly look very challenging to the newcomer, and they do a great job of looking like an actual project: messy data, multiple sources, etc.I dearly recommend - and I have already started to personally recommend it - this course for anyone who's interested in learning more about data wrangling in pandas!Thanks for putting this together! "
2238,"The lectures and explanations need more clarity and better instruction quality. The assignment questions were often nebulous. This resulted in lots of time wasted with the grader. The discussion forums were the best part of this class. I'd encourage the course instructors to take a look at the University of Washington's Machine Learning class. Stylistically, pedagogically and content-wise - that's a much, much better Data Science class. "
2239,Best Python Pandas 101 course ever. Very recommend
2240,It is a great course. especially on the excellent assignments.
2241,"This course was much harder than anticipated given it was also my first introduction to Python. Knowing Python coming into this course will make it a lot more manageable. Overall it's an excellent course which touches upon a LOT of items. Given more time on each item, this course could span 10 weeks easily. I now have an understanding of Python basics along with Pandas and a dash of numpy."
2242,This course helps me a lot! Thanks for all staffs. Hope the grader system coud give more specific feedback.
2243,"Assignments are challenging, but some questions are very vague and require lots of trial and error guesswork to get the autograder to accept them."
2244,"The course gives practice in Python, but programming assignments were loaded with busy work that added little value and often had only loose ties to the material discussed in class. While this forces more independent learning, it also makes it so that this course isn't really much better than free online tutorials. I found myself learning almost everything for the programming assignments from the pandas package documentation and from Google searches that led to stackoverflow. For an instructor from the University of Michigan whose bio says I work with colleagues to design tools to better the teaching and learning experience in higher education, I was expecting a lot more value for the time spent in this class. I suspect that this course is being used to provide data for furthering his own research. It's often more difficult to maximize value to customers when personal incentives may not be perfectly aligned with customer (student) objectives."
2245,"I was quite disappointed by the almost total inaccessibility of the staff in the discussion forums, the unconquerability of the autograder for most of the assignments (losing points for no discernible reason, with all resources exhausted), the lack of a stats module for the specialization, and the lack of education, really. There is value in asking students to learn on their own, but this course goes much too far with that, giving problem sets that are virtually unsolvable without prior experience in data wrangling in R or some other data language. This leaves serious, hardworking students with little choice but to troll the forums for solutions. Hardly the best way to learn the intricacies of this subject."
2246,"great hands on course, with challenging exercises and fast paced lectures.the homework assignments need some rephrasing, as it is not always clear whats being asked.looking forward to the second course in this specialization"
2247,Overall I thought the level of the course was good. The programming assignments were complex and long enough that you had a good opportunity to re-inforce topics covered in the course. I already had a good bit of pandas experience so the course was helpful to re-inforce things I was already familiar with but hadn't been forced to try out. I think if you don't already have pandas experience the assignments might be tough.
2248,High quality content and challenging assignments. Really good!
2249,"This course is accurately advertised as requiring intermediate programming experience. It focusses on some of the basic python tools that are used in data science like pandas, specifically dataframes. For a python newbie like me, some of the assignments were quite challenging as they required significant additional reading and search. I would have appreciated if all of the concepts required to solve the assignments were introduced in the same week, so my additional reading and search would have been more targeted. Very little stats if any is required or taught. "
2250,"I thought the videos for this course were appropriately concise and well-done. The projects were about the right difficulty and length (although the one for week three was more time consuming than expected). They were interesting enough to keep engaged. I think the span of topics was also useful and appropriate. I would have liked if the autograder gave more detailed output on what was wrong with a submission. I also think it would be extremely beneficial to see the right ways of solving this problems after a submission is completed. I'm sure I didn't use the optimal pandas approach in some instances, as it stands I seem to have no way of knowing and improving my knowledge beyond getting a passing grade."
2251,"Not so easy ,not too hard!"
2252,Good content - some prior knowledge of pandas is important.
2253,"Good course, going a bit fast on certain aspects but good use of Jupyter and interesting coursework, challenging enough."
2254,Good lectures and a good introduction to the subject matter. Definitely requires additional research and practice is weak on Python and the Pandas library. The comments in the auto grading could be more helpful.
2255,"Good introductory course, but I must admit that the assignments are not explained well enough."
2256,"Very nice introduction, I wish homework were more clear and the autograder was much more smarter. "
2257,the best ever
2258,"This is a popular course series that many have expressed interest in taking. Rigorous and challenging course that offers excellent, high quality teaching of python pandas. The University of Michigan does not disappoint and neither does the delightful instructor Christopher Brooks. I highly recommend this course to anyone serious about python and data manipulation. Time and money worth spent. Interesting assignments and datasets are found each week. You will learn a great deal. Concise videos with sharp insights from an expert on pandas are seen throughout. Once you finish the first course of the series, it leaves you excited for the second course in the series. Rock on pandorable pandistas! "
2259,Wonderful Instructor. Course assignment is strong enough to learn this things. Thanks for this great course.
2260,Excellent one
2261,"Completed the course and found it pretty good for the first run. Mostly focused on the Pandas library - you'll be ok if you know a bit of Python, or have experience in another language.Looking forward to subsequent courses."
2262,"assignment is really hard, takes me 30 hours at least"
2263,"Super challenging, but good fun!"
2264,This is a very useful course. I recommended this course at people that already know how to programming. Week's homework are more difficult than in the description and needs more time( for my personal experience )
2265,One of the best place to start in Data Science
2266,"This course is a decent introduction to using the python pandas data science package, but suffers from some problems.The lectures are very brief and do not prepare you well for the assignments. The assignments are not well described and the autograder is very finicky. As a result, every week I spent several hours on the fora and stackoverflow to figure out what the autograder wants, instead of actually learning pandas. I managed to pass this course with (what I know is) subpar code, but we never get to see proper solutions to the assignments.The course has potential, but as it is now, I will continue this specialisation."
2267,"The instructor is warm and seems pretty interested.Content is way too minimal though and it's not enough to prepare the student for the assessments.A lot of searching is required in order to arrive at the solution which more often than not is not the most optimum one. Forums are only supported by fellow students and staff's involvement is next to zero in there. Even threads that deal with clarifying questions were not answered by the staff.I understand that this way enforces community building and helping fellow students, but staff's participation would be highly appreciated."
2268,"It's a good course over all. There is only one thing that I would like to suggest, which is that the autrograder does not seem to work well. It really wasted me lots of time to get the RIGHT ANSWER understood by the autograder."
2269,great intro course
2270,Very good... but question should have been properly explained (in a detail manner).. overall it was a great learning experience
2271,great course
2272,"Lectures clear and well-organized. Homework needlessly complicated and with large gap from lecture material. Grader did not give enough info when rejecting submitted work. Weighting last problem at 50% of final week was unpleasant. Hosted platform allowed importing re and io.StringIO, but grader rejected them. Hosted platform had consistent kernel failure on my last solution, but it worked on another system and grader accepted it."
2273,"The programming assignments are challenging ( atleast for beginners),with each question taking about 3 hours to complete .Many topics in Pandas are covered , making us reading the docs and finding solutions,that further helps in learning . Excellent course , good support from other learners taking the course and very very informative . No other platform can give us a course ( and knowledge ) of this standard . Planning to take more courses from courseera . However a small feedback : The description for some questions are slightly confusing . Please make such questions more descriptive with examples . "
2274,quite interesting and challenging
2275,Good one! Enjoyed
2276,"Contents are very good and assignments are challenging. Perhaps I struggled most trying to understand what the questions actually ask, they should be rephrased or be more clear. But it was a nice course and I would to it again. I am waiting for the next courses to begin."
2277,Thanks!
2278,The course was really great. Thank you! Sometimes precisely what the questions were asking weren't clear (This may have been resolved by a notebook upgrade but I did not realise this until it was too late) and I did have some issues with the autograder. Otherwise would be five stars.
2279,"Really handy and useful materials. However, if we can share our codes online after receiving the certificate will be really helpful. Cause although I finished the course, I still find some of my code is repetitive and not pandorable, and I would like to learn from other talents. Thanks Coursera and University of Michigan. "
2280,"Autograder is hard to understand and has no feedback. Could improve the feedback mechanism, maybe with peer review. Thanks for the course!"
2281,I learned A LOT during this course. I was even able to apply some of this knowledge at work after week 2 (and I do not have a technical job - I do this on my own time).It did feel a little complicated at some times. Some more detailed explanations in the assignments could help. We don't always know what the autograder expects...
2282,"A course which has great assignments. However, the video itself is a bit boring. Most of the time, my motivation to learn this course is just doing its assignments. At the same time, the assignments are somewhat difficult for those who are not familiar with Python, but for me it's just OK. What I want to make complaints about the assignments is that sometimes the Autograder is so rigid that I have to try one question over and over again until the Autograder feels happy, and for me, sometimes the gap between correct answer and incorrect answer isn't so large...And finally, thank you, teacher Christopher Brooks! You are ateacher full of passion, and I actually learnt a lot from you and your course."
2283,"Lectures were interesting and well put together, however the assignments and the knowledge required for the assignments were not covered in the lecture material. While I can appreciate that every course will require some elements of self-learning and exploration, this felt a step too far. My sense is that if you have some experience in the actual topics covered by the course, and are looking to verify your knowledge with a certificate, you will be fine. However if you are hoping to actually learn about the topics, you are going to have to work very hard. I'm hoping that the coverage of course material to assignment requirements is a lot better in the subsequent courses in this specialization."
2284,This course covers basics of pandas dataframes. So useful for amateur/advanced programmers who want to start learning data science. The assignments are very good and help students learn how to pre-process and use data retrieved from web.
2285,"The class was a helpful intro to pandas. But it was not as much a class as it was a series of homework assignments and the student painstakingly looking things up on stackoverflow. In the end, i am positive I got the correct answers using a horrible coding method and will never see the correct solutions. There should be a little bit more handholding in order for the student to learn the concepts. Otherwise, I might just throw a class up on coursera, give the link to docs.python.org, tell the students to read it and then they will be experts at python."
2286,"A hands on course on the basic tools needed to process data from experiments, web data, etc. The final assignment demands everything learned througout the course and it's a perfect example for what one would face on a daily basis."
2287,"Very hard course comparatively speaking, especially when one needs to manage so many other things. But I think it was worth the figurative blood and tears. Thank you!"
2288,Great course
2289,"Excellent class, learned quickly and simply !"
2290,Really great course about data science in python and pandas in particular. Absolutely recommended!
2291,Learn a lot with Pandas.
2292,"I have two general comments:The first comment is . . . there was too wide a gap between the lecture content and the assignments. The second comment I have is . . . I spent too much time trying to figure out what the autograder wanted and not enough time learning Data Science with Python. I can only imagine the work that it takes to develop and launch a course like this. In all, I'm very excited to be part of this program. My comments are critical but hopefully helpful and all your work is appreciated."
2293,"This course wasn't quite the cakewalk I was expecting it to be, which is perfectly fine! I definitely would recommend this course for anyone looking to pursue data science/machine learning professionally. I learned a lot of skills that employers look for, and have applied the things I've learned here in other course work as well. 5/5 would recommend."
2294,"Great course, assignments take more time than listed, and I found the discussion forum very helpful to learn more about the assignments and interact with other classmates. Overall I learned so much of commands from this course. "
2295,The assignments do not have clear definition and guildlines. It is very hard to see what's getting wrong in the submission.
2296,"Course teaches Python Pandas in a very practical way and I'm sure now having learnt it I'll use the skill. But this course wasn't taught well. Weekly assignments asked questions about skills that had not been taught yet. The course coordinators didn't respond or help in the forums, The topic area deserves more in depth video lectures and discussion. All the above basically means that passing the weekly assignments takes longer than you may assume. Had the course been taught and tested more effectively then doing the weekly assignments would less frustrating and time consuming. Basically the course is good, but it requires much more work and research because of the poor way its caught and monitored by staff."
2297,Great course! I liked how the focus was mainly on the practical aspects of data science. No 'dry' course material. I know much more about the practical side of data analysis than before! Thank you!
2298,"The course is interesting, but the grading system needs to improve substantially. The grader bugs considerably, and the questions are often not well defined, which requires a lot of unnecessary trial and error to understand what exactly the question was about. Finally, complete the assignments took way long that what it is suggested."
2299,"This is in fact the worst course so far. Mainly because of auto grader. Here are my reasons.Actually I did not complete the course at all. But I suddenly got a message saying that I have completed the course. I was working on the first problem of the 4th assignment. I did a provisional submission to see if my answer was right. Auto grader reported the grade for the 3rd assignment and said that I have passed the course. Any submission I did after that was not graded at all.The assignments are not very clear. Looks like I had a older version of the questions while others had a different version. I was stuck in a particular problem because auto grader did not give me a clear feedback as to why I was incorrect. I wasted too much time on this already.The assignments require too much research outside what is covered in the videos. I don't feel that is right. The assignment requires that we research on Stack Overflow and Pandas documentation. I strongly feel that such activities should be performed only outside the course work when we try to solve real world problems. Course assignments should be reasonably given based only the materials covered in video. This was taking too much time.TThe discussion forums are not giving clear hints. When we are stuck in a problem, we are not able to proceed further. I still son't know the answers for certain problems because the coordinators do not explain the answers well. When we complete assignments we don't get to see the instructor's solution. The video instructions were too fast paced. The instructors do not pause and explain critical aspects of the code. Overall I am very disappointed with this course. There are much better videos on Youtube and Lynda than this . I am sorry. I never thought it would be this bad. The first course on Python from University of Michigan was really very good."
2300,The assignments were good but it was a lot of time spent with the grader. 
2301,Nice course to learn data science.
2302,it's a really good course .it's not like a traditional course in university in China.You should put all your efford to finish it.And it full of challenge
2303,"The course was great - the lectures were clear and simple; I learned a great deal! However, instructions for the assessments could have been clearer, and there were a few issues with the autograder (though I'm sure those will be weeded out)."
2304,"Even short, but give a hint and big picture how data science works"
2305,"This course was excellent...I first found the course odd since the instructor went through the material quite quickly in the lectures. It took me a while to figure out that the material was available as a course download. Once I found that it was easy to follow along with the instructor...need two monitors ideally for this to work. If you cannot step through the Jupyter notebook as the instructor goes through the material, you will be lost...and you will not get the most out of the class."
2306,"The course is good and provide great challenges to do a lot of things with Python and Pandas. However, I find that its resource material sometimes lacking complex examples. This may be intentional in order for the students to learn from external resources as well. However, this can also causes difficulties for people who are not already familiar with Pandas before they start following the course."
2307,"Great! Even for someone with some python / pandas experience, it was a nice refresher / found new tips / tricks. I actually enjoyed the fact that the assignments didn't hold your hand and forced students to solve problems with the forum and other resources. Look forward to the rest of the courses in this specialisation! Two aspects you could improve is teaching is (1) Multiindex and (2) Regex. It seemed like you purposely avoided discussing these. These should be a mandatory subjects to learn. "
2308," The theory and examples are very good and cover a lot of functionalities. I like most the questions that pop up in the middle of the videos, it is a great way to check whether you understood the concepts. Some parts require refinements, the questions in the middle of the videos must be synchronized with the content (there is a little time gap) and the questions in the weekly assignments must be reviewed in depth, I dislike wasting a lot of time trying to understanding what is required to answer in each question. "
2309,This course is a challenging (and solid) introduction to using python.
2310,"This was way above my level knowledge. One will definitely a strong level of knowledge in stats and data analysis to begin with. The Python part is but only a tool in this module / course. For that reason I found the tutorials way too fast paced. I had to go back on everything and test, so a 5 mins tutorial video would sometimes take me 30 mins or longer to complete.The 3 hour / 4 hour assessments took me days! Yet - a great way to jump into something new! The course itself is great. The presentation and content is just as great."
2311,I like the course very much. It was fun to learn and to do the exercises. There were some rough edges in the assignments but I'm sure these will be straightened out in time.
2312,"The content and assignments are certainly useful and relevant. However, the lectures are too short and do not help much with doing the assignment. As a beginner, I relied heavily on google and the discussion forum to get through the assignment. And I am not sure if i can actually tackle similar problems again without referring back to the pre-mentioned resources."
2313,Excellent! A little harder for new students in python but very interesting!
2314,More concise coding tutorials and less search on your own on the internet needed. It is great to get to know the online community and the course needs more coding example directly relat to exams.
2315,"Wow, this course was intense but worth it!"
2316,A great introductory class to data science with challenging assignments to build a solid understanding of pandas and numpy . 
2317,"It is useful, but there are some notable flaws. My biggest problems were with the clarity of the assignment questions (some were unacceptably vague) and the feedback that the autograder gives. Fortunately, fellow classmates on the forums are extremely helpful in figuring this all out."
2318,"Excellent class. Needs a little work to make sure assignments a little more clear, but with a bit of work from the student, it's a great learning experience. "
2319,"I like the content covered in the lectures. That's very useful for me to clean data parsed from webpages. There is one thing I hope the course can improved, which probably has been mentioned in the forum for many times: the auto-grader is not flexible that it doesn't grant any points to answers that is slightly different from the submitted form (e.g. upper/lower cases, white space, etc.) and we have a hard time figuring out what exactly the auto-grader is accepting. I would suggest modifying the auto-grader such that it allows flexibility in answer acceptance, or breaking down questions into smaller parts (more partial credits) and give more precise/detailed description on the format of answer expected. "
2320,"Really good course BUT be prepared for a very fast pace of the lectures. I'd placed in the advance beginner or intermediate low level, therefore, you need to have previous knowledge of Python. As in College, lectures and assignments are somewhat related, but you will spend some additional time investigating by yourself to get the appropriate responses. Again, just like College where Lectures are level 2-3 but assignments are level 7-8 (out of 10)."
2321,I thank so much professor Brooks and the team of the cours. 
2322,"Awsome course with good balance betweern Challange,Reasearch and Progression."
2323,"Although the tests can be a bit fiddly, this is a great course if you already have a bit of background with Python and/or data cleaning. Lecture and tutorial videos are lean and information-dense. "
2324,"This course was excellent. This course deviates from many garbage MOOC who only work with quiz and can not provide a real python coding challenge experience. Assignements are really tough. But my sense of progress is real.(I have struggled to identify such feel in many pytyhon MOOC). Jupyter base for everythjng is a fantatsic format(it even allows coding mobility betwwen my station at work and my home station through the coding on jupyter in the cloud) . My feedback nevertheless will point to some aspect in my experience and where I think you can improve. Succeeding the assignement does not mean that we identified the most elegant way to apply all the knowledge of the course(lambdas,list comprehension, grouping..., apply) in our coding. Breaking that barrier is not easy for me unless we are forced at it and so my looping mind is often applied in assignments. A real correction with the answer need to be provided(this is what the real classroom would do, we managed to get to the answer but we could still learn more with an assisted correction just like what the real classroom would do.I understand that you are worry that the model will end up as copy paste on a webpage and will kill your value. You could maybe consider this add_on for paid customers only and only provide it in picture way which can only be paper print and not so easily converted to webpage format.Or you need to find an alegant way to randomize the assignment coding test at each coursera session, which in that case would not bring any forgery issue and you could provide the correction at the end of the course(or after each assigment completed).Videos are a bit too fast on concepts sometimes. You could split the assigment in two formats: format where simple principle of the course are first resolved on jupyter notebook (just like the videos case but with more exercices) and complex dataframe case as second assignment .(but please reduce the amounts of case to only 1 or 2, not 3) You could reduce dataframe case.(I've spend easily 40 hours on assigment here, assigment time is too heavy from my workload as a full time scientist. This needs some carefull tuning.Overall Great Job"
2325,"Really awesome course. It is a kind of do it yourself course.The assignments are tough to crack. I think a little bit of programming experience is neccessary. The lectures themselves only give the basic knowledge. The assignments make you do research on the relevant topics. The autograder is pretty bad, it gives false negatives a lot of times, but that i believe is Coursera's drawback and they are working on it."
2326,"Very challenging course. And I thought I knew Python. I learned much, much more about Pandas, idioms, lambdas, regex, etc. I will be able to be more productive at work with all this. Thanks."
2327,"Excellent course, I learned a lot especially through the assignments. Missing a fifth star because of a lot of issues with the notebooks autograding, and sometimes imprecise instructions in the assignments. Still I look forward to working on the next pandas courses!"
2328,Contents are great and very relative. Exam is fair and reasonable. However students have to deal with an autograder for the scores and the autograder is not up to par for this course. The amount of time that you spend on learning during the course is only a fraction of time you spend to get through the autograder. 
2329,"The course was challenging, and although I would have liked a bit more information from the video lectures, and a bit more practice on using the basic functions, I learned a lot. I thought the video lectures were a little sparse. There were only 20-30 minutes worth of video lectures per week and the assignments required you to stretch the knowledge that you gained from the lecture videos quite a bit. More examples in video lectures would have helped. I would have also liked to see a few simple problems in each assignments just to get comfortable using the various functions introduced in the lecture. So overall, the course was challenging and definitely a fair amount of work coming from someone new to python (but moderately experienced in C programming), and although I would have liked a bit more guidance, I learned a lot."
2330,Pace of lectures is rather fast and doesn't fit to homework level (which is much harder). But overall course is OK
2331,"A good introduction to python and data science. The questions were just about the right level of difficulty. My main criticism is that the online videos were pretty short and not going into a lot of detail, whereas with the questions you had to do a lot of extra research to figure out how to solve them. More interaction with the enrolled students during the course and having more in-depth videos would make the course a lot better."
2332,Very nice!
2333,good intro to pandas and some numpy. students need to deep dive into each subject to become proficient
2334,"Good course materials and the assignment itself is pretty good, but the grader is buggy, not informative and wasted a lot of my time."
2335,Take this course if u can invest a lot of time in searching for stuff yourself. Content and videos are okay but the assignments are very tough
2336,Great course.
2337,"Amazing Training on Python Data Science, doing the course assignment its like read the book Python for data analysis. I believe this course is not trivial and is not intermediate level, is an advanced level, Is a real challenge. Definitively i recommend it. "
2338,"A great intro to pandas. Challenging even for those with experience using the library. There were some struggles with the autogravder, but they were being worked out, and the integration of the Jupyter notebook system directly into the class is fantastic."
2339,Great Course! 
2340,"lots of practice, enjoyable."
2341,"Very nice course format. Sometimes really challenging, and outright fun ! I wish there would have been a little more participation by staff / mentors, but this is just a minor cutback. Recommended to everyone !"
2342,Excellent material. Excellent teaching. Challenging problem sets. Autograder needs some work.
2343,"To be honest, I think the course is very good, however, it may be need to more clear on the description of the questions in assignment. "
2344,Great pace for intermediate level people.
2345,"Great course, fast and deep, I liked it very much"
2346,"Very Nice! I think it's really a good introduction to use python!Maybe one problem is that homework in lesson 2 or 3 (I forgot) contain random.seed, that is explained in lesson four's video, but one can always google it."
2347,"Simple, straight-to-the-point course."
2348,"too easy, but fit the title of this course"
2349,A great first class
2350,"The course was very well structured. When I needed support once, I got valuable feedback within a couple of hours (it was over the weekend!).The only thing I didn't like was the low image resolution of the videos. Even on a big screen, I sometimes found it hard to read the code."
2351,Clear and helpful introduction to the 'Swiss army' knife of programming.
2352,"Very nice explanations for beginners, good exercises."
2353,Bill Boyd taught the topics very well..
2354,A very good introductionary course that covers almost everything you need as a beginner.
2355,A very good introductory course !!
2356,very good
2357,"liked,it was simple to follow and with good questions."
2358,This course is very useful for beginners who don't have any knowledge on Python. Spyder tool is userfriendly as well. 
2359,Good for beginners !!!
2360,"Its project oriented course. After finishing you have still much to learn, but You can taste what and how pratical things can be done in Phyton. I think that You should some background in programming."
2361,Suitable for beginners. Real quick basic-building.
2362,"This is a great course that teaches you the basics of python. I plan on taking more python courses at a higher level, but this was a nice way to get my feet wet in a new language."
2363,A really good course for beginners.
2364,Good basic course. I may have missed it but there was no discussion of libraries or more importantly where to find them until week 3. I keep using 'import xyz' but not really knowing what it was doing. I finally found the library and documentation pages that were talked about in week 03. this seems a good place to actually LOOK at them but I think they should be mention with the first excersise in week 01... here we put in 'import xyz'. this has many many functions in it that allow us to shorten the work that we do. In week 03 we open the documentation file and a library file to see how to navigate those (especially the documentation files)
2365,Good catching up with the basics.
2366,A clean introduction to Python for beginners.
2367,Very clear! I recommend this course!
2368,Went too fast.
2369,"This course really covers all the basics in a very illustrative manner. I definitely recommend it for absolute beginners in Python, previous programming experience helps but is not necessary to cover the material in a reasonable time."
2370,Great introduction to Python
2371,It's a good introduction course. Thank you so much! 
2372,"Great course, with hands on exercise very well structured."
2373,"Great introductory course, especially for someone with prior programming experience."
2374,"Thank You Bill! Great! Once I got your way of study it was a pleasure to learn. You introduce methods slowly so that it does not intervene with grasping the whole idea of the subject. Submissions needs to be very precise but that is the joy of learning on line. Sometimes you fail as you are missing one space. In terms of certificate, I do not need one and I it is quite expensive but I would surly support your course by donating. I could not see the option to do it though.Kind regards"
2375,Very good course
2376,"A good short introduction to Python programming, which would also work well as a refreshed for someone who hasn't programmed in Python for a while and wanted to brush up on some of the basic syntax. I like the approach used, through using the Spyder integrated environment, and the exercises with extensive notes. Some of the exercises are a little painful in terms of the code we are asked to write, but it does get more 'Pythonic' towards the end of the course. I found the decision to only introduce returning values from functions in the last unit to be rather surprising, and even then it was only done in a very cursory way. On the plus side, I really liked the iterative description of the development of the phone database utility, which tied together everything introduced earlier in the course.The only big issue with this course is that it could really do with being longer, and introducing some more of the key Python modules, together with more of the language features (such as list comprehensions) which people are likely to see in Python code written by others. Overall, though, it fulfils its objective to be a concise introduction to Python, and lays the groundwork for people to go and work through more extensive material elsewhere."
2377,Nice first steps inside Python language. Teacher helps and supports you through the whole course
2378,Good for novice
2379,"Nice course, enjoyed it!"
2380,A nice concise introduction (or review)
2381,Very nice course for starters
2382,I like the content of this course. But the way of delivering is confusing and boring. Sometimes I lost the logic of video. 
2383,"This is by far not my first programming course, but I wanted to learn python. As such, I found the selection of topics very good - first language basics then some libraries. The videos were a good addition. Coming from classical Unix/NetBSD, I do not use integrated development environments a lot (nor like them, per se), but I found Spyder a positive experience. Thanks esp. for that one! The grading of exercises was sometimes a bit picky, as it was not so clear what the grader was complaining about. More detailled feedback could help there. In general the automated grader is a VERY good thing, though. Thanks a lot for this learning experience! "
2384,Concise Indeed
2385,"The teacher definitely has an ability to make you understand. Even without the videos, you clearly understand the basics of Python.i wish this would be the first course of a series in Python programming.Great course!"
2386,"I have struggled with python for along time for some reason - suddenly, this professor's method of understanding really makes you understand the mechanics of how the programming mechanics work. Recommended if you have read python and have been struggling to understand even the foundations - and also - Spyder really makes things a lot easier to learn! "
2387,"Its a very good course to get yourself started with Python, The instructor is very patient with explaining all the concepts. Plus love the auto grader and the assignments "
2388,&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=prompt(1);&gt;
2389,This course is a very good introduction. The instructor is good at making the material easy to understand without talking too much. I recommend this course to anyone who has a basic knowledge of how programming works but who has not yet learned any python.
2390,Loving It!
2391,"Nice course, Good progression,Pertinent evaluations"
2392,"Great beginner course to learn Python for someone with some programming background, but new to Python!"
2393,I took this course mainly to teach my daughter and to review what I already learned years ago. Teaching style is good and assignments are reasonable. I encourage new programmers to take this course.
2394,"great teacher, great course,THANK YOU, PROFESSOR!!!"
2395,excellent course
2396,"After submitting the assignments and getting score,it will be better if Coursera provides the solution of those assignments.By this,students will get benefit form this that what mistakes they did and how will it will be corrected in future."
2397,"Self contained, hard to find hands-on course ,that offers accessible exercises that are progressively difficult (ie: without dramatic jumps), Do not use this as a comprehensive Python training, rather a very good place to practice what you think you have learned..."
2398,For the newbies to Python coding this course is excellent. I will recommend it to my colleagues and friends. I studied Python at University so for me it was easy. As final word I would ask you to make more this courses but for upper levels of knowledge. Thanks. All best!
2399,Excellent course. 
2400,Concise but useful introduction to Python. Teaching methodology is great. 
2401,This course is very useful to know the basic python language
2402,"Great introductory course. The explanations are very straightforward, the examples introduce the important basic matter and the exercices help a lot in learning to use the learned material."
2403,Excellent Course for a beginner.Looking forward to more classes by the same instructor and support groups. Thanks! 
2404,Excellent course to get a quick grasp of how python works and start using it
2405,the code shown in the video was not clear enough in some modules. Topics were explained in easy and understandable manner
2406,Good practice. Straight forward information.
2407,"It would be better if the instructor could talk about the difference/advantages/disadvantages vs other languages, and what fields are python most useful over other languages."
2408,A great course! 
2409,Best study material and very apt from a beginner perspective of learning
2410,Easy to follow.Very good assessment questions
2411,Thank you
2412,Too easy.
2413,"Brilliant intro for coding,. I suggest everyone starts from here"
2414,"I found this course as per my expectations. For first time learners, having minimal programming language experience can also learn python. Very nice explanation and course coverage."
2415,it was short and concise python learning tutorials and i enjoyed it fully.thank you coursera
2416,"This was a good solid intro course. Got a good working understanding of the Python program basics out of this. He taught less about programming basics (ie not a completely intro computing class) than another Python course I tried, which is what I wanted. Probably wouldn't be the class to recommend if this is your first programming class. Work/time expectations were as listed. "
2417,The course is interesting and good for developer to learn python. 
2418,Great Course!!! Have help me gain more confidence. Nice Examples
2419,Nice Basic course with enough explanations. The video quality was not good and text in video was barely visible.
2420,Outstanding Course. Thank you for teaching this course. 
2421,Great course material
2422,"Pros: I liked the programming examples and problems approach. I learned a lot, and feel confident to use python in future for more complicated scientific computing.cons: The videos were too long, and I found I had all the info in the examples. I would have liked more guidance on how to build up simple structured programmes - the final assignment you have a giant programme already built, whereas you could have set some exercises for split this code into two subroutines that handle different jobs.The autograder was really frustrating (sorry, I know it must be difficult to make something fair and automatic), but the great thing about a compiler or running a program is that you get to see the errors. The autograder just says 3 errors, and the problem turns out to be nothing to do with my program, which already produces the desired output."
2423,"Very good course, lesson are clear and the teacher explain very well. I'll follow up the next course "
2424,Very well explained concepts. I would recommend this to every Python beginner.
2425,The course is is targeting total beginners in programming. The material is very basic and much topics are not even touched. 
2426,A good course with adequate practice on spyder IDE.
2427,a good start for beginners
2428,Makes a lot of sense
2429,A good introductory course to programming in python
2430,Best introductory course in python
2431,"The instructor is excellent at explaining everything step by step and takes time to answer questions in detail at the discussion forums. It has been a pleasure, thank you very much!"
2432,Good quick introduction. Very good. Easy to work through the Exercise Sets. Professor typing on he keyboard quite loud.
2433,Good course.
2434,Delivers what it promises! A concise introduction
2435,"This course has made learn the fundamental basics of programing using python language. It has given a concrete foundation to progress in my programing career to model engineering solutions to real problems using python an easy, concise and readable language. On look out for more of such an interesting course."
2436,"Great introductory course. Slightly on the light side for developers looking to learn a new language, but absolutely perfect for non developers looking to learn basic programming skills.Well done guys!"
2437,Best for a starter
2438,"Nice standard introduction to python. Courses were clean and excercises were good. On the whole, a good introduction"
2439,"too basic, wish they had more content"
2440,good introduction to python
2441,Very nice. Essentials are enough to start in Python Programming.
2442,It's awesome! 
2443,Very boring
2444,A very good introductory course to learning Python.
2445,"The course content was very genuine which helped me learn commands that I did not come across in any other Python course.Thank you, Mr. Boyd. "
2446,I'm completely new to programming. the assignments are very challenging which made me fall deep in love with programming. Thanks for everyone who participated in creating this wonderful course.
2447,"This is a very good starter course, and it covers most of the things a beginner would need. The exercise were great, and so was the assignments graded by the auto-grader. There were one or two questions that proposed outputs wasn't what the auto-grader wanted, but you will figure it out when you get there. Great course. "
2448,Good course!
2449,This is an excellent introductory course of python programming. I truly enjoyed the course. Professor Boyd interacted with students frequently in the discussion forum. The mentors were very responsive and helpful as well. I am able to move on to an advanced python course easily upon completion of this course. 
2450,Great introduction to the Python programming language. Although the assignment marking seems a little rigid and tends to mark you down despite written functions achieving the expected outcomes. 
2451,Absolute beginner's course. Quick and easy overview of the absolute basic features in Python. 4/5
2452, A very handy course to get a good start with Python programming language. It is positioned well for the beginner audience.
2453,great course
2454,Concise but very clear and rich in exercises to immediately apply and cement the material
2455,Totally worth it
2456,Good introduction on Python. 
2457,Great course. Fantasitic approach and flow to teach Python!
2458,A very good course for starting with python. If you already know something about programming this is perfect for starting knowing how wonderful is python.
2459, This is a great course to start with for all the beginners out there who want to learn python. Very beautifully explained and made easy. Also doubts are cleared on the discussion forum regulary and as quick as possible.Thank you Proff. Boyd. Thank you coursera 
2460,I found this course to be very helpful. I was very impressed by the instructor's responses to forum questions and the ease of submitting (and resubmitting) my assignments. Great experience.
2461,As per Oxford Dictionary: concise / adjective giving a lot of information clearly and in a few words; brief but comprehensiveThis course: really brief; not that clear nor well-structured; not nearly comprehensive.Is it at all possible to be both brief and comprehensive when teaching programming?
2462,"A little too concise, but good advanced topics if you already had a basic Python course."
2463,A quick way to learn the basics of Python Language.
2464,Very very good. Very well explained and the idea of using examples in Spyder is excellent. Thank you so much.
2465,A well explained course. I thank so much Mr Boyd for this wonderful course.
2466,Great course
2467,"Very nice to go through the course, nicely explained. Thank you for the basics of Python."
2468,"Nice introduction to Python, very easy for beginners. It would be nice to include more discussions on why certain data types are desirable and how they can be exploited."
2469,"Good intro, but not explaining many important principles, like variable scope, for example"
2470,Best python introduction course 
2471,These are a lot of great 
2472,Covers the basics very well. Very good introductory course.
2473,Easily comprehensible course for introduction to Python Programming 
2474,"Definitely a concise introduction. I felt like the course was a little too easy and didn't provide much meat to the material. A good start for an inexperienced programmer, but too remedial for experienced programmers."
2475,The course is really great to start coding and develop interest in it. The language used is quite simple which makes it easy to understand for almost anyone. Thanks Coursera for the course.
2476,"Great course, although week 4 seems awfully short and lacking in practice."
2477,"A great soft start into Python. Being used to other programming languages (JS, PHP, a little bit of Java) and comfortable reading online documentation and finding answers in StackOverflow, I found this course very easy to complete within just a few days. Small difficulties with the grader interface at first, solved in the forum. Suggestion: include Python List Comprehension in the course. Dear Bill, thank you very much for the course and support! Now I'm looking forward to dive into Machine Learning!"
2478,"Nice course with brief, but usefull lectures. "
2479,"Ideal to get the basic python concepts, the grade exercises are fair with a proper skill level. "
2480,The videos could have been more explanatory. 
2481,Concise but not so simple. You can learn more than basic Python. The examples are very clear.
2482,"Quite interesting introduction to Python, focusing on the most important components of the language. Looking forward to other courses using the same format. Thank you Bill and team for your hard work. "
2483,"I know it is a lot asked, but would be great if the delivery was a bit more enthusiastic. Also a couple of suggestions to make the learning easier: please do not use loud keyboard when making videos, and please be mindful that some people use single screen to view video and code on the side so if the details on video are very small it becomes quite hard to see what is being written.Thanks, Janis"
2484,"Very good instruction, easy for a complete novice to learn"
2485,A really good and informative beginner course.
2486,Awesome course!! Professor Boyd will guide you through the basics of Python programming. What I liked the most is that he managed to pinpoint all the relevant aspects of python and programming and yet the difficulty is low enough to keep you motivated until the end.
2487,"Tr??s bon cours, beaucoup appris de ce cours et je tiens ?? remercier toutes ces personnes qui ont contribu??s au d??veloppement de cette plateforme COURSERA et au Prof Bill Board et ?? l???Universit?? qui a dispens?? ce cours "
2488,excellent 
2489,Excellent course to get your feet wet with Python Progr
2490,"This course allows you to know the basiscs of Python: syntaxis, functions, scripts. That's all I wanted.For now I'll continue studiyng Python for my own.Thanks teachers!"
2491,"Is a big challenge to keep the Grader pleased, I very much like this course. It is my intent continue to develop programming skills in Python."
2492,"Excellent, especially for learners already familiar with another programming language. Professor Boyd is able to quickly give an overview with just the right amount of detail --- not too much, not too little."
2493,"Se trata de un curso de programaci??n b??sico para principiantes aunque, desde mi punto de vista, se hace un poco complicado para aquellos que no tengan unos conocimientos m??nimos en alg??n otro lenguaje de programaci??n.

2494,A good course for beginners in python
2495,Very useful introduction
2496,Simple but useful. But not suitable for those who have used python
2497,"It was amazing and a wonderful learning experience! Throughout the course Instructor was really motivating, resources was comprehensive , and Instructor has done a great job remaining active almost in real time on discussion forum . I do really appreciate the Grading system. Bill, Thanks a lot for your hard effort ! Thanks also the participants who facilitated learning through discussion. "
2498,"This course was pretty okay, I'd say. I did learn several new things and consider myself introduced to the world of python. Unfortunately, as a BRAND NEW programmer, it was, at times hard to keep up. There were a number of elements that weren't sufficiently explained during the lessons/assignments (presumably because we 'should' have a basic understanding of coding already...I guess?). If this is the case, some outside study/background research may be necessary, at times. The instructor was actually relatively helpful, though the forum format makes for lag in help time, meaning you could be stuck on a problem or with a question for a while (again...outside study/research required). Overall, as I said, I learned things- yay! This course is for the very patient, however, and may likely by too simplistic for those with programming experience, too difficult for those who have never coded or maybe just right for some lucky few."
2499,Great introduction to jump into python 3.
2500,Great course! Thank you very much! I've enjoyed it very throroughly!
2501,Fast and thorough.
2502,This was great. I had to do some more reading into the videos and spend more time trying to produce output in different formats to learn more. I liked the fact that I could read the comments before watching the video and that they were enough of a primer for the lecture. I wish there would have been a similar problem like the one for the database but one where we would need to write from scratch in order to get used to the different things introduced that week. This was great as it is one of the few that use Python 3 and as a beginner I wanted to learn the new first and then work out the differences later on. Thumbs up Prof. Boyd and crew!!
2503,Good course with basic Python concepts and exercises are details focused.
2504,"Want to say thank you, really enjoyed this course, I've done some python in the past but not in the last 8 months so this has been a great re-introduction to the language.Really enjoyed it.Craig"
2505,Clear explanations. Lots of examples. Good intro class.
2506,"A quick introduction, just what I was looking for. "
2507,GREAT !! 
2508,"For the newbies, this is an appropriate introduction in Python."
2509,Good introduction to the Python programming language which covers Python 3. The assignments could have been slightly more challenging.
2510,Very nice introductory course in Python. 
2511,An straightforward introduction to python with useful exercises and examples. 
2512,Very helpful!
2513,Grate class for any beginner with no programming background or Python knowledge. Helped me to understand key basic concepts. Will be nice if you guys provide more exercises to practice and tougher questions. 
2514,"Pretty good for a beginners course, but there were some things that could have been explained more clearly.."
2515,Astonishing lectures
2516,"Level of difficulty is well build out, instructions are very clear. This course gives you the basics to get started with Python."
2517,A good place to start.
2518,very Good
2519,"This course give me a good start for python, thanks."
2520,It was an interesting first experience with Python but it seemed a little bit to easy for me actually. I have been able to complete the hole course on one free day.
2521,Best course at the introductory level.
2522,This was a nice but easy course for one having basic knowledge of Python. Liked the way of taking assignments. Thanks to the instructor Bill Boyd sir ..
2523,Quick-moving with good working methods
2524,"For a beginners course I would expect more exercises about the different control structures and built-in mechanisms in Python. This course did not really provide a good story to follow through but jumped around between loops, inputs, number conversions, file I/O and so forth."
2525,Found it a tad too basic (I'm a professional C++/Java programmer). But an excellent introduction to python. I must particularly mention the fluidity of the course embraces the spirit of the Python language.
2526,very good
2527,Very interesting! I liked all the classes and exercises. 
2528,"I really enjoyed the course. The videos were very detailed, and if you couldn't follow the information there then his exercises showed you how it worked. Really the only complaint was that his keyboard was loud during the videos, making it hard to concentrate some times."
2529,"Very good for people who just started out programming. The class gives you a chance to practice logic flow while programming. However, if you have done a little programming before, the class is too easy. "
2530,"a good course, especially as an introduction to Python 3biggest drawback: assignment autograding - if something fails, you do not know what fails, only that it fails (no info about test cases and results; negligible feedback from TAs)"
2531,"The course is pretty good, but not mobile friendly course since the font size becomes way too small for visibility. Hence learning is not possible while travelling by train / car to utilize unproductive time.Otherwise, content-wise it is pretty good."
2532,One could learn as much from any of many texts. This course does not add value
2533,The course is amazing and is a must recommend to the one's who are just starting out learning python. This course would successfully launch your from knowledge zero to a stage from which you can understand the later complexities that are involved in developing complex applications using python.
2534,Very straight forward course with easy to follow instructions. The autograder takes some getting used to. Make sure there are no additional lines at the end of your code and make sure everything is precisely copied for your output.
2535,Enjoyed greatly. The videos are straight to the point and concepts explained well. Perfect for beginners looking to learn python.
2536,"I like the course design, it's efficient and productive. "
2537,"Very Nice! I think it's really a good introduction to use python!Maybe one problem is that homework in lesson 2 or 3 (I forgot) contain random.seed, that is explained in lesson four's video, but one can always google it."
2538,"Simple, straight-to-the-point course."
2539,"too easy, but fit the title of this course"
2540,A great first class
2541,"The course was very well structured. When I needed support once, I got valuable feedback within a couple of hours (it was over the weekend!).The only thing I didn't like was the low image resolution of the videos. Even on a big screen, I sometimes found it hard to read the code."
2542,Clear and helpful introduction to the 'Swiss army' knife of programming.
2543,"Very nice explanations for beginners, good exercises."
2544,Bill Boyd taught the topics very well..
2545,A very good introductionary course that covers almost everything you need as a beginner.
2546,A very good introductory course !!
2547,very good
2548,"liked,it was simple to follow and with good questions."
2549,Good for beginners !!!
2550,"Its project oriented course. After finishing you have still much to learn, but You can taste what and how pratical things can be done in Phyton. I think that You should some background in programming."
2551,Suitable for beginners. Real quick basic-building.
2552,"This is a great course that teaches you the basics of python. I plan on taking more python courses at a higher level, but this was a nice way to get my feet wet in a new language."
2553,A really good course for beginners.
2554,Good basic course. I may have missed it but there was no discussion of libraries or more importantly where to find them until week 3. I keep using 'import xyz' but not really knowing what it was doing. I finally found the library and documentation pages that were talked about in week 03. this seems a good place to actually LOOK at them but I think they should be mention with the first excersise in week 01... here we put in 'import xyz'. this has many many functions in it that allow us to shorten the work that we do. In week 03 we open the documentation file and a library file to see how to navigate those (especially the documentation files)
2555,Good catching up with the basics.
2556,A clean introduction to Python for beginners.
2557,Very clear! I recommend this course!
2558,Went too fast.
2559,"This course really covers all the basics in a very illustrative manner. I definitely recommend it for absolute beginners in Python, previous programming experience helps but is not necessary to cover the material in a reasonable time."
2560,Great introduction to Python
2561,It's a good introduction course. Thank you so much! 
2562,"Great introductory course, especially for someone with prior programming experience."
2563,"Thank You Bill! Great! Once I got your way of study it was a pleasure to learn. You introduce methods slowly so that it does not intervene with grasping the whole idea of the subject. Submissions needs to be very precise but that is the joy of learning on line. Sometimes you fail as you are missing one space. In terms of certificate, I do not need one and I it is quite expensive but I would surly support your course by donating. I could not see the option to do it though.Kind regards"
2564,Very good course
2565,"A good short introduction to Python programming, which would also work well as a refreshed for someone who hasn't programmed in Python for a while and wanted to brush up on some of the basic syntax. I like the approach used, through using the Spyder integrated environment, and the exercises with extensive notes. Some of the exercises are a little painful in terms of the code we are asked to write, but it does get more 'Pythonic' towards the end of the course. I found the decision to only introduce returning values from functions in the last unit to be rather surprising, and even then it was only done in a very cursory way. On the plus side, I really liked the iterative description of the development of the phone database utility, which tied together everything introduced earlier in the course.The only big issue with this course is that it could really do with being longer, and introducing some more of the key Python modules, together with more of the language features (such as list comprehensions) which people are likely to see in Python code written by others. Overall, though, it fulfils its objective to be a concise introduction to Python, and lays the groundwork for people to go and work through more extensive material elsewhere."
2566,Nice first steps inside Python language. Teacher helps and supports you through the whole course
2567,Good for novice
2568,A nice concise introduction (or review)
2569,"This is by far not my first programming course, but I wanted to learn python. As such, I found the selection of topics very good - first language basics then some libraries. The videos were a good addition. Coming from classical Unix/NetBSD, I do not use integrated development environments a lot (nor like them, per se), but I found Spyder a positive experience. Thanks esp. for that one! The grading of exercises was sometimes a bit picky, as it was not so clear what the grader was complaining about. More detailled feedback could help there. In general the automated grader is a VERY good thing, though. Thanks a lot for this learning experience! "
2570,Concise Indeed
2571,"The teacher definitely has an ability to make you understand. Even without the videos, you clearly understand the basics of Python.i wish this would be the first course of a series in Python programming.Great course!"
2572,"Its a very good course to get yourself started with Python, The instructor is very patient with explaining all the concepts. Plus love the auto grader and the assignments "
2573,This course is a very good introduction. The instructor is good at making the material easy to understand without talking too much. I recommend this course to anyone who has a basic knowledge of how programming works but who has not yet learned any python.
2574,"Nice course, Good progression,Pertinent evaluations"
2575,"Great beginner course to learn Python for someone with some programming background, but new to Python!"
2576,I took this course mainly to teach my daughter and to review what I already learned years ago. Teaching style is good and assignments are reasonable. I encourage new programmers to take this course.
2577,"great teacher, great course,THANK YOU, PROFESSOR!!!"
2578,excellent course
2579,"After submitting the assignments and getting score,it will be better if Coursera provides the solution of those assignments.By this,students will get benefit form this that what mistakes they did and how will it will be corrected in future."
2580,"Self contained, hard to find hands-on course ,that offers accessible exercises that are progressively difficult (ie: without dramatic jumps), Do not use this as a comprehensive Python training, rather a very good place to practice what you think you have learned..."
2581,For the newbies to Python coding this course is excellent. I will recommend it to my colleagues and friends. I studied Python at University so for me it was easy. As final word I would ask you to make more this courses but for upper levels of knowledge. Thanks. All best!
2582,Excellent course. 
2583,Concise but useful introduction to Python. Teaching methodology is great. 
2584,This course is very useful to know the basic python language
2585,"Great introductory course. The explanations are very straightforward, the examples introduce the important basic matter and the exercices help a lot in learning to use the learned material."
2586,Excellent Course for a beginner.Looking forward to more classes by the same instructor and support groups. Thanks! 
2587,Excellent course to get a quick grasp of how python works and start using it
2588,the code shown in the video was not clear enough in some modules. Topics were explained in easy and understandable manner
2589,Good practice. Straight forward information.
2590,A great course! 
2591,Best study material and very apt from a beginner perspective of learning
2592,Too easy.
2593,"Brilliant intro for coding,. I suggest everyone starts from here"
2594,"I found this course as per my expectations. For first time learners, having minimal programming language experience can also learn python. Very nice explanation and course coverage."
2595,"This was a good solid intro course. Got a good working understanding of the Python program basics out of this. He taught less about programming basics (ie not a completely intro computing class) than another Python course I tried, which is what I wanted. Probably wouldn't be the class to recommend if this is your first programming class. Work/time expectations were as listed. "
2596,The course is interesting and good for developer to learn python. 
2597,Great Course!!! Have help me gain more confidence. Nice Examples
2598,Nice Basic course with enough explanations. The video quality was not good and text in video was barely visible.
2599,Outstanding Course. Thank you for teaching this course. 
2600,Great course material
2601,"Pros: I liked the programming examples and problems approach. I learned a lot, and feel confident to use python in future for more complicated scientific computing.cons: The videos were too long, and I found I had all the info in the examples. I would have liked more guidance on how to build up simple structured programmes - the final assignment you have a giant programme already built, whereas you could have set some exercises for split this code into two subroutines that handle different jobs.The autograder was really frustrating (sorry, I know it must be difficult to make something fair and automatic), but the great thing about a compiler or running a program is that you get to see the errors. The autograder just says 3 errors, and the problem turns out to be nothing to do with my program, which already produces the desired output."
2602,"Very good course, lesson are clear and the teacher explain very well. I'll follow up the next course "
2603,Very well explained concepts. I would recommend this to every Python beginner.
2604,The course is is targeting total beginners in programming. The material is very basic and much topics are not even touched. 
2605,A good course with adequate practice on spyder IDE.
2606,a good start for beginners
2607,Makes a lot of sense
2608,A good introductory course to programming in python
2609,Best introductory course in python
2610,"The instructor is excellent at explaining everything step by step and takes time to answer questions in detail at the discussion forums. It has been a pleasure, thank you very much!"
2611,Good quick introduction. Very good. Easy to work through the Exercise Sets. Professor typing on he keyboard quite loud.
2612,Good course.
2613,Delivers what it promises! A concise introduction
2614,"This course has made learn the fundamental basics of programing using python language. It has given a concrete foundation to progress in my programing career to model engineering solutions to real problems using python an easy, concise and readable language. On look out for more of such an interesting course."
2615,"Great introductory course. Slightly on the light side for developers looking to learn a new language, but absolutely perfect for non developers looking to learn basic programming skills.Well done guys!"
2616,"Nice standard introduction to python. Courses were clean and excercises were good. On the whole, a good introduction"
2617,"too basic, wish they had more content"
2618,good introduction to python
2619,Very nice. Essentials are enough to start in Python Programming.
2620,A very good introductory course to learning Python.
2621,"The course content was very genuine which helped me learn commands that I did not come across in any other Python course.Thank you, Mr. Boyd. "
2622,I'm completely new to programming. the assignments are very challenging which made me fall deep in love with programming. Thanks for everyone who participated in creating this wonderful course.
2623,"This is a very good starter course, and it covers most of the things a beginner would need. The exercise were great, and so was the assignments graded by the auto-grader. There were one or two questions that proposed outputs wasn't what the auto-grader wanted, but you will figure it out when you get there. Great course. "
2624,Good course!
2625,This is an excellent introductory course of python programming. I truly enjoyed the course. Professor Boyd interacted with students frequently in the discussion forum. The mentors were very responsive and helpful as well. I am able to move on to an advanced python course easily upon completion of this course. 
2626,Great introduction to the Python programming language. Although the assignment marking seems a little rigid and tends to mark you down despite written functions achieving the expected outcomes. 
2627,Absolute beginner's course. Quick and easy overview of the absolute basic features in Python. 4/5
2628, A very handy course to get a good start with Python programming language. It is positioned well for the beginner audience.
2629,great course
2630,Concise but very clear and rich in exercises to immediately apply and cement the material
2631,Totally worth it
2632,Good introduction on Python. 
2633,Great course. Fantasitic approach and flow to teach Python!
2634,A very good course for starting with python. If you already know something about programming this is perfect for starting knowing how wonderful is python.
2635, This is a great course to start with for all the beginners out there who want to learn python. Very beautifully explained and made easy. Also doubts are cleared on the discussion forum regulary and as quick as possible.Thank you Proff. Boyd. Thank you coursera 
2636,I found this course to be very helpful. I was very impressed by the instructor's responses to forum questions and the ease of submitting (and resubmitting) my assignments. Great experience.
2637,As per Oxford Dictionary: concise / adjective giving a lot of information clearly and in a few words; brief but comprehensiveThis course: really brief; not that clear nor well-structured; not nearly comprehensive.Is it at all possible to be both brief and comprehensive when teaching programming?
2638,"A little too concise, but good advanced topics if you already had a basic Python course."
2639,A quick way to learn the basics of Python Language.
2640,A well explained course. I thank so much Mr Boyd for this wonderful course.
2641,Great course
2642,"Very nice to go through the course, nicely explained. Thank you for the basics of Python."
2643,"Nice introduction to Python, very easy for beginners. It would be nice to include more discussions on why certain data types are desirable and how they can be exploited."
2644,"Good intro, but not explaining many important principles, like variable scope, for example"
2645,Best python introduction course 
2646,These are a lot of great 
2647,Covers the basics very well. Very good introductory course.
2648,Easily comprehensible course for introduction to Python Programming 
2649,"Definitely a concise introduction. I felt like the course was a little too easy and didn't provide much meat to the material. A good start for an inexperienced programmer, but too remedial for experienced programmers."
2650,The course is really great to start coding and develop interest in it. The language used is quite simple which makes it easy to understand for almost anyone. Thanks Coursera for the course.
2651,"Great course, although week 4 seems awfully short and lacking in practice."
2652,"A great soft start into Python. Being used to other programming languages (JS, PHP, a little bit of Java) and comfortable reading online documentation and finding answers in StackOverflow, I found this course very easy to complete within just a few days. Small difficulties with the grader interface at first, solved in the forum. Suggestion: include Python List Comprehension in the course. Dear Bill, thank you very much for the course and support! Now I'm looking forward to dive into Machine Learning!"
2653,"Nice course with brief, but usefull lectures. "
2654,"Ideal to get the basic python concepts, the grade exercises are fair with a proper skill level. "
2655,The videos could have been more explanatory. 
2656,Concise but not so simple. You can learn more than basic Python. The examples are very clear.
2657,"Quite interesting introduction to Python, focusing on the most important components of the language. Looking forward to other courses using the same format. Thank you Bill and team for your hard work. "
2658,"I know it is a lot asked, but would be great if the delivery was a bit more enthusiastic. Also a couple of suggestions to make the learning easier: please do not use loud keyboard when making videos, and please be mindful that some people use single screen to view video and code on the side so if the details on video are very small it becomes quite hard to see what is being written.Thanks, Janis"
2659,"Very good instruction, easy for a complete novice to learn"
2660,A really good and informative beginner course.
2661,Awesome course!! Professor Boyd will guide you through the basics of Python programming. What I liked the most is that he managed to pinpoint all the relevant aspects of python and programming and yet the difficulty is low enough to keep you motivated until the end.
2662,"Tr??s bon cours, beaucoup appris de ce cours et je tiens ?? remercier toutes ces personnes qui ont contribu??s au d??veloppement de cette plateforme COURSERA et au Prof Bill Board et ?? l???Universit?? qui a dispens?? ce cours "
2663,Excellent course to get your feet wet with Python Progr
2664,"This course allows you to know the basiscs of Python: syntaxis, functions, scripts. That's all I wanted.For now I'll continue studiyng Python for my own.Thanks teachers!"
2665,"Is a big challenge to keep the Grader pleased, I very much like this course. It is my intent continue to develop programming skills in Python."
2666,"Excellent, especially for learners already familiar with another programming language. Professor Boyd is able to quickly give an overview with just the right amount of detail --- not too much, not too little."
2667,"Se trata de un curso de programaci??n b??sico para principiantes aunque, desde mi punto de vista, se hace un poco complicado para aquellos que no tengan unos conocimientos m??nimos en alg??n otro lenguaje de programaci??n.

2712,Loved it
2713,great!
2714,This course is professional in many aspects. For me it was also inspiring.
2715,Great course. Very clear explanations for java data structures and interesting projects. Thanks UCSD.
2716,"Excellent course! I truly recommend this course. Christine Alvarado, Mia Minnes and Leo Porter have created a great course on performance and data structures. You get to learn about regular expressions, Big-O notation and searching data structures such as trees and tries. I especially enjoyed the programming assignments that Christine, Mia and Leo had prepared for us, fascinating real life examples."
2717,This is one of the most comprehensive and engaging computer science courses I ever took. The content is well explained and very useful. The idea of working on a real-world project and finishing it is what made this course really great. You will have more to show off than a grade after you finish this course!
2718,Well-structured course with great content. 
2719,Well organized course. I loved the content and the real world assignments in the course. Thank you to all the 3 trainers.
2720,"I love the course, good explanation of basics in Java.... NEEDED"
2721,very good course for data structure
2722,Great course!
2723,GOOD COURSE
2724,Great Course To revise your knowledge on data strutures!
2725,"The course is really good, I've learned a lot. The only thing I am not happy about, is lack of posibility to check the assignments without having bought the course."
2726,"Great Material, and great teachers!"
2727,Really loved the course and how every aspect covered was related to a real word application. It is an awesome start to learn the basics about data structures and algorithms in order to move to more advanced topics.
2728,Course is very well organized with solid projects. 
2729,"A very good course for beginners , people having prior knowledge about data structures might found it a bit easy , anyways the projects were fun and was course was worth taking"
2730,Such a wonderful course! It will help you walk through a challenging path to learn java.
2731,"The materials are interesting, but the course can become better if the instructors discuss more about stacks, queues and trees"
2732,That's greate course. Strongly recommended.
2733,Rebalance of the content could make the course even better. There were too many topics at week 4. Tries should be discussed in another week. The example code in the main at week 5 was a very good idea. Similar solution would make the understanding better during the other weeks.
2734,"I usually do not review courses, but this is far better than my expensive college java classes. I can not express enough my gratitude for the great quality putted into this program by the instructors. Thank so much for presenting the course in easy, challenge but fun way. you guys are the best :) "
2735,One of the best courses I have taken in coursera
2736,Exceptional so far
2737,This was another outstanding course. I will review what I've learned because everything was useful.
2738,"The presentation of the material, multiple paths to choose depending on your skill level and actual use / application of what was being taught make this an excellent course !"
2739,Great course!
2740,"Very solid review of data structures. In fact, I learned a lot of new things along the way like how to benchmark test Java code and how to properly use JUnit and other unit testing frameworks."
2741,Super awesome! I wish I had taken this earlier in my job search. It makes a lot of the algorithms you find in tech interviews super intuitive.
2742,Great review of data structures
2743,Again the explanation and representation was good.3.5-4 stars for some Data Structures and their performance. Few basic ideas and introduction about the gui of the project would make it 5stars. 
2744,very Good
2745,Content is well organised and explanation is really very good
2746,best than first part
2747,Nice Job!Thanks for the course!
2748,"It's really well made, everyone who took this course should be very proud of the program they made during those weeks."
2749,"Very good course, well taught by the instructors."
2750,Really good to learn and implement data structures and algorithms through project
2751,Thank you.
2752,Too much information in the StarterCode t
2753,Good one. Nicely paced. Necessary challenge included..
2754,wonderful
2755,Excellent explaination
2756,Best online course I have taken to date.
2757,Covers basics well. The video lectures are easy and simple to understand. Liked the assignments and they covered the learned content well. 
2758,Thank you!Please keep up the good work.
2759,This is awesome!
2760,"Brilliant course. Learnt a lot about Data Structures like Trees, Tries, HashMaps etc. The best part was implementing the back-end for the text-editor project. Highly recommend it."
2761,"Great course overall. Excellent, well compiled set of lectures and assignments."
2762,It was amazing
2763,"its very basic stuff , and uses not optimal solutions to coding challenges , which might be okay for basics , for example the spelling check/suggestion project algorithm is probably exponential in time complexity ."
2764,"Amazing course, I learnt so much about interesting data structures and gained a new understanding of how important it is to choose the right data structure for a specific purpose."
2765,"Grate course, really interesting and useful especially Algorithms.Assignments are organized very smart way it really motivates to go deeper.Thanks University of California San Diego for creating this course on coursera.org and make it available for online study!"
2766,Could be more challenging. But I really enjoyed the course!!! Highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn java and data structures.
2767,"Very good course, I learned a lot!"
2768,Excellent Course. This includes useful Data Structures. The Programming assignments are helpful. The instructors have done well to explain the concepts clearly.
2769,"Since my majors was bioengineering, whenever my computer science friends discussed about data structures and their importance, I always wondered what data structures are and why they hold so much importance. The course and the instructors who have beautifully designed and developed it, gave me really good insights into data structures. Thank you Coursera, UCSD, Mia Minnes, Christine Alvarado, Leo Porter!"
2770,5 start course
2771,"wonderful course, most beautiful is the application"
2772,"I love this class. There are a couple of data structure classes in Coursera and i think this class fits me the most. I like that it teaches data structures and how to use them in the real world. So, you will be building actual programs with the data structures you learn . It skips alot of the math stuff and I love it because i am not trying to be a real computer scientist . I dont need to know how to write a math proof on how a algorithm works what not. Maybe in the future when i want to do research, but as of right now, I just want to build cool software and have fun."
2773, Good course! 
2774,"It was really a very good course, you can learn many data structures and its implementations along with programing assignments and quizes which are quite challenging. The idea of concept challenge was awesome. You could learn performing efficiency of the algorithms, benchmarking, linked lists trees hashmaps and other data structures. "
2775,"Fantastic, enjoying and challenging."
2776,"good course,i get much knowledges about java"
2777,Thanks
2778,Excellent course continuing the tradition set from the first in the sequence. 
2779,"The course gives you understanding of basic data structures, how they implemented and show their usage in real life. "
2780,"Wow, I learned way beyond expectations!"
2781,awesome
2782,Never know anything about Data Structure before this course and it changes everything!!! a MUST for any CS student or professional.
2783,A very good course. Sets a very strong base in data structures.
2784,Great course
2785,"Super easy and practical way of leraning the basic data structures, and some other important CS topics."
2786,One of the best courses of data structures in the world ! 
2787,"Great course to introduce intermediate level data structures to the person learning Java. I have previously used these structures in other languages, but this was a good way to knock the rust off my Java skills and update myself on Java implementations. Instructors are great!"
2788,Great course!
2789,great course and valuable material that is worth to learn .
2790,There is no one participating or collaborating here! There's no way to get help. 
2791,One of the best courses I have found!.
2792,Well Done - I enjoyed these key concepts and how they were put across. Also the testing methods are pretty good. 
2793,The concepts introduced and the application of concepts in problems is very good.
2794,Learning a lot in this class about OOP and class. 
2795,Perfect course for intro of data structure
2796,clear logic and you could get to know data structure in a fast pace
2797,"Good but it was also good to let the students do some of the codings, I found the coding part actually very simple and short"
2798,I really liked this. Learnt a lot in java. Would have been a 5 start had it included some more optional assignments that appear in competitive programming contests like ACM-ICPC.
2799,The most awesome course I have ever joined.
2800,"The course does an OK (but not great) job at teaching Data Structures. And it does an OK (but not great) job at teaching Algorithm Performance/Optimization. The lectures and starter code could use some better integration. The assignments could be improved. They give you a bunch of code and ask you to complete it. This is kinda the way things work when you inherit a bunch of code, but its not how it works if you have to write it from scratch.This course has been taught many times, and the forums contained old posts, and they didn't seem as useful as in other courses I've taken. My main objective for this course was to continue learning Java, and it helped me do that, so I gave it 3 Stars. "
2801,Really interesting projects
2802,This is a great course.
2803,Projects are a lot of fun to do! I strongly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about algoritms and data structures.
2804,Good course about algorithms.
2805,"not bad,but too simple for me"
2806,Very good course containing interesting and fun projects! Professors' explanations make the topics easy to understand.
2807,Just....Awesome 
2808,It's great that this specialization now get autoGrading for projects. It could be better if the Content Quiz is more challenging.
2809,Excellent course... This course really a great pleasure to watch and do work.
2810,This Awesome I can learn for free!
2811,Very perfect course.
2812,very good lecture format :)
2813,The overall course is good. But might touch too little on Big O? Not sure. But still good course!
2814,This specialization is really efficient. I passed first course. And I'm now on a way to complete this second course and go forward.
2815,Very good series for learning Java and OO Principles. The big application approach is very interesting as we can see the whole picture even when we know little yet. The interviews with software engineers are very enlightening.
2816, Great 
2817,Great course! Big thanks!!!!!
2818,Amazing course with amazing teachers .Worth every penny .
2819,The course is extremely good. It would be still better if there is inclusion of basics to create a UI.
2820,Great course! I learned a lot in very little time.
2821,Loved it . Best MOOC specialization i have attended. Thanks a lot!!!
2822,"Well structured and explained, and, as always, provides very good programming assignments. Love this specialization!"
2823,"The lectures, assignments, and projects all encourage you to learn about how to design and use optimal search algorithms for text-based applications. I especially value how the discussions present the material in way that is relatively easy to see how it relates to search routines in general. My only complaint is that the instructions do not inform you about the constraints that the online grader implicitly imposes on you. This unfortunately meant that I was not able to submit code with further optimizations that I came up with."
2824,"The content includes interesting and useful Java programming examples. The lecturers are generally on top of their subject matter and can speak confidently without visible notes. The tests are thorough and you won't get away with only half-knowledge. If you take all the lectures and study the slides, you will generally get to the necessary level of understanding. "
2825,I recommend this course to all beginners programmers
2826," A very useful and instructive course. The difficult abstract ideas are explained very clear way. You learn the basic theory, learn to develop understading why and where use a specific Data Structure and the porjects and examples are real world problem.I am very happy that i had found this course and finished it. Thanks a lot"
2827,"Introductory course to data structures. The lectures are good, however the assignments are too much guided. Sometimes you can get it done without actually understanding what is going on."
2828,A very good course. The concepts are common and basic but the projects are fun and useful.
2829,What i really enjoyed in this courser is that I learned how to measure and discuss the performance of a software.
2830,Here I had a good introduction to regular expressions also I like the design of the project.
2831,Excellent specialization
2832,very good
2833,Great course. I learnt a lot about data structures and Java in general. 
2834,"Presented in an easy to understand format, videos are short which helps keep focus, assignments are well prepared which keeps student on the learning material. This course really helped me understand things more clearly.disclaimer: I have previously enrolled in Algorithms Part I (from Princeton)."
2835,Really liked this course! It tested my patience and logic....I am glad that I am finally been able to complete this with flying colors :)....Will take some break before the advanced data structure though! until then ...
2836, An exceptional course in intermediary programming! 
2837,Very interesting and really well taught!
2838,The course is fantastic! The professors are very enthusiastic and creative: they explain difficult subjects very clearly and provide visual aids and in-video quizes to enhance more deep understanding of material.Special thanks for the project assignments! They are very interesting and well-laid. I would recommend this course to programmers who want to deepen and practice their data-structures skills. For the novices this course should be taken after the first course of the specialization.
2839,"good course, but... paid, I can't submit the task"
2840,"Very nice intermediate course in Java and Data Structures, highly recommended."
2841,"Great class. I hope to take more advanced classes with you guys, if possible. Will you a series on complexity theory, dynamic programming etc?"
2842,"Awesome! Excellent methodology and contents! It goes to the point. Assignments are cool and help to understand the concepts. Perhaps, I found it a little bit easy, but this is also good because I can adapt my tight schedule to follow the deadlines while also remain motivated. ;-)"
2843,Was a good course for data structures and a good overview of Big O notation
2844,Nice . But It could have been better if we ourselves were supposed to make the Trees and Tries instead of relying on the java's built in classes. I learned a lot!
2845,"This course is a excellent introduction to data structures and algorithms for beginners. The lectures are extensive, complete and very helpful. The assignments are challenging and stimulating. The project is the construction of a text editor with check spelling, auto-correction, suggestion and more. It was the first time I felt involve in a large project, and you learn a little bit of software engineering too. This is the second course in the specialization and it overcomes the previous course in every aspect. I'll give five stars. The only thing I didn't like was the concept challenges, and not because of the challenges but because of the discussion with the UC San Diego learners. They are not beginners, they are actor pretending they don't know how to solve the problems when it is evident -at least it was my impression- that they are advanced students. I found them annoying and not helpful at all."
2846,"I learned useful thinks about the Data structures like lists, and trees."
2847,"This course by Alvarado, Minnes and Porter was clear, interesting and well presented. In fact, it's one of the better MOOC courses that I've taken. The assignments were of medium difficulty: not too easy but certainly not so difficult that you will get frustrated and give up. In addition, they are interesting assignments. As mentioned, the lectures are concise, clear and interesting. In fact, I recently signed up for another course on algorithms and dropped it because it was SO BORING. Also, I am taking a course on machine learning that presents algorithms. In contrast, that course is not clear whatsoever; if I hadn't taken this one then I would be very confused. Finally, I like how they have the Concept Challenges where students discuss a problem. The thought processes of multiple people talking through the problem was helpful for me. As a result, I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to brush up on performance calculations (i.e., Big O), basic data structures, and a few basic algorithms. "
2848,"Excellent engaging course, top lecturers and suitably challenging assignments."
2849,Perfectly designed..
2850,Loved it
2851,It is raising the standard.
2852,Such a nice course on Data Structures. Whats stands out is the simple explanation and assignments thats solves real world problem.
2853,Clear &amp; Explicit!
2854,"I knew most of the concepts before I get enrolled into this course, but I find the project assignments really interesting."
2855,"The work load in this course is more intense than the preceding course in the specialization, especially on week 3. Other than that, I think this was an excellent course. I'm definitely glad I took it, it taught me a lot of the things that I was looking to learn as an intermediately experienced programmer."
2856,Great course
2857,Very good :)
2858,"Loved the assignment, challenging and fun. "
2859,very cool
2860,"I'm graduated in System Analysis, not Computer Sciences, and learned to program only by experience. After 20 years it's a good deal but still I missed the theoretical background and this always annoyed me. I knew and used to make good use of all the structures presented in this course but never could quite explain how or why, or talk in asymptotic notations. Now I can. I didn't stop here, I do take some topics to deep dive during the lectures. It's being a great experience and I only wish I could have more time to keep myself always enrolled in some course."
2861,"great course, straightforward and paced very well"
2862,"Este modulo est?? muy cargado de informaci??n, sin embargo los v??deos est??n muy bien hechos."
2863,Good course to understand the basics of data structures and performance of different data structure implementations
2864,Great course to refresh my memory on data structure that I haven't been thought about after graduating from college. 
2865,"Very challenging, but totally rewarding and worth the effot!"
2866,Very good Course. The assignments were fairly challenging and required 3-5 hours per assignment.The instructors were really good. This was the first course on Coursera which I fully completed. I liked working with a large software project as part of the assignments.
2867,it grate course for me i learn a lot from this course.
2868,"This course covers some of the industry standard applications and they can be implemented. This really challenges the programmer to sit down and work some of the very good algorithms. And it shows the real usage of the Java data structures.Professors Christine, Mia and Leo's teachings were very professional and helpful. A word about the projects. After a student finishes the projects, they can confidently say they did something good with the data structures in Java.Thank you for the course instructors and everyone who worked behind this.Highly recommended for the serious Java programmers."
2869,"After so many years, I actually understood the core concepts of data structures. Thanks all three instructors. The amount of effort they are putting to make the things easy for the students is awesome."
2870,"great course, but the assignments are somewhat easy...."
2871,"Excellent Course! The explanation is so detail with examples, even a person new to algorithms can understand the concepts."
2872,"I really liked this course and the way it was taught. Although I am a CS major, I really learnt a lot of other stuff from this course apart from learning the core content of Data Structures."
2873,"Excellent course, packed full of information - A MUST for anyone who is learning the Java programming language. Lots of effort has gone into this course and is very well structured clearly defining topics week by week."
2874,Very good teachers/instructors.
2875,Amazing video lectures that help in understanding the concepts quickly. In video quizzes help make sure your thought process is right. But The assignments are way too simple if we follow all the steps provided. Assignments have to be more challenging. Surely 5 stars if they add more challenging assignments to this course.
2876,Great course! I have learned so much from testing design using JUnit on Eclipse to Algorithm big O evaluation. This course is really a delight especially due to the very cool project we built during the course.Thank you!
2877,I like it
2878,Excellent course!
2879,Interesting and practical course.
2880,Thanks a lot for great and interesting course.
2881,The best course in JAVA programming and much much more!
2882,"Very good course. This is a very right course for Java learners, will be touched on all basic stuff that are needed in Java. I will highly recommend this course for my colleagues."
2883,Very good lectures. 
2884,Great course.
2885,This course is great and uses real world projects to teach.
2886,Very well structured. Information complete and good exercises. 
2887,Best course on Data Structures with a very cool project to apply the concepts learned in this course.
2888,One of the better programming classes. Definitely recommended. 
2889,Amazing lectures and practical assignments.
2890,I can tell the tutors spent time on preparing the course. This is the most well-organized coursera course I took. 
2891,"Truly exceptional course for any beginner who wants to learn data structures from the basics. Everything is explained in detail. Loved learning things like asymptotic notations, calculating rate of growth of an algorithm. Also I liked the way the pseudo code is presented in the class made complex algorithms too easy. "
2892,"Are you good at data structures ? If not, this will be the best course to start with. You learn the data structure and implement right away in your project assigment. Very practical."
2893,Great one
2894,"Additional Programming concepts, and solidifies programming skills in Java."
2895,What l learn is how cool is data structure and how useful in real world.
2896,"This is one of the best series of courses I came along in online MOOC platform, such a brilliant course, this whole specialization is brilliant, such a interesting projects, I'm disappointed that I live in country that isn't that much wealthy to help this Specialization and to be able to do Capstone Project , but I wish all the best hope to finish all in time, this is in my top 3 online MOOC Courses and I saw a lot of them.I wish all the best to this team and people that made this possible."
2897,Thank you
2898,Cool 
2899,"This is a great course. If you ever feared (like me) about implementations of linked-list, trees, tries, you should definitely join this! It would make these things much simpler!!!"
2900,Really good course.
2901,"Great stuff! Don't give up on the first assignment, the rest are more easier..."
2902,"The instructors were engaging and most charming in the videos.Most suitable for programming learners taking the step from beginner to intermediate level. The material was divided into fun bite-sized videos, quizzes, and assignments; but still thorough with the details that were necessary."
2903,"The course curriculum is well designed and teaches students the basic data structures needed to be a successful software engineer. The project is good, and the weekly assignments are challenging. "
2904,but more depth is required 
2905,"I liked everything about this course: the theory, the programming assignments, the consistency and clarity in explaining complex things. The material was structured, well-organized, valuable and helpful. I really liked the lecturers. Mia Minnes, Leo Porter and Christine Alvarado are the ones of the best I've seen in my whole life! A Huge Thank You for your hard work and your strong dedication to what you do!"
2906,A great and comprehensive course. It was well organized and carefully incorporated the user.
2907,Promising one!!!
2908,worth taking
2909,Learned a lot of useful ideas specially how to implement your own data structure efficiently.
2910,"As all your coursers, great! I have learnt a lot!"
2911,Loved it. The assignments were fun to solve.
2912,Fun and very interesting
2913,Interesting assignments. Concise video lectures.
2914,Not difficult course but teaches you much about Java
2915,The data structures are basic in this course. But I loved working on the project. I had first hand experience on how to use Java to code these structures and I think this will help me a lot in the future. The course is well designed and I would recommend it to anybody who wants to learn Basic Data Structures with Java well.
2916,The content that has been showed through this course is enough balanced and sufficient to help learners around the world like me to understand clearly Data Structures with java and also for with the other programming languages.
2917,Amazing course! Very clear explanation of data structures and some basic algorithms. Very good preparation for the interviews. The only drawback is that the lecture slides are not available for downloading. 
2918,great!!!!!!
2919,"This is an excellent course with super awesome syllabus. It is taught in an engaging manner, with quizzes. It could have been more improved by adding in-video quiz."
2920,Great course! Interesting and challenging tasks - all of them very well prepared. Definitely worth recommending!
2921,Excellent course!
2922,Perfect!
2923,Interesting approach of core and support tracks! Great content.
2924,This courser deserves 10 stars and not just 5. I hoped that the team have started the series from the very beginning as to replicate the course 8A. I am perfering their style than from the very short Duke's course.Still Many topics to come from this extremely successful teamthanksAhmed 
2925,Amazing course! Amazing professors! 
2926,wonderful PA!
2927,This course is really useful for people who want to learn basic knowledge about data structure and performance.
2928,"A lot of very useful information. A perfect course for people familiar with the basics of java, and certainly a good continuation of the first course in the specialisation."
2929,"Very good, graded practical way to learn the fundamentals of data structures. Another great value course from UCSD."
2930,"Although I learned Java before, I never used it after second year of university. It has been 2 years and this series are good refreshing courses"
2931,Loved it
2932,great!
2933,Great course. Very clear explanations for java data structures and interesting projects. Thanks UCSD.
2934,"Excellent course! I truly recommend this course. Christine Alvarado, Mia Minnes and Leo Porter have created a great course on performance and data structures. You get to learn about regular expressions, Big-O notation and searching data structures such as trees and tries. I especially enjoyed the programming assignments that Christine, Mia and Leo had prepared for us, fascinating real life examples."
2935,This is one of the most comprehensive and engaging computer science courses I ever took. The content is well explained and very useful. The idea of working on a real-world project and finishing it is what made this course really great. You will have more to show off than a grade after you finish this course!
2936,Well-structured course with great content. 
2937,Well organized course. I loved the content and the real world assignments in the course. Thank you to all the 3 trainers.

2969,"Very good course, I learned a lot!"
2970,Excellent Course. This includes useful Data Structures. The Programming assignments are helpful. The instructors have done well to explain the concepts clearly.
2971,"Since my majors was bioengineering, whenever my computer science friends discussed about data structures and their importance, I always wondered what data structures are and why they hold so much importance. The course and the instructors who have beautifully designed and developed it, gave me really good insights into data structures. Thank you Coursera, UCSD, Mia Minnes, Christine Alvarado, Leo Porter!"
2972,5 start course
2973,"wonderful course, most beautiful is the application"
2974, Good course! 
2975,"It was really a very good course, you can learn many data structures and its implementations along with programing assignments and quizes which are quite challenging. The idea of concept challenge was awesome. You could learn performing efficiency of the algorithms, benchmarking, linked lists trees hashmaps and other data structures. "
2976,"Fantastic, enjoying and challenging."
2977,"good course,i get much knowledges about java"
2978,Thanks
2979,Excellent course continuing the tradition set from the first in the sequence. 
2980,"The course gives you understanding of basic data structures, how they implemented and show their usage in real life. "
2981,"Wow, I learned way beyond expectations!"
2982,Never know anything about Data Structure before this course and it changes everything!!! a MUST for any CS student or professional.
2983,A very good course. Sets a very strong base in data structures.
2984,Great course
2985,"Super easy and practical way of leraning the basic data structures, and some other important CS topics."
2986,"Great course to introduce intermediate level data structures to the person learning Java. I have previously used these structures in other languages, but this was a good way to knock the rust off my Java skills and update myself on Java implementations. Instructors are great!"
2987,Great course!
2988,Well Done - I enjoyed these key concepts and how they were put across. Also the testing methods are pretty good. 
2989,The concepts introduced and the application of concepts in problems is very good.
2990,Perfect course for intro of data structure
2991,I really liked this. Learnt a lot in java. Would have been a 5 start had it included some more optional assignments that appear in competitive programming contests like ACM-ICPC.
2992,"The course does an OK (but not great) job at teaching Data Structures. And it does an OK (but not great) job at teaching Algorithm Performance/Optimization. The lectures and starter code could use some better integration. The assignments could be improved. They give you a bunch of code and ask you to complete it. This is kinda the way things work when you inherit a bunch of code, but its not how it works if you have to write it from scratch.This course has been taught many times, and the forums contained old posts, and they didn't seem as useful as in other courses I've taken. My main objective for this course was to continue learning Java, and it helped me do that, so I gave it 3 Stars. "
2993,Really interesting projects
2994,Good course about algorithms.
2995,Very good course containing interesting and fun projects! Professors' explanations make the topics easy to understand.
2996,It's great that this specialization now get autoGrading for projects. It could be better if the Content Quiz is more challenging.
2997,Very perfect course.
2998,Very good series for learning Java and OO Principles. The big application approach is very interesting as we can see the whole picture even when we know little yet. The interviews with software engineers are very enlightening.
2999, Great 
3000,Great course! Big thanks!!!!!
3001,Great course! I learned a lot in very little time.
3002,Loved it . Best MOOC specialization i have attended. Thanks a lot!!!
3003,"The lectures, assignments, and projects all encourage you to learn about how to design and use optimal search algorithms for text-based applications. I especially value how the discussions present the material in way that is relatively easy to see how it relates to search routines in general. My only complaint is that the instructions do not inform you about the constraints that the online grader implicitly imposes on you. This unfortunately meant that I was not able to submit code with further optimizations that I came up with."
3004,I recommend this course to all beginners programmers
3005," A very useful and instructive course. The difficult abstract ideas are explained very clear way. You learn the basic theory, learn to develop understading why and where use a specific Data Structure and the porjects and examples are real world problem.I am very happy that i had found this course and finished it. Thanks a lot"
3006,"Introductory course to data structures. The lectures are good, however the assignments are too much guided. Sometimes you can get it done without actually understanding what is going on."
3007,A very good course. The concepts are common and basic but the projects are fun and useful.
3008,What i really enjoyed in this courser is that I learned how to measure and discuss the performance of a software.
3009,Here I had a good introduction to regular expressions also I like the design of the project.
3010,Excellent specialization
3011,Great course. I learnt a lot about data structures and Java in general. 
3012,"Presented in an easy to understand format, videos are short which helps keep focus, assignments are well prepared which keeps student on the learning material. This course really helped me understand things more clearly.disclaimer: I have previously enrolled in Algorithms Part I (from Princeton)."
3013,Really liked this course! It tested my patience and logic....I am glad that I am finally been able to complete this with flying colors :)....Will take some break before the advanced data structure though! until then ...
3014,"Very nice intermediate course in Java and Data Structures, highly recommended."
3015,"Great class. I hope to take more advanced classes with you guys, if possible. Will you a series on complexity theory, dynamic programming etc?"
3016,"Awesome! Excellent methodology and contents! It goes to the point. Assignments are cool and help to understand the concepts. Perhaps, I found it a little bit easy, but this is also good because I can adapt my tight schedule to follow the deadlines while also remain motivated. ;-)"
3017,Was a good course for data structures and a good overview of Big O notation
3018,"This course is a excellent introduction to data structures and algorithms for beginners. The lectures are extensive, complete and very helpful. The assignments are challenging and stimulating. The project is the construction of a text editor with check spelling, auto-correction, suggestion and more. It was the first time I felt involve in a large project, and you learn a little bit of software engineering too. This is the second course in the specialization and it overcomes the previous course in every aspect. I'll give five stars. The only thing I didn't like was the concept challenges, and not because of the challenges but because of the discussion with the UC San Diego learners. They are not beginners, they are actor pretending they don't know how to solve the problems when it is evident -at least it was my impression- that they are advanced students. I found them annoying and not helpful at all."
3019,"I learned useful thinks about the Data structures like lists, and trees."
3020,"This course by Alvarado, Minnes and Porter was clear, interesting and well presented. In fact, it's one of the better MOOC courses that I've taken. The assignments were of medium difficulty: not too easy but certainly not so difficult that you will get frustrated and give up. In addition, they are interesting assignments. As mentioned, the lectures are concise, clear and interesting. In fact, I recently signed up for another course on algorithms and dropped it because it was SO BORING. Also, I am taking a course on machine learning that presents algorithms. In contrast, that course is not clear whatsoever; if I hadn't taken this one then I would be very confused. Finally, I like how they have the Concept Challenges where students discuss a problem. The thought processes of multiple people talking through the problem was helpful for me. As a result, I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to brush up on performance calculations (i.e., Big O), basic data structures, and a few basic algorithms. "
3021,Perfectly designed..
3022,Loved it
3023,Such a nice course on Data Structures. Whats stands out is the simple explanation and assignments thats solves real world problem.
3024,Great course
3025,Very good :)
3026,very cool
3027,Good course to understand the basics of data structures and performance of different data structure implementations
3028,Great course to refresh my memory on data structure that I haven't been thought about after graduating from college. 
3029,"Very challenging, but totally rewarding and worth the effot!"
3030,Very good Course. The assignments were fairly challenging and required 3-5 hours per assignment.The instructors were really good. This was the first course on Coursera which I fully completed. I liked working with a large software project as part of the assignments.
3031,"This course covers some of the industry standard applications and they can be implemented. This really challenges the programmer to sit down and work some of the very good algorithms. And it shows the real usage of the Java data structures.Professors Christine, Mia and Leo's teachings were very professional and helpful. A word about the projects. After a student finishes the projects, they can confidently say they did something good with the data structures in Java.Thank you for the course instructors and everyone who worked behind this.Highly recommended for the serious Java programmers."
3032,"great course, but the assignments are somewhat easy...."
3033,"I really liked this course and the way it was taught. Although I am a CS major, I really learnt a lot of other stuff from this course apart from learning the core content of Data Structures."
3034,"Excellent course, packed full of information - A MUST for anyone who is learning the Java programming language. Lots of effort has gone into this course and is very well structured clearly defining topics week by week."
3035,Very good teachers/instructors.
3036,Amazing video lectures that help in understanding the concepts quickly. In video quizzes help make sure your thought process is right. But The assignments are way too simple if we follow all the steps provided. Assignments have to be more challenging. Surely 5 stars if they add more challenging assignments to this course.
3037,Great course! I have learned so much from testing design using JUnit on Eclipse to Algorithm big O evaluation. This course is really a delight especially due to the very cool project we built during the course.Thank you!
3038,Excellent course!
3039,Interesting and practical course.
3040,Thanks a lot for great and interesting course.
3041,Very good lectures. 
3042,Great course.
3043,Best course on Data Structures with a very cool project to apply the concepts learned in this course.
3044,One of the better programming classes. Definitely recommended. 
3045,"Truly exceptional course for any beginner who wants to learn data structures from the basics. Everything is explained in detail. Loved learning things like asymptotic notations, calculating rate of growth of an algorithm. Also I liked the way the pseudo code is presented in the class made complex algorithms too easy. "
3046,"Are you good at data structures ? If not, this will be the best course to start with. You learn the data structure and implement right away in your project assigment. Very practical."
3047,"Additional Programming concepts, and solidifies programming skills in Java."
3048,What l learn is how cool is data structure and how useful in real world.
3049,Thank you
3050,Cool 
3051,"This is a great course. If you ever feared (like me) about implementations of linked-list, trees, tries, you should definitely join this! It would make these things much simpler!!!"
3052,"Great stuff! Don't give up on the first assignment, the rest are more easier..."
3053,"The instructors were engaging and most charming in the videos.Most suitable for programming learners taking the step from beginner to intermediate level. The material was divided into fun bite-sized videos, quizzes, and assignments; but still thorough with the details that were necessary."
3054,"The course curriculum is well designed and teaches students the basic data structures needed to be a successful software engineer. The project is good, and the weekly assignments are challenging. "
3055,"I liked everything about this course: the theory, the programming assignments, the consistency and clarity in explaining complex things. The material was structured, well-organized, valuable and helpful. I really liked the lecturers. Mia Minnes, Leo Porter and Christine Alvarado are the ones of the best I've seen in my whole life! A Huge Thank You for your hard work and your strong dedication to what you do!"
3056,A great and comprehensive course. It was well organized and carefully incorporated the user.
3057,worth taking
3058,Learned a lot of useful ideas specially how to implement your own data structure efficiently.
3059,"As all your coursers, great! I have learnt a lot!"
3060,Loved it. The assignments were fun to solve.
3061,Fun and very interesting
3062,Interesting assignments. Concise video lectures.
3063,Not difficult course but teaches you much about Java
3064,The data structures are basic in this course. But I loved working on the project. I had first hand experience on how to use Java to code these structures and I think this will help me a lot in the future. The course is well designed and I would recommend it to anybody who wants to learn Basic Data Structures with Java well.
3065,The content that has been showed through this course is enough balanced and sufficient to help learners around the world like me to understand clearly Data Structures with java and also for with the other programming languages.
3066,Amazing course! Very clear explanation of data structures and some basic algorithms. Very good preparation for the interviews. The only drawback is that the lecture slides are not available for downloading. 
3067,Great course! Interesting and challenging tasks - all of them very well prepared. Definitely worth recommending!
3068,"Explanations are poorly thought out, jump around complex ideas without giving each enough time to be absorbed.It feels as if the course is in a very early stages and hasn't gone through a student review process."
3069,"Breadth / depth of content is great. Biggest issue is lectures &amp; slides to not always tell you everything you need to know to take the tests &amp; assignments - best to take Andrew Ng's course first and be ready to search on Google to find things you don't understand. Also check discussion forums, some of the quizzes actually have errors (!!) you cannot pass unless you know how to fix the questions. Kind of surprising :("
3070,"Amazing course, with a very interesting historic overview throughout the subjects, a focus on intuitive understandment, and advanced materials to keep everyone happy."
3071,"There was no support from admins/moderators/assistants. There was a buggy quiz which we would all have failed, if I did not find an old version of it on the web. This is unacceptable and clearly exposes the differences between real courses and MOOCs. "
3072,Amazing!! Gave me a deeper insight into Artificial Intelligence. 
3073,Good
3074,Thank you Professor Hinton for making such a comprehensive and insightful course!
3075,I would like to see more implementations of the algorithms shown.
3076,So useful to start with neural networks and get the bases
3077,"I got a lot of knowledge about deep learning from the course, thanks!"
3078,Very recommending people who want to learn more about neural networks learn this course. The course is hard for me but latter I will take a good review to this.
3079,This is the best course I've ever taken on Coursera. Extremely thorough and covers years worth of research and insights about neural networks.
3080,"The course materials are good and scientific. The lecturer is well prepared. However, the materials are a bit abstract, the words chosen are a little academic and rare, and the sentences used are bit long for me, which is braining burning. I with this contents can be delivered in a more simply and common way, especially for starters.The exercises within the lecture are perfect to illustrate and complement the knowledge. However, I highly suggest to put these exercises into the main lecture, not exercise. Because this makes me only understand the material after struggling with the exercises (and the answers), which is not so efficient for me."
3081,"Althoght math is a bit difficult, this course is a wonderful start for me to start the journey of deep learning! "
3082,"I feel overloaded with information and knowledge, but that feeling is appreciated and very welcome. I would like to thank the team behind the Coursera and Professor Hinton and his team."
3083,All you need.
3084,"Excelente curso, falta pulir un poco los materiales pero el contenido es muy bueno!!"
3085,"Tough going in places, but mind blowing. Geoffrey Hinton gives thorough explanations and really goes into detail of Neural Networks. A great follow up to Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course."
3086,"There is a lot of material to cover however, I think the professor and his crew do a good job on touching the most important points. The discussion group is also extremely helpful. I would suggest adding either more materials or recommended links for those willing to dig further into the mathematics details of some topics (RBMs for instance), as the material shown in the slides is way too sparse sometimes. The practical assignments were well planned and extremely useful and helpful to master some of the concepts, thanks for that. I am in the process of cleaning up the code in a way that I believe would be easier for students to understand them. I will contribute them back to the course in case there is any interest. Thanks!"
3087,very good
3088,"The excellent lecture on NN. It covers a wide variety of issues on NN throughout. However, it is sometimes difficult to understand. More explanation on basic concepts and the maths behind would help."
3089,"The course covers the cornerstones of neural nets architectures, learning, optimization and regularization techniques. Helps to get a grip on the terminology of the field, and to develop an intuition of how things work."
3090,"The slides are extremely annoying and lacks of examples, only have theoretical explanations. The man was basically read the text that was shown in the slide. I am a decent self-learner but for this course after 3 weeks I decided to drop this course."
3091,It's a good course to learn about the algorithms behind neural networks and how they work.
3092,"geof hinton is top in neural nets. in this course he gives great intuition without much math (wchich is at the same time good and bad,i personally was really intersted in the math so i spent much time looking it up, but not a single second is to be taken for wasted. worth it!). covers the up to date techniques on n.n.'s, in really great depth. each week i wondered where should it end. i'm glad to say each week was building on the last and in the end i can say i have an understanding of what's out there, what i need to read, who are some people i should follow, and prof hinton is one of them!"
3093,This is a tough course. The quizzes and assigments are even tougher. One needs a lot of dedication to succed in this course.
3094,The best neural networks course available!
3095,Amazing course 
3096,Great course for us to learn neural networks.
3097,You can learn a lot about the neural networks but only if you make your way through low quality video lectures and buggy quizzes/assignments. Geoffrey Hinton is a great scientist but it looks like he is not a good teacher. 
3098,"Great course about Neural Networks,a lot of theory,a lot of challenges,but helps a lot.Thanks everyone who participate in this course.Thank you!"
3099,A great course! George Hinton is one of the best teachers at Machine Learning
3100,This is one of the best courses I have ever been taught in my life. Thank you Professor Geoffrey Hinton and Coursera.
3101,Very good to get a good idea about some of the neural network techniques. The assignments are very well designed to help understand the concepts rather than making one do the entire coding.Very useful if you want to know the feel of the subject as well as get to know some concepts in not very deep level.
3102,The best course I've taken on Coursera!
3103,This course is very deep. May not be very friendly without much prior knowledge in machine learning or matlab programming.
3104,very good for the people who wants to learn neural networks
3105,"A thorough introduction to Neural Networks, really enjoyed the course!"
3106,"Great course, nice introduction to neural networks. Can make better elaboration in discussion."
3107,"Hinton's intuition about the models presented in this course is brilliant. He also does an excellent job of passing that intuition to the viewers. That is, without doubt, the #1 reason this course is great. There are many resources in the internet that provide the same information as this course, but none of them can provide that intuition. The later parts of the course is a little low on math, and perhaps those can be explored in optional videos, but they can also be found elsewhere on the internet.The pacing of the course is also great, as it always builds on top of the previously learnt material. There are a couple of mistakes in quizzes and assignments, and there is even a missing video on one of the weeks that is essential to passing one of the quizzes. These flaws, however, do not make this learning experience worse; they are but hindrances that can be solved by looking at the forums.What actually hinders the course is the subpar first three assignments. There is little direction in what you should do and how you should approach the assignment, and you spend most of your time to make sure your code works with the rest of the stuff that's already written for you, instead of coding for yourself. There is also little you can do to see if there are errors in your code. The last assignment, however, is just what I would like to see from an assignment at Coursera, with the program logic clearly separated to different files for better visibility, multiple steps to the assignment &amp; checks in between for us to make sure each step was completed successfully.Overall, I would recommend this course to all who wants to learn the basics of neural nets and why they work the way they do. Even if you have some basic knowledge on neural nets &amp; backpropogation, there will be useful information here."
3108,complete and interesting
3109,"This is a very interesting course that blends theory, intuition and practice but it is also demanding, also in time. It covers a lot of different topics, and is a fantastic overview of neural networks - perhaps with a slight bias to the work/interests of Professor Hinton, which is fully okay :) - but probably too difficult as a first course - I would recommend taking a basic neural network course prior to taking this course. "
3110,Excelent course to introduce the world of Neural Networks.
3111,"The course consists of 2 principal parts:1 - Deterministic models (feed-forward, conv, recurrent NNs)2 - Probabilistic models (Hopfield nets, Boltzmann machines, Deep Belief Nets)The first part is really well explained and brings a lot of understanding and practical knowledge. I'd recommend this course to anyone just because of this one. The second part is much more theoretical and requires much deeper knowledge in probability theory. The author tries hard to explain all the concepts without touching too much maths but it makes things only worse. It's impossible to understand this topic without going outside of the course's agenda.Also it would be nice to have more involved programming assignments. While current assignments make a point I see that there is still an enormous potential for improvement. Some topics are not covered at all in practice, e.g. convolutional and recurrent nets.Nevertheless this course absolutely fantastic. It gives you this feeling of becoming an expert in something.Also I want to thank Geoffrey Hinton for his contribution to the field of AI and this course. And I can't refrain from making a compliment about lecturer's absolutely adorable English pronunciation and a subtle sense of humor."
3112,"Deep and interesting introduction to machine learning and neural networks. Pace of this course was perfect for me, not too much work for every week, nevertheless it took considerable time to study all material and to complete all assignments in time."
3113,"Hinton was GREAT! A very insightful course on NN, with a lot of practical knowledges. Theory is a bit thin; there are also quite some flaws in course documents and videos (noticed by many viewers). But it doesn't change the usefulness of this course. Thank you Prof. Hinton and TAs."
3114,Very interesting course; not easy to consume but diverse and challenging; the whole concept of Boltzmann networks and belief nets was new to me &gt; great!
3115,Excelente !!!!
3116,"Great course, extremely informative and useful. A bit tough sometimes but totally worth it."
3117,"The course needs some updating, mostly in some quizzes with wrong data. Also, some of the programming assignments (specially programming asignment 3) need a little more theory. But this course is really awesome. You need to know this stuff if you mean to work with NN."
3118,Excellent explanation by prof. Hinton who invented tones of things in the field of artificial neural networks. Mechanics is clearly justified with intuition behind it.
3119,"For those who want more than just a hands on intro to neural networks this is the course for you. I've been through many resources that treat Neural Nets as a black box which, while being a fine intro, fails to give me the understanding required to do anything other than follow a tutorial. I feel like after this course I understand what's happening enough to start reading papers and thinking on my own."
3120,"The first 10 lectures, while quite theoretical, are very useful to most people learning Deep Learning for practical tasks. Last few lectures are heavily focused on RBMs and might not be immediately relevant, but are great for the historical perspectives and for people interested in more advanced aspects of Deep Learning."
3121,"Thanks Hinton and all other stuff for the great course. I spent less than one month in learning and passing this course. I don't know if I am the one quickest. I am sure I have not got all knowledge points and I will continue working on and will make deeper understanding in future work. But, I did pass it in such a short time. I was very challenge journey. I would like to share how I made it. 1) I did investigation on Linear algebra and Statistics for about 1 years that helps me a lot in understanding the math ???such conditional possibility, PCA etc. ??? quickly. 2) Before taking this course, I learned Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course. It helped me a lot in understanding the basic concept of learning theory.(such as overfitting etc.. ) . Without that experience, I would have not pass this course so quickly. 3) I did programming work for many year though I am a fresh hand on Octave. It makes coding work is not that much challenging. "
3122,"This course is a mess. Do not even dare to take it without first doing Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (excellent starter) and before reading Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville. The presentations are awfully boring, there is little interaction of the material (unlike Ng who is deriving the math on screen). Hinton is basically just reading off the crowded slides. Very poor didactic style. I would even go so far as to say that the approach is unscientific: no definitions, derivations, examples. Terms just pop out of the blue.If you already know the topic well, you might gain additional insight from a pundit. Quizes are nice puzzles that need some thinking and math knowledge. Programming tasks are not even in the same ballpark as Ng's. Overall very bad use of the medium available.Invest your time in reading Deep Learning, its challenging but at least its got a very logical structure and style. Also consider Hugo Larochelle's videos."
3123,"Very up to date and challenging. Only drawback, not a lot of application and octave/matlab is good for a fast mathematical implementation but not for real application with python packages for example.Thanks Prof. Hinton for taking the time to make these insights publicly available! "
3124,"This is a very thorough introductory course to the field of Machine Learning. I would have given it 5 stars, but towards the end, I felt the lessons got a bit sloppier. New concepts not thoroughly explained, sloppier slides, and even a lecture video missing at one point (had to find a link to it on youtube)! Still a very solid, instructive course, though. Recommended!"
3125,Excellent course! Hinton is a superstar in the field who has made many discoveries in neural networks. He does an excellent job of explaining a number of key techniques. One of the best features was his commentary on the intuition behind why these methods work. Since he came up with a number of these ideas himself (or was part of the team that did) he has a unique insight into how you can think about a problem to motivate a possibly fruitful approach. The other aspect of the course that I liked best was Hinton's copious use of real-world examples and feedback about which methods worked well on certain problems and why. The course is fairly challenging but well worth the effort. Thank you for sharing your insights Professor Hinton!
3126,"Nice course, though a little shallow."
3127,"Mathematically intense, would like to repeat the course to understand the material even better. It has made me worthy of reading the research papers in this area... Thanks for this great course."
3128,Excellent
3129,Best choice for learning NN! :-)
3130,Not very motivating lectures.. Too much talk but lacks the essential clarity
3131,"Prof. Hinton's course was my first Coursera experience and I liked it a lot. A lot of tasks of very different levels! And even if you are familiar with calculus/linear algebra some things will still be challenging. P.S. Couple of slides in the course were missing, but I hope this will be fixed soon."
3132,Thanks Prof. Hinton and Coursera. This is one of the best courses I've ever taken. I learned a lot about neural networks and deep learning!
3133,"An all round introduction to the field of neural networks, using a historical perspective, and looking deeply in to the theory. The lecturer is the godfather of neural networks, gives a good perspective of recent research by his group and others. The course has limited programming assignments (in matlab/octave), that don't really give you a good idea how to implement the ideas in the course. This is why 4 stars not 5.However, the phenomenal ideas presented, and the in depth theory, mean I am now bursting to teach myself how to build these systems, because they are so fascinating. "
3134,"The course is super interesting. However, the lectures could be better explained and the material better organized. I found myself constantly looking online for extra material to better understand the concepts. Also, you can tell that the course is not anymore groomed and there are some mistakes in a quiz due to lack of care. In any case, the course is very recommendable to start with neural networks"
3135,Masterful
3136,A little Difficult to understand
3137,"Awesome content, I leaned a lot"
3138,"I recommend this course for theoretical knowledge only. I was very upset with the programming assignments - they are few, they are not consistent in difficulty level and the way they being checked is not convenient. "
3139,Than you professor Hinton for a challenging course!
3140,"I would not recommend it as the first course in Machine Learning, but it is really great as a second course on the subject. Highly recommended for those who want to learn neural networks in more details than offered by typical machine learning courses."
3141,"I learned quite a lot that I can use for research, personal projects, and general understanding of neural networks, but unfortunately this course is getting quite out of date at this point. I would recommend to others looking for a first course in neural networks (for machine learning applications) look for a newer course."
3142,"Love, just love. It is a tough class, but I feel much satisfaction of finishing it. "
3143,"The content is theoretical, meanwhile, the application (code) is not enough to help understanding. The knowledge requirement actually is not to high. But the reading-presentation style make the class obscure. Now so easy to learn is you just follow the video. You may need to review previous chapters to try find the hidden details or google if you found you dont know what the professor are saying."
3144,great!
3145,"The course contains basic informations on neural networks at a quite abstract level. It is not enough to easily understand them without a prior preperation in mathematical details. The quizzes need strict computations based on a detailed knowledge, but usually the course does not prepare You for that. The lectures sometimes sound babble and cannot explain even easy things.It is usually impossible to get the minimum of 80% in a quiz. These are only those who have previous knowledge that can pass it the first time they take it. They do not need this course, though."
3146,Course presents an amazing set of topics form experience which spans over several decades. Professor is leading name in the field. I was extremely delighted with programming assignments which are very illustrative and well designed.Greatest minus to the course goes to lecturing approach which basically boils down to reading the slides. Additional literature in form of papers and publications are necessary to completely understand lectures. 
3147,"The lectures have basically no training or necessary teachings for the math needed for the quizzes. You spend way more time looking for resources about how to answer the quiz questions than the lectures will take to review. Even then you only given the necessary breakdown of the math involved after you answer the question correctly, which doesn't help in anyway when you are stuck.All this course did for me was help me find other courses which do a better job of going over the course materials. "
3148,Currently one of the best courses I have ever seen about ML (and especially about neural networks).
3149,Neural Networks for Machine Learning course is very useful for the people who would like to enter into Artificial Intelligence area. Thanks for the great content.
3150,"Some the work is quite hard, but trudging through it really helps understand the topic. I feel I can now read research papers that use neural networks."
3151,it is a good launching point towards further concepts in Neural Networks / Deep Learning algorithms. The course is at the right level of challenge and right level of introducing notions and concepts. Side reading / learning is strongly recommended for audiences from the quantitative field without exposures in Machine Learning.
3152,"Great course. I especially liked the quality of the assignments, that are challenging and force students to think over the courses. The only problem is that I would like to have 50% longer version that gives details on all the aspects."
3153,Great course! have Learned a lot!
3154,Awesome course. 
3155,This is an advanced course and there are a lot of things that Geoffrey Hinton talks about casually which one has to read more about on one's own. The knowledge and clarity of the instructor is beyond doubt top notch. This course if quiet exhaustive and perhaps the best course on neural networks.
3156,"This class was extremely disappointing. While the material is interesting and the mathematics and computer science are excellent, the format of the course makes substantive learning difficult. The crux of the course is based on lecture videos. Unfortunately, the videos amount to the professor simply reading off Powerpoint slides with occasional quizzes in the video. There are only 4 programming assignments, the first of which demanded a total of 2 new lines of code. Later assignments are more involved, but there are still only 4 of them. I for one only learn effectively when the class is engaging. That means slightly more dynamic lectures, more involved assignments. I don't learn or retain anything meaningful from powerpoints and multiple-choice quizzes, and I know that many agree. If you're the kind of person who can learn from reading a powerpoint slide, then you'll be fine. I got nothing out of this course."
3157,Very nice way of explaining important concepts. The assignments were engaging. Learnt a lot about Neural Networks which will help me in the future. 
3158,"This is a great course. Unlike Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, this course does not shy away from using real mathematics to explain the models being studied, and is all the better for it. Some of the explanations were a little mysterious to this student (e.g. how can you discuss sampling of restricted Boltzmann machines, which are essentially bipartite Ising models, without mentioning conditional probability?). However, Professor Hinton motivated everything so well that I always *wanted* to understand what was going on, and so frequently would pause the videos while I consulted other online resources to find out more about the topic at hand. The programming assignments were also well-designed, so that I found myself forced to confront various aspects of the models and algorithms that I'd thought I'd understood the first time round but in fact had not. Thank you Professor Hinton."
3159,Wonderful and awesome!
3160,Amazing course taught by the mystro himself !! 
3161,"Great course, I learned a lot about neural networks. I apprechiate there have been also difficult excercises. Also the programming skills are challenged."
3162,"A little bit hard to follow, but I endured to the end"
3163,Awesome course with lots of hidden gems of insight. Hinton's bury the lead lecturing style makes every video a treasure hunt. Students get to discover those pearls of wisdom if they listen carefully and read between the lines.
3164,Great course if you wish to learn about various neural network architectures and the tasks they perform best at
3165,"The course provides you with very valuable information. Even though it is quite hard and sometimes the information is not explained well enough for people who are just starting in the field, it is worth the effort. I took Andrew Ng's course first and this course after that. Andrew Ng's course gives good introduction into Machine Learning and this course gives you much deeper insights."
3166,Fantastic course for learning the ropes and gaining intuition.
3167,Very out of date.
3168,Great content. Teaching style could be improved for the medium. A couple of errors that should be rectified. The course seems poorly maintained. It is pity because it is content really valuable and hot.
3169,Great course: a lot of effort has gone into preparing it. It's a great way to get an overview of and insight into the field from a pre-eminent authority.
3170,Excelent.
3171,"Very good material and videos. However, quite a few mistakes in the quizzes and programming assignments (missing information, incorrect answers, etc) which requires a frustrating dig through the forums for errata mentioned by other users that was never incorporated into the actual tests."
3172,"Excellent course. Giving a broad introduction to different neural network approaches, while teaching a skill level allowing a comfortable start in using neural networks. "
3173,"Very nice course. It was a privilege to learn the subject from one of the best teams in the world. However, the course was harder than I expected, most probably because I could not spend much time on the videos and text, and expected to receive everything prepared for me beforehand. So be prepared to spend some time to grasp the ideas if you do not know much about the subject beforehand."
3174,"Covers a very broad range of topics, but each topics could be explained much more in-depth. Requires a lot of reading outside the course to complete. Could use much more than just four programming assignments."
3175,"Very helpful explanations if you already have some idea of what's going on. Can be a struggle if you come in with no context.I'd never heard of Hopfield Nets or Boltzmann Machines and I found it difficult to understand what was going on in the last few weeks. I think I was missing intuition and having many more concrete examples might have helped. On the other hand, for example, I already knew a few ideas behind convolution neural networks and the lectures cleared a lot up. The explanations are solid, though perhaps graze over some important things for newcomers. The next step for me is probably to rewatch weeks 11-14 now that I'm no longer a newcomer on that topic..."
3176,"This is a great course overall, even though it is a bit dated and a lot of more recent developments are not covered. There was also a mistake in one of the quizes, where they forget to mention that the values of the variables should be changed. Fortunately, someone realized that the new values were given in an old version of the quiz."
3177,a bit tough and abstract but it is worth the effortreally gets you up to speed with current NN methods
3178,The course is very good and covers neural networks at a detailed conceptual level. The course gave me a very good idea about the important concepts in this area through well structured chapters and programming assignments. I thank the organizers of this course (especially Prof. Hinton) heartily for conducting such an important and timely course. Thanks again ! 
3179,Great course to understand the mathematics behind neural networks and deep learning. Combined with some practical courses would provide learners much strong background and skills to enter deep learning world. Recommended.
3180,"The field has developed quickly, the course covers many classical theories in the field. I suggest those read the deep learning book www.deeplearningbook.org for reference"
3181,"The lesson is really boring , and the lecturer just reads the slides. And there is no any interaction on the slides, or explaining on the graphs and meaning of sentence. Just read it through. I am enough of this kind of lesson."
3182,"great content, probably better with more programming exercises"
3183,"Great course, looking forward to part 2.Thank you prof. Hinton!"
3184,"The course is an advanced one and not really suggested for a beginner who would want to understand basic concepts. Also during the course, the teaching was fast and there was lot of content to understand. The practice programs contained lot of code which was confusing for a learner like me. Hence, hoping that these shortcomings will be sorted out as and when the course profile is updated."
3185,"It is a great course, but requires a lot of additional readings and study. Compared to Andrew Ng's Machine learning this course should be seen as more an intermediate/advanced level. This course should be seen as a complementary to the Andrew Ng's class, as discuss in more detail neural networks. "
3186,This course is very benefial for student. 
3187,"The content presented in this course is really complete and well presented. It is definitively worth taking. Unfortunately, there were a few organization errors like missing video and quizzes errors. On a side note, it's great to be able to learn from Hinton since he has created many of the techniques presented in the course. "
3188,"Most remarkable course. Well put together and organized. Learned a great deal, the class has also stimulated my curiosity for delving deeper into the field of deep learning."
3189,this training gives decent background to explore more advanced neural networks
3190,"Wonderful course, its not easy, for sure, but what else could you expect from Geoff Hinton :)"
3191,"The prof seems knowledgable in the field, however the way the videos and slides are prepared is not my preference. I could not find much difference between the online class and the slides alone! There are also a couple of sections (e.g. Lecture 8a), for which the video is not uploaded. Overall I am very happy with this course but I think the presentation could be further improved."
3192,Teaching and lectures are complicated. would be better if more simple language and examples were used
3193,Solid
3194,"Very well done course! Absolutely brilliant lectures. Quizzes sometimes have questions that would be difficult/impossible to answer without additional resources, but on the whole, this is a course that I would certainly take again."
3195,"Outstanding instructor! Very well organized course material make understanding this deep topic easier. The instructor is a leader in the field, from a top notch school and with a top notch education. It is an incredible privilege to get instruction from him."
3196,"While I learned quite a bit from the course, I found the course to be far more difficult and frustrating than it really needed to be. Mentors were unhelpful and generally unresponsive during the course, course content was broken and/or missing, and the level of background in both calculus/probability needed to truly understand the material in this course was not obvious at all from the beginning. In general, the holistic experience of this course was disappointing and frankly, I would not recommended it unless you have a strong enough math background or are a glutton for punishment."
3197,"A hard course, but very useful. It helped me a lot"
3198,Prof Hinton is the champion on NN. Glad to spend my time on this course.
3199,"Great course! Amazing opportunity to be taught by G. Hinton, probably the world leading academic in this area. "
3200,"Excellent lectures; Hinton conveys depth and theoretical clarity along with practical, down to earth advice on how to get useful things done without wasting time. Unfortunately the staff did a rather spotty job of updatating and maintaining the problem sets and I had to repeatedly find corrections from other students on the forums since apparently no one was fixing the problem sets in response to the forum discussions. Shameful since they are taking our money; it would only take someone a couple of hours to fix it up. "
3201,Thanks every one
3202,One of best machine learning course!
3203,"Overall, a good and challenging course that covered a range of material from perceptrons to feed forward nets and Deep Belief Networks. However, I felt that some of the material is a little dated - convolutional neural networks did not get the coverage warranted by their recent successes. Some of the quiz items were off-syllabus too, although this encouraged further reading. I enjoyed the programming exercises, particularly on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and would have liked more of them. For beginners I would recommend they take Andrew Ng's course first."
3204,Thank you for the great foundation course. It would be great if the course introduces more up-to-date methods/results in NN.
3205,"very useful course, but i have understood about 80%)))"
3206,A very good introductory course in neural networks. Hats-off to Professor Hinton!
3207,Good overview of a large and evolving field from one of the founding fathers of Machine Learning. Nice complementary materials and further reading.
3208,Very helpful for understanding neural network.
3209,"Good course, and well taught. Lecture videos and slides could be improved in terms of summarizing the content. Quiz questions don't reflect the content."
3210,"The course looks like a part of something more detailed, complicated and wide. The most interesting part is dedicated to last algorithmic solutions for Restricted Boltzmann Machine and their connections to net. "
3211,"I took this course after completing the excellent Andrew Ng one on Machine Learning. That course was a good broad overview but I felt left me needing to know more about neural networks, deep learning recurrent neural networks, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief nets etc. This course was excellent in taking me to the next level. I now fee I understand many more of the papers, tools and models that I am seeing and am better equipped to both setup and use the same.The course is delivered in a very different way, much more of a high level overview with lots of very valuable insights that point the student in the right direction rather than providing all of the details. As a result you have to do quite a lot of independent thinking and research to answer the quizzes and assignments. Personally I enjoyed the challenge but it might not be to everybody's taste. One area where I think things could be improved is in that of the quiz integrity and of mentor support. There was very little evidence of mentors supporting students in the forums and several of the quiz questions were incorrectly setup with for example the wrong set of weights given so it was impossible to get the right answer until somebody found data from the internet that was from a previous version of the course.Overall despite the above issues I would very much recommend the course and am very glad I did it. Thanks to the team at Toronto that put it all together."
3212,"Good for understanding the various types of neural networks, but I had hoped to spend more time learning methods for optimizing model fitment."
3213,Good to learn from the master but not very detailed and hands on
3214,"The breadth of the content was good, but the depth, particularly with the recurrent networks from later weeks, was a bit lacking. There were a few quiz problems I spent a while on, only to check the discussion section and realize that the information/image provided was inaccurate. The coding assignments could be slightly more frequent. Overall, this was a good course. It seems like it would be difficult to give a thorough treatment of this topic by simply watching these lectures and taking the quizzes/programming assignments. I think this course is best used for introductions to various topics/authors, which can then be used as a stepping stone for more intricate, individual study on those topics."
3215,"Great course! The course provides intensive but very well-organized contents, I have learnt a lot from it. There is no time-wasting explanation in the lectures. $49 is the most worth amount of money I had spent in recent years. Wish coursera provide more high quality courses like this. "
3216,MATERIALS NOT WELL PREPARED
3217,"Difficult, awesome, brilliant and life changing course- will leave you thinking for the rest of your career. It took me two tries to even begin to grasp some of the concepts. Once you get on the track, be prepared to be amazed. It changed the way I look at a problem and changed my career goal as well. I would like see more courses from G. Hinton. You are rightfully called the Godfather of Deep Learning. Wish you all the best."
3218,"very good course, it gives us the information of the state of the art of deep learning until 2012, also how were neural networks built to being the most important tecnology nowadays.some material and assignements new to be updated, but anyway the experience was awsome, nevertheless to feel good with this course also is needed machine learning pre-concepts, and some calculus, be able to adapt to diferente terminology of kind of topics, becuase the content is very long, but fancy"
3219,Best to follow
3220,"Excellent course to learn both fundamentals and state of the art techniques in NN. Ant it's taught by Hinton, who is one of the fathers of NN/Deep Learning !"
3221,good overview but not up to date and some errors in quizes
3222,I liked the content of this course and for the most part I thought it was pretty decent. I just felt that the lectures needed a bit more structure since there didn't seem to be a very good transition between topics. The some of the quiz questions in this course were broken since they were missing details that we crucial to answering the questions (missing weights or having wrong answers since the posted values didn't align with the answer).
3223,"I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that this is a poorly made course for building a thorough understanding of how these different Neural Networks actually function, and building a lower level understanding. The lecturer often introduces concepts that are specific to these types of neural networks without explaining what they are. For example, when discussing convolutional nets, he casually starts talking about an embedding layer and a mapping layer, without really explaining what it is. I found this video on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6aEYuemt0M) and realized that this gives me a significantly more concrete understanding of how convolutional neural networks actually function, than these lectures."
3224,excellent
3225,It has a few missing conditions in some of quizs. So it spend more time to solve it. But it's still a good course to learn the basic of deep learning.
3226,"Very good course for someone who wants to feel of neural net, deep belief net and RBM. Geoffrey is awesome. You will be able learn and understand neural net intuitively. "
3227,Awsome
3228,The course material was useful however greatly disappointed with the organisation. Many quizzes had in-complete questions (no figures) and there was no corrections made. I had to resort to checking through forums for the correct questions. 
3229,"Very good and interesting introduction to neural networks. I particularly appreciated the history behind the different types of neural networks so that one understands where the basic ideas come from. I was however a bit disappointed in terms of mathematics, the course could have used a bit more mathematical formalism and some more hands on exercises. Still, I warmly recommend this course!"
3230,I learned a lot about deep learning. However the quiz contains several mistakes and I wasted many hours. I also thought explanation is unnecessarily hard to understand.
3231,"This is a great mathematical course to understand what's going on, but the assignments and quizzes are just repetitive and basically run these commands. Professor Hinton definitely knows his stuff, and just sitting through his lectures was worth the time. That being said, Week 13 is busted as of 2017-1-22, Question 6 and 7 use variables values that are never mentioned. The only way I passed it was to google an old version of the course in Chinese that had a line saying please use these other variables"
3232,"Good balance of theory, practice, historical background and humor. I finally learned how to do back-propagation on paper :)"
3233,"You can get many knowledge from this course, but you have to be prepared. Actually learning course gives me no pleasure. It is not complete, you have to guess many things and find additional materials somewhere else to pass all course quizzes and assignments. BTW some quizzes are invalid. I think there was some issues while migrating to updated coursera version, that is why some course materials lost."
3234,Very good content!
3235,"The course is very interesting and detailed but maybe too technical in some parts.Also, some (not too sporadic) errors and missing pieces of information in the questions made quizzes even harder to pass. The discussions on the forum were of great help in this sense, though."
3236,"Good teaching, good tests and exams (even to procrastinators xp , nice dynamics for programming assignments."
3237,"This course is deep. I spent hours on some of the quizzes and assignments, viewing many of the videos several times over. Ng's ML course (also excellent) is like an undergrad course. Hinton's is like a graduate level course. Lots of background reading, covering a wide range of topics. Having completed the course, I believe I've gotten a good grounding in current thinking on machine learning."
3238,Learning a lot so far
3239,Very interesting course. It gives you a quite deep understanding of Neural Networks and Deep Learning. An excellent starting point to start mastering these technique. 
3240,Not for beginners on deep learning but great for those starting to dive in the subject
3241,Very informative program and sets the beginning on neural network. I would like to see more practical examples on the application of these algorithm
3242,Prof Hinton shares all his knowledge in designing an award-winning neural network. This is less a hands-on course but is more a very profound teaching of deep learning theory. If you can understand everything that is taught in this course then you will be the next genius that comes up with the next bleeding edge neural nets. That's not for me though as I struggled from week to week till the end but I learned a lot. Many thanks to Prof Hinton for generously sharing his knowledge and insights in this topic. 
3243,"Overall I really loved this course, and taking it from such an important name in the field was cool. There were a number of technical glitches on the quizzes, unfortunately, and often the wording on quizzes was unnecessarily confusing (but still manageable) so I dock it a single star. Also the visual organization of the lecture slides is a little shoddy compared to many other versions of nearly identical slides from Hinton's courses found online elsewhere. On the mobile app, many of the quiz questions were impossible to complete because graphics could not load. Not sure if it's a problem with the course materials or with the app or with my device, so that has not affected my rating. For anyone considering this course, be advised that ability in calculus and statistics are required for mastery of this material."
3244,"Interesting course, good lecturer, but slides have too much text so it was a bit difficult to follow."
3245,"A good course that covers everything there is about Neural Networks - from history to the very latest topics in this domain. Not to mention that the instructor - Prof. Hinton, is a pioneer and leading researcher in this field. People may find Prof. Hinton's teaching style a little different/difficult to follow initially, but please do stick with him and it gets better. And the supplementary reading material contains some of the best research papers on the topics and is a must read for everyone taking this course. Overall a very good course to take if one is interested in ML and NNs."
3246,"Good course, but is not so well interpreted. In some cases, I really donot understand what does the lecturer talks about."
3247,"I have mixed feelings about this course. On one hand, scope is ambitious and getting to attend a course by G Hinton is a luxury. On the other hand, some topics are addressed confusingly (e.g. Hopfield Nets) or without going into much detail. But I think the worst of this course, and I wish Coursera would take care of that, is some quizzes being completely broken (missing or incorrect data), forcing you to go to Forums to get the correct question.There are big gaps of data and no course biography to follow or complete the missing gaps (lecture resources, when available, is just papers on the topic). Also, the course would benefit from better programming exercises... as it stands it is just download a program, complete a couple of methods, fill in the gaps on a quiz"
3248,loved the course. learnt a lot about neural networks
3249,Very good.
3250,"The videos and the papers presented gave a full overview about the last 3 decades on neuro network research. The course has very tough concepts (RBM, Sigmoid Belief Networks, LSTM), but it can be followed if you have a solid background in math or computer science. The exercises in Octave were well designed to introduce concepts and to give a hands on about how to tune neuro networks. The unique point to improve this course is that there some mistakes in quizzes from 1 or 2 weeks related with missing images (wrong weights to calculate anwsers). The forum helped a lot, but it could be fixed to avoid more complaints. Apart from this minor issue, it is an excellent course from this exciting and promising field."
3251,"Great course, highly informative. The generative models parts is especially interesting. "
3252,"Great material, it is amazing that lectures by one of the most influential people in the neural network for machine learning community are freely available for everyone. The course could benefit from additional topics that appeared over the last 1-2 years (GANs for instance). There was a number of problems with quizes like missing parts of question descriptions, missing images or broken links."
3253,"The course gives I think a good overview over the concepts of neural networks and the teaching material is good. However generally the course is more advanced than I suspected, so it took me much more time then what is given for the lectures / quizzes to complete it. If you are not already familiar with the concepts and/or have a strong mathematical background it can be sometimes frustrating :-) One thing that definitively needs improvement is that 2 times the questions of the quizzes were corrupted (parts were missing). Not sure if this was due to the material itself or a bug in the Cousera platform. So look in the discussion forum if you find something strange in the quizzes."
3254,"Brilliant course! I have reviewed this course many times, learning more each time, and I cannot thank Professor Hinton and Coursera enough for making this course available. This course was first offered 4 years ago, but the material (as of 2017) is still quite fresh and relevant, and I would say 'required' for anyone who wants to gain a solid understanding in Neural Networks, learning directly from one of the pioneers of Deep Learning. "
3255,Some mistakes in the materials and quizes make this course stronger that the others .
3256,Excellent content and overview of the field. Appreciated the links to journal papers as extensions to the lecture notes. Course is let down somewhat by lecture notes that skim the surface too much to really be useful and outright errors in quizzes and assignments that will hinder completion unless you read through every forum post to find the missing information. (Quiz 13 was the worst offender).
3257,This is an excellent course. Hats off to Prof Hinton. I had a great time learning new things. Thank you!
3258,"Definitely not for beginners. Very advanced and the best NN course on the internet. I read Bishop's book, but I find this MOO very interesting."
3259,Excellent course. Thanks to Prof Geoffrey Hinton for such a detailed course covering so many topics in this key field.
3260,It lacks programming assignments and a base for understanding the algorithms exposed.
3261,"Great course, great teacher and great balance between theory and practise. Videos really need to understand the most difficult concepts"
3262,"Excellent material! Amazing to learn with one of the developers of NN.Unfortunately, there were lots of errors in the Quizzes and Assignments. Several questions could be answered only thanks to the help of other students that have had access to previous versions of the course.The mentors were at the beginning answering questions from the students that completed the course in the first couple of weeks and later disappeared. Then it was clearly in autopilot.Anyway, positive!It is necessary more hands on exercises to tight the theory with the practice. "
3263,"A great course to learn.Some quiz are broken, check forums often for that."
3264,"Hinton is the reason we use neural nets today. He's advanced the theory and continues to explore new approaches. This is eye opening. He motivates the theory behind each approach he advances very well. Unfortunately, the practical side of the pedagogy of this course is not as strong. It is understandable to not turn this into a programming class. However, there is too much of a gap between even a clear explanation of theory and actual practice. This could be remedied with more hands on exercises (not necessarily coding, though coding is a fine way to test understanding.)."
3265,Awesome course. Wish there were more programming assignments.
3266,"Sometimes it felt too fast paced, still I enjoyed it."
3267,Difficult but interesting course.
3268,I like this course because it not only explains the theory of neural computing but demonstrates neural networks ML with a lot of practical examples as well. It enlightened me in the applications of Machine Learning technologies. 
3269,Doesn't effectively explain how to implement the NN
3270,It's one of the most well structured and prepared Coursera courses I've ever attended. The instructor Professor Hinton is also one of the most famous Deep Neural Network scholars nowadays. 
3271,Simply: illuminating.
3272,"The Professor is making a great effort to make us understand the fundamentals of neural networks. But there is scope to make some topics in lecture 2 and 3 simpler by including notes on additional reading that is a prerequisite on linear algebra, calculus, and 3-D geometry. "
3273,interesting history of neural networks and excellent coverage of all main architectures.couple of problems during the quizzes. An update is needed!
3274,"Course content:The material is very cool, a lot of topics are covered. As for me, sometimes it was hard to understand the material because there weren't enough visualization and animation. Would be good to visualize/animate content more, like in Andrew's Ng ML course (less text, more visualization).Organization:Some links were broken, some quizzes/assignments were without files/pictures, so it is bad."
3275,no mouse to highlight on slide when teachingIt's a lot of unclear parts in slideI think cs231 is better
3276,"The course is a bit disorganized and could have been better. While the topics are really interesting and Geoffrey is really knowledgeable, a lot of simple concepts have been made seemly complicated from the way they have been presented -- often requiring external follow up studies (and often discovering in surprise how simple they actually are). such as, contrastive divergence (CD1) algorithm to train Restricted Bolazamann Machine (read wikipedia to get it in under 2 mins), functioning of sigmoid belief net etc. I believe, the issue arises from slides based teaching, where a slide of texts is presented and then there is a long monologue of how that system works from start to end. A more useful approach would have been to actually draw-and-talk (good example of such courses are Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Game Theory (esp. Kevin Leyton-Brown parts). Nonetheless, the course brings forth a lot of Neural Net topics and is definitely worth taking if you are willing to study outside the course also."
3277,Really great and interesting course.
3278,"It is complete and interesting overview of state of neural network today. I really enjoyed lectures and quizes. Unfortunately, there are a couple bugs in coursera quizzes that confused me. Yet, forum discussions helped pass the course."
3279,"Great course for learning Neural Networks. I learnt from the best, the God-Father of Neural Networks. Who you learn from is just as important as what you learn."
3280,Excellent course but need do a some research outside of the course to understand it
3281,"There is a lot of good information in here that is told poorly. Professor simply reads the slides to you for the most part, foregoing practical examples in favor of sticking to abstract concepts, and letting you figure out the details. Quizzes had errors in them that made passing them unnecessarily difficult. The slides that you could download are sometimes cutoff, leaving information out. This is very indicative of the classes I had in college, where the class was here are a bunch of whitepapers/books, read them, and you'll be an expert. There is little in the way of helping you understand these complicated concepts, and because they are complicated, many argue that should absolve the professor from needing to find a way to teach them in an understandable way (when other professors have been able to take complicated topics like this and distill it down to something that was both fun to learn and gave a solid foundation for going forward). I'm sure Professor Hinton has contributed much to the field, but I suspect his passion lies in playing with ideas and theories, not in trying to teach the next generation about how to do so."
3282,Great material
3283,A perfect introduction into the topic
3284,Awesome Syllabus to Learn. In depth lectures and 
3285,Well planned course.
3286,"The course is really good with a lot of intuition and technical details. The assignments and quizzes help clarify concepts and ideas. However the course requires a strong background in Mathematics and Statistics, so it may not be a course for people without such background.In addition, since the course has been out there for a few years, not many people joined my session and only a handful of people participated in the discussion forum. The forum has been quiet and not much help can be sought from the forum."
3287,"good , theoretical,but no new neural network technology . but ,if you understand the theoretical content , you will have one steady base to understand other new technology."
3288,"Programming exercises could be made more clear. Also, prior to each lecture, it would be useful to mention what specific papers or back ground material should be read to follow the lectures easily."
3289,"Definitely not an introductory course to machine learning, but even if you know nothing about the matter (like me) and have a fairly good understanding of mathematics, or are willing to use your spare time to catch up with linear algebra and calculus topics (again, like myself), you can still enjoy this course very much."
3290,"This was a superb course. I completely enjoyed it. There were a few technical issues with the assignments. But other than that, it was a top notch course."
3291,"Disappointing. The material is presented in such a way that it neither suits the mathematically inclined nor those interested a more hands-on introduction to neural networks. Some quizzes miss important figures and explanations, so that they can only be solved with the help of other students that have access to previous versions of the course.If this course should run for another session, the provider (University of Toronto) should decide on the proper audience and should also considerably revise the course. Given the flaws with the current session, it seems that the provider just wants to reap some easy money from students attracted by a current and interesting topic an a well-known name (Geoffrey Hinton). "
3292,Prof. Hinton has an interesting viewpoint on machine learning models other than neural networks. Watch videos in the later weeks.
3293,"There are some problems of the organization of the course. Some conditions and some images are missing in quizzes. Even some videos are missing. There's no official response in the forum. Thanks to the responses of other students in the forum, i can finally do some of the quizzes. It's really frustrating. "
3294,"In general, this course goes through some basic aspects of neural networks, which is suited for beginners. However, some parts of the course are not clearly explained, e.g. the sigmoid belief net, and there's some problems with the quizes."
3295,"Good course, but severely hobbled by the transition to the new platform. Many technical issues in the quizzes (such as questions not showing up, being marked incorrectly). Leaves the student feeling somewhat forgotten, which is a shame considering the brilliant material being presented."
3296,Great course for an introduction to neural networks.
3297,Very interesting material covered and in-depth views. Unfortunately a few technical issues in quizzes.
3298,Very good course
3299,"The course was ported to the new Coursera platform in a amateurish way without any testing. Learners have been complaining on the forums for months about bugs and missing information in the assessments, and they are still not fixed. The content is generally interesting, but not presented in a cohesive way. Many concepts are juggled with without giving clear, mathematical definitions."
3300,"This is very advanced course I have to say. As many people have already mentioned, it's very hard to learn. Quite often I feel frustrated, helpless and feel like banging my head against the wall. But if you quit complaining and trying to work it out by poking around the forum and goolging a bit, often you will understand and agree what the professor said. I think it's because it's such an advanced topic that you can't cover the depth and breadth in such a short course (yes, I know it's 16-week!). To compare it with Andrew Ng's ML course, After finishing the latter, I have much confidence and interest in ML. But after finishing this course, I feel I know so little and have greater respect for those who's already in this field. That's a good thing I think coz you don't have illusion that you master something but in actuality you don't. Both courses are great and give me valuable things. Andrew's Ng course prepares points me to the right direction and give me motivation while Professor Hinton's course prepares me with the mentality that the process will not be easy but very rewarding."
3301,"The pedagogy in this course is truly horrible. It is severely lacking concrete relevant real world examples - in the beginning of each lecture would be super - motivating each technique. This is kind of a dealbreaker. Furthermore the material is REALLY dry and theoretical, lacking pragmatic problem solving. IMO way too much time and energy is wasted on history, name-dropping and dry mathematical backrounds. Andrew Ng of Stanford University, with his course Machine Learning is a great example of how it can and should be done.Suffice to say it would be much more smoth, fun and efficient to start with 1) current real world relevant problem(s) motivating the technique, then 2) a clear description of the technique - with concrete examples mapping the theory to practice. This last part is super important and is what is lacking the most in the course. One more thing, the quizes and questions makes alot of silent and weird assumptions, often not even clearly relating to the lecture materials. There are also technical bugs and missing images in the quizes. Suffice to say this is a real dealbreaker."
3302,"Really great course. A couple of issues with missing lectures and problems with quizzes, but the quality and death of the content more than makes up for it. Fascinating and inspiring."
3303,"This is a great course offered by Coursera team. I really appreciate the coursera team and Professor Hinton for taking time to offer this excellent course. However, In order to make the best use of this course, I think having a basic understanding of NN would be very helpful because materials offered in the course are a little bit abstract and there is not enough time to go into details in these online courses. Also you can go deeper into this topic by understanding details of the codes provided to you (not only the parts you have to complete for the sake of assignment). Overall, it is a great complementary course on NN."
3304,"this course is incredible boring. I'm really interested in the topic, but the way it is presented is just sad. only theory and slides with way too much text. I've already taken several ML classes and this one is still hard to follow. Can't recommend it."
3305,"I found the course rather difficult, with respect to the other courses I did on Coursera. In my opinion part of the reason I found it difficult is that the material is not explained very well. Hinton is certainly a guru in Machine Learning, but I found him a bit boring as a teacher and often I thought he was explaining some details but failing to give the broader picture. I must admit I did not read the extra material provided with the course (the long articles) but only focused on the videos, slides and tests, perhaps had I read the articles I would have struggled less. I also did the course in 9 weeks instead of 16, but I did watch most videos twice so I feel I did dedicate some time to it. I much preferred Andrew Ng's course, and I strongly recommend doing that one first. I am also loving the University of Washington's Machine Learning specialization, but since I have been wating for the next course in that specialization for a while, I did Hinton's course in the mean time. That said, I did find this course useful, although I often felt somewhat frustrated."
3306,"The material is not presented in a cohesive manner. In video questions are not very good and don't make sense often. Since this is the only course of its kind on coursera, you don't have many options either. The material seems very arbitrary and even with a basic knowledge of machine learning, and advanced mathematics it is difficult to understand the first week and the types of neurons presented, understanding which is essential I think."
3307,This is an absolutely excellent course for those wanting a serious overview of neural networks. I would very highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in really going deep in the area.I would not however recommended this as an introductory machine learning class for someone unfamiliar with the area.
3308,"Very inteligent course and quizesHowever, there are a few bugs in the grading system, check the relevant forums if your answers are wrongly indicated as mistakes"
3309,Great course :)
3310,"Informative. I spent way more time on the programming assignments than the posted estimate. There was an error in the text for Programming Assignment 4 that was really frustrating; but luckily, someone had found the correct way to do it and had posted it on the forum. The intuition explanations during the lectures were great. All-around great course."
3311,"It is easy to brute force answers, which means, that those, who know it don't consider its certificate seriously and this reduces the importance of the certificate"
3312,Difficulty level just right. Interesting. Well presented.
3313,"The content of this course is not self-contained. You need to search and read extra materials to fill some knowledge gaps. Besides, some of the videos are missing and some quiz are not well clarified. Well, given all the complaints, the instructor is of no doubt one of the best in this field. The topics in this course is worth exploring using your own time."
3314,"extremely well done ! highly recommend it ! The professor, the method and the content are incredibly good."
3315,"Absolutely loved this course. Warning: it's not really aimed at beginners. You probably want to do Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course first, play around with the ideas a bit, and then have a go at this one. In terms of style, this course feels a bit like a 'research level' course at a university. That is, the lectures cover a lot of material, at quite a high level. To get the most out of it, you're going to have to sit down after the course and spend some time coding up the ideas. Though I think that's a bonus.In terms of presentation, I thought the lectures were pretty clear and engaging. The course is originally from 2012, and covers material that was cutting edge at the time - including results that were still unpublished. I'd love to see an updated version of this course."
3316,Help me a lot in understanding some difficult concepts.
3317,"It is a great privilege to learn neural networks by Prof. Hinton, a giant in the field of neural networks, and I am grateful for that. This course is excellent as a broad introduction to neural networks. Prof. Hinton conveys a lot of intuition and technical details, and for people like me, who has no experience in neural networks sometimes it is difficult to see the forest for the trees. "
3318,Very Good!.
3319,"This course is good, unique and relevant for machine learning today. Some things can be improved though. Starting around weeks 11-12 the lectures become a bit vague, and I had quite some difficulty understanding them. It seemed to me that these lectures were hastily created (even though I can only imagine how much work creating this course must have been). Furthermore, the lab sessions are rather easy and the provided code is annoying to work with systematically since they output results as printed text instead of something re-usable. This makes experimentation (like grid searches) a bit tedious. Besides these minor things, the course is quite good.Note that deep learning topics are only briefly touched, but you won't obtain the skills for training and designing them yourself without further exploration of the topics.Finally, many thanks to the teachers!"
3320,Great course with awesome theory. The quizzes are great and help to re-inforce the conceptsImprovement area is availabililty of exercises in R &amp; Python and more programming assignments. Only 2 programming assignments are a shame
3321,"Really liked the course. The concepts were explained thoroughly, and I think I can apply some of the things I learned directly. Only downside was, that it is using Octave ."
3322,"Thank you for the great course. Going in, I thought all NNs were feed-forward so this really expanded my view and understanding. Minor issues with test mechanics but those were a small distraction."
3323,This course is just great!
3324,"This is a really deep dive into neural networks. It is highly theoretical, and includes deep details, and some optional deep mathematics in the subject. Hence, I do not consider this course as an introduction course on neural networks. I will not recommend this course to anyone who is just started learning about neural networks. However I do indeed recommend this course to anyone who would love to have a deep understanding of neural networks, and already has the basic understanding of neural networks and RBMs. If you've never used a neural network, never heard of backpropagation, or never got the basic understanding of RBMs, then this is not the course for you. If you a passionate about neural networks, have used them earlier, and what to get a deep understanding, this is indeed the course for you. I consider this a Ph.D level course. Thank you Professor Hinton for sharing some of your deep knowledge to the Coursera community."
3325,"Should have a bigger practical component. Also, there are a lot of technical problems with the course."
3326,I'm really amazed how well the essential concepts of NNs are organized and precisely explained in this course.
3327,"I love the well-designer questions that evaluate my understanding of the topic. and the explanation feedback is good, too."
3328,Great Course
3329,"Great, moderately advanced material, that will boost your knowledge on neural nets."
3330,"Comparing with Andrew Ng's course, this one goes into more details and is also more update to date with new techs like LSTM. Haven't finish yet but definitely 5 star!"
3331,"There are few typos and missing videos in the archive, but overall this is a top level quality course. It's not an easy one, can be a good follow-up course after professor Andrew Ng's machine learning course."
3332,loved this course. It's the best one i found on this topic!
3333,"Quizzes were buggy, but the lectures were good"
3334,Such an amazing course. I'd recommend it for anyone interested in machine learning and wants a more in-depth introduction to the field of neural networks.
3335,"I really like this course. Geoffrey Hinton is one of the very best researchers in Neural Networks in the world. I gave it 4 stars (instead of 5) for substandard implementation of its tests (misaligned questions and missing question content) and programming exercises (missing supporting documentation and code). I was able to get through this problems by googling it, but this was frustrating. Once this problems are sorted out, this course will be really enjoyable. "
3336,Great introduction to neural networks and deep learning. Hinton is legend.
3337,This course offers a unique opportunity to learn about neural nets from one of the people who developed the current state of the art. 
3338,Great course
3339,Awesome 
3340,"A very good, quite difficult, comprehensive course. Octave is mentioned but I believe anything can be used (I'll be using Python) because the assignments only ask for results, not the code. It's not for beginners, concepts are well explained and course is taught to a high standard."
3341,hard to follow.. usually I don't know what is he talking about..
3342,Super interesting
3343,Great
3344,Waiting for long time for such excellent course
3345,"Not clear illustration??? many problems are not directly related to the content covered. More importantly, it sucks!"
3346,"Breadth / depth of content is great. Biggest issue is lectures &amp; slides to not always tell you everything you need to know to take the tests &amp; assignments - best to take Andrew Ng's course first and be ready to search on Google to find things you don't understand. Also check discussion forums, some of the quizzes actually have errors (!!) you cannot pass unless you know how to fix the questions. Kind of surprising :("
3347,"Amazing course, with a very interesting historic overview throughout the subjects, a focus on intuitive understandment, and advanced materials to keep everyone happy."
3348,"There was no support from admins/moderators/assistants. There was a buggy quiz which we would all have failed, if I did not find an old version of it on the web. This is unacceptable and clearly exposes the differences between real courses and MOOCs. "
3349,Amazing!! Gave me a deeper insight into Artificial Intelligence. 
3350,Good
3351,Thank you Professor Hinton for making such a comprehensive and insightful course!
3352,So useful to start with neural networks and get the bases
3353,"I got a lot of knowledge about deep learning from the course, thanks!"
3354,Very recommending people who want to learn more about neural networks learn this course. The course is hard for me but latter I will take a good review to this.
3355,This is the best course I've ever taken on Coursera. Extremely thorough and covers years worth of research and insights about neural networks.
3356,"Althoght math is a bit difficult, this course is a wonderful start for me to start the journey of deep learning! "
3357,"I feel overloaded with information and knowledge, but that feeling is appreciated and very welcome. I would like to thank the team behind the Coursera and Professor Hinton and his team."
3358,All you need.
3359,"Tough going in places, but mind blowing. Geoffrey Hinton gives thorough explanations and really goes into detail of Neural Networks. A great follow up to Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course."
3360,"There is a lot of material to cover however, I think the professor and his crew do a good job on touching the most important points. The discussion group is also extremely helpful. I would suggest adding either more materials or recommended links for those willing to dig further into the mathematics details of some topics (RBMs for instance), as the material shown in the slides is way too sparse sometimes. The practical assignments were well planned and extremely useful and helpful to master some of the concepts, thanks for that. I am in the process of cleaning up the code in a way that I believe would be easier for students to understand them. I will contribute them back to the course in case there is any interest. Thanks!"
3361,"The excellent lecture on NN. It covers a wide variety of issues on NN throughout. However, it is sometimes difficult to understand. More explanation on basic concepts and the maths behind would help."
3362,"The course covers the cornerstones of neural nets architectures, learning, optimization and regularization techniques. Helps to get a grip on the terminology of the field, and to develop an intuition of how things work."
3363,It's a good course to learn about the algorithms behind neural networks and how they work.
3364,"geof hinton is top in neural nets. in this course he gives great intuition without much math (wchich is at the same time good and bad,i personally was really intersted in the math so i spent much time looking it up, but not a single second is to be taken for wasted. worth it!). covers the up to date techniques on n.n.'s, in really great depth. each week i wondered where should it end. i'm glad to say each week was building on the last and in the end i can say i have an understanding of what's out there, what i need to read, who are some people i should follow, and prof hinton is one of them!"
3365,This is a tough course. The quizzes and assigments are even tougher. One needs a lot of dedication to succed in this course.
3366,The best neural networks course available!
3367,Great course for us to learn neural networks.
3368,You can learn a lot about the neural networks but only if you make your way through low quality video lectures and buggy quizzes/assignments. Geoffrey Hinton is a great scientist but it looks like he is not a good teacher. 
3369,"Great course about Neural Networks,a lot of theory,a lot of challenges,but helps a lot.Thanks everyone who participate in this course.Thank you!"
3370,A great course! George Hinton is one of the best teachers at Machine Learning
3371,This is one of the best courses I have ever been taught in my life. Thank you Professor Geoffrey Hinton and Coursera.
3372,Very good to get a good idea about some of the neural network techniques. The assignments are very well designed to help understand the concepts rather than making one do the entire coding.Very useful if you want to know the feel of the subject as well as get to know some concepts in not very deep level.
3373,The best course I've taken on Coursera!
3374,This course is very deep. May not be very friendly without much prior knowledge in machine learning or matlab programming.
3375,very good for the people who wants to learn neural networks
3376,"A thorough introduction to Neural Networks, really enjoyed the course!"
3377,"Great course, nice introduction to neural networks. Can make better elaboration in discussion."
3378,"Hinton's intuition about the models presented in this course is brilliant. He also does an excellent job of passing that intuition to the viewers. That is, without doubt, the #1 reason this course is great. There are many resources in the internet that provide the same information as this course, but none of them can provide that intuition. The later parts of the course is a little low on math, and perhaps those can be explored in optional videos, but they can also be found elsewhere on the internet.The pacing of the course is also great, as it always builds on top of the previously learnt material. There are a couple of mistakes in quizzes and assignments, and there is even a missing video on one of the weeks that is essential to passing one of the quizzes. These flaws, however, do not make this learning experience worse; they are but hindrances that can be solved by looking at the forums.What actually hinders the course is the subpar first three assignments. There is little direction in what you should do and how you should approach the assignment, and you spend most of your time to make sure your code works with the rest of the stuff that's already written for you, instead of coding for yourself. There is also little you can do to see if there are errors in your code. The last assignment, however, is just what I would like to see from an assignment at Coursera, with the program logic clearly separated to different files for better visibility, multiple steps to the assignment &amp; checks in between for us to make sure each step was completed successfully.Overall, I would recommend this course to all who wants to learn the basics of neural nets and why they work the way they do. Even if you have some basic knowledge on neural nets &amp; backpropogation, there will be useful information here."
3379,complete and interesting
3380,"This is a very interesting course that blends theory, intuition and practice but it is also demanding, also in time. It covers a lot of different topics, and is a fantastic overview of neural networks - perhaps with a slight bias to the work/interests of Professor Hinton, which is fully okay :) - but probably too difficult as a first course - I would recommend taking a basic neural network course prior to taking this course. "
3381,Excelent course to introduce the world of Neural Networks.
3382,"The course consists of 2 principal parts:1 - Deterministic models (feed-forward, conv, recurrent NNs)2 - Probabilistic models (Hopfield nets, Boltzmann machines, Deep Belief Nets)The first part is really well explained and brings a lot of understanding and practical knowledge. I'd recommend this course to anyone just because of this one. The second part is much more theoretical and requires much deeper knowledge in probability theory. The author tries hard to explain all the concepts without touching too much maths but it makes things only worse. It's impossible to understand this topic without going outside of the course's agenda.Also it would be nice to have more involved programming assignments. While current assignments make a point I see that there is still an enormous potential for improvement. Some topics are not covered at all in practice, e.g. convolutional and recurrent nets.Nevertheless this course absolutely fantastic. It gives you this feeling of becoming an expert in something.Also I want to thank Geoffrey Hinton for his contribution to the field of AI and this course. And I can't refrain from making a compliment about lecturer's absolutely adorable English pronunciation and a subtle sense of humor."
3383,"Deep and interesting introduction to machine learning and neural networks. Pace of this course was perfect for me, not too much work for every week, nevertheless it took considerable time to study all material and to complete all assignments in time."
3384,"Hinton was GREAT! A very insightful course on NN, with a lot of practical knowledges. Theory is a bit thin; there are also quite some flaws in course documents and videos (noticed by many viewers). But it doesn't change the usefulness of this course. Thank you Prof. Hinton and TAs."
3385,Very interesting course; not easy to consume but diverse and challenging; the whole concept of Boltzmann networks and belief nets was new to me &gt; great!
3386,"Great course, extremely informative and useful. A bit tough sometimes but totally worth it."
3387,"The course needs some updating, mostly in some quizzes with wrong data. Also, some of the programming assignments (specially programming asignment 3) need a little more theory. But this course is really awesome. You need to know this stuff if you mean to work with NN."
3388,Excellent explanation by prof. Hinton who invented tones of things in the field of artificial neural networks. Mechanics is clearly justified with intuition behind it.
3389,"For those who want more than just a hands on intro to neural networks this is the course for you. I've been through many resources that treat Neural Nets as a black box which, while being a fine intro, fails to give me the understanding required to do anything other than follow a tutorial. I feel like after this course I understand what's happening enough to start reading papers and thinking on my own."
3390,"The first 10 lectures, while quite theoretical, are very useful to most people learning Deep Learning for practical tasks. Last few lectures are heavily focused on RBMs and might not be immediately relevant, but are great for the historical perspectives and for people interested in more advanced aspects of Deep Learning."
3391,"Thanks Hinton and all other stuff for the great course. I spent less than one month in learning and passing this course. I don't know if I am the one quickest. I am sure I have not got all knowledge points and I will continue working on and will make deeper understanding in future work. But, I did pass it in such a short time. I was very challenge journey. I would like to share how I made it. 1) I did investigation on Linear algebra and Statistics for about 1 years that helps me a lot in understanding the math ???such conditional possibility, PCA etc. ??? quickly. 2) Before taking this course, I learned Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course. It helped me a lot in understanding the basic concept of learning theory.(such as overfitting etc.. ) . Without that experience, I would have not pass this course so quickly. 3) I did programming work for many year though I am a fresh hand on Octave. It makes coding work is not that much challenging. "
3392,"This is a very thorough introductory course to the field of Machine Learning. I would have given it 5 stars, but towards the end, I felt the lessons got a bit sloppier. New concepts not thoroughly explained, sloppier slides, and even a lecture video missing at one point (had to find a link to it on youtube)! Still a very solid, instructive course, though. Recommended!"
3393,Excellent course! Hinton is a superstar in the field who has made many discoveries in neural networks. He does an excellent job of explaining a number of key techniques. One of the best features was his commentary on the intuition behind why these methods work. Since he came up with a number of these ideas himself (or was part of the team that did) he has a unique insight into how you can think about a problem to motivate a possibly fruitful approach. The other aspect of the course that I liked best was Hinton's copious use of real-world examples and feedback about which methods worked well on certain problems and why. The course is fairly challenging but well worth the effort. Thank you for sharing your insights Professor Hinton!
3394,"Nice course, though a little shallow."
3395,"Mathematically intense, would like to repeat the course to understand the material even better. It has made me worthy of reading the research papers in this area... Thanks for this great course."
3396,Best choice for learning NN! :-)
3397,"Prof. Hinton's course was my first Coursera experience and I liked it a lot. A lot of tasks of very different levels! And even if you are familiar with calculus/linear algebra some things will still be challenging. P.S. Couple of slides in the course were missing, but I hope this will be fixed soon."
3398,Thanks Prof. Hinton and Coursera. This is one of the best courses I've ever taken. I learned a lot about neural networks and deep learning!
3399,"An all round introduction to the field of neural networks, using a historical perspective, and looking deeply in to the theory. The lecturer is the godfather of neural networks, gives a good perspective of recent research by his group and others. The course has limited programming assignments (in matlab/octave), that don't really give you a good idea how to implement the ideas in the course. This is why 4 stars not 5.However, the phenomenal ideas presented, and the in depth theory, mean I am now bursting to teach myself how to build these systems, because they are so fascinating. "
3400,"The course is super interesting. However, the lectures could be better explained and the material better organized. I found myself constantly looking online for extra material to better understand the concepts. Also, you can tell that the course is not anymore groomed and there are some mistakes in a quiz due to lack of care. In any case, the course is very recommendable to start with neural networks"
3401,Masterful
3402,A little Difficult to understand
3403,"Awesome content, I leaned a lot"
3404,"I recommend this course for theoretical knowledge only. I was very upset with the programming assignments - they are few, they are not consistent in difficulty level and the way they being checked is not convenient. "
3405,Than you professor Hinton for a challenging course!
3406,"I would not recommend it as the first course in Machine Learning, but it is really great as a second course on the subject. Highly recommended for those who want to learn neural networks in more details than offered by typical machine learning courses."
3407,"I learned quite a lot that I can use for research, personal projects, and general understanding of neural networks, but unfortunately this course is getting quite out of date at this point. I would recommend to others looking for a first course in neural networks (for machine learning applications) look for a newer course."
3408,"Love, just love. It is a tough class, but I feel much satisfaction of finishing it. "
3409,"The content is theoretical, meanwhile, the application (code) is not enough to help understanding. The knowledge requirement actually is not to high. But the reading-presentation style make the class obscure. Now so easy to learn is you just follow the video. You may need to review previous chapters to try find the hidden details or google if you found you dont know what the professor are saying."
3410,great!
3411,Course presents an amazing set of topics form experience which spans over several decades. Professor is leading name in the field. I was extremely delighted with programming assignments which are very illustrative and well designed.Greatest minus to the course goes to lecturing approach which basically boils down to reading the slides. Additional literature in form of papers and publications are necessary to completely understand lectures. 
3412,Currently one of the best courses I have ever seen about ML (and especially about neural networks).
3413,Neural Networks for Machine Learning course is very useful for the people who would like to enter into Artificial Intelligence area. Thanks for the great content.
3414,"Some the work is quite hard, but trudging through it really helps understand the topic. I feel I can now read research papers that use neural networks."
3415,it is a good launching point towards further concepts in Neural Networks / Deep Learning algorithms. The course is at the right level of challenge and right level of introducing notions and concepts. Side reading / learning is strongly recommended for audiences from the quantitative field without exposures in Machine Learning.
3416,"Great course. I especially liked the quality of the assignments, that are challenging and force students to think over the courses. The only problem is that I would like to have 50% longer version that gives details on all the aspects."
3417,Great course! have Learned a lot!
3418,Awesome course. 
3419,This is an advanced course and there are a lot of things that Geoffrey Hinton talks about casually which one has to read more about on one's own. The knowledge and clarity of the instructor is beyond doubt top notch. This course if quiet exhaustive and perhaps the best course on neural networks.
3420,Very nice way of explaining important concepts. The assignments were engaging. Learnt a lot about Neural Networks which will help me in the future. 
3421,"This is a great course. Unlike Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, this course does not shy away from using real mathematics to explain the models being studied, and is all the better for it. Some of the explanations were a little mysterious to this student (e.g. how can you discuss sampling of restricted Boltzmann machines, which are essentially bipartite Ising models, without mentioning conditional probability?). However, Professor Hinton motivated everything so well that I always *wanted* to understand what was going on, and so frequently would pause the videos while I consulted other online resources to find out more about the topic at hand. The programming assignments were also well-designed, so that I found myself forced to confront various aspects of the models and algorithms that I'd thought I'd understood the first time round but in fact had not. Thank you Professor Hinton."
3422,Amazing course taught by the mystro himself !! 
3423,"Great course, I learned a lot about neural networks. I apprechiate there have been also difficult excercises. Also the programming skills are challenged."
3424,"A little bit hard to follow, but I endured to the end"
3425,Awesome course with lots of hidden gems of insight. Hinton's bury the lead lecturing style makes every video a treasure hunt. Students get to discover those pearls of wisdom if they listen carefully and read between the lines.
3426,Great course if you wish to learn about various neural network architectures and the tasks they perform best at
3427,"The course provides you with very valuable information. Even though it is quite hard and sometimes the information is not explained well enough for people who are just starting in the field, it is worth the effort. I took Andrew Ng's course first and this course after that. Andrew Ng's course gives good introduction into Machine Learning and this course gives you much deeper insights."
3428,Fantastic course for learning the ropes and gaining intuition.
3429,Very out of date.
3430,Great content. Teaching style could be improved for the medium. A couple of errors that should be rectified. The course seems poorly maintained. It is pity because it is content really valuable and hot.
3431,Great course: a lot of effort has gone into preparing it. It's a great way to get an overview of and insight into the field from a pre-eminent authority.
3432,Excelent.
3433,"Very good material and videos. However, quite a few mistakes in the quizzes and programming assignments (missing information, incorrect answers, etc) which requires a frustrating dig through the forums for errata mentioned by other users that was never incorporated into the actual tests."
3434,"Excellent course. Giving a broad introduction to different neural network approaches, while teaching a skill level allowing a comfortable start in using neural networks. "
3435,"Very nice course. It was a privilege to learn the subject from one of the best teams in the world. However, the course was harder than I expected, most probably because I could not spend much time on the videos and text, and expected to receive everything prepared for me beforehand. So be prepared to spend some time to grasp the ideas if you do not know much about the subject beforehand."
3436,"Covers a very broad range of topics, but each topics could be explained much more in-depth. Requires a lot of reading outside the course to complete. Could use much more than just four programming assignments."
3437,"Very helpful explanations if you already have some idea of what's going on. Can be a struggle if you come in with no context.I'd never heard of Hopfield Nets or Boltzmann Machines and I found it difficult to understand what was going on in the last few weeks. I think I was missing intuition and having many more concrete examples might have helped. On the other hand, for example, I already knew a few ideas behind convolution neural networks and the lectures cleared a lot up. The explanations are solid, though perhaps graze over some important things for newcomers. The next step for me is probably to rewatch weeks 11-14 now that I'm no longer a newcomer on that topic..."
3438,"This is a great course overall, even though it is a bit dated and a lot of more recent developments are not covered. There was also a mistake in one of the quizes, where they forget to mention that the values of the variables should be changed. Fortunately, someone realized that the new values were given in an old version of the quiz."
3439,a bit tough and abstract but it is worth the effortreally gets you up to speed with current NN methods
3440,The course is very good and covers neural networks at a detailed conceptual level. The course gave me a very good idea about the important concepts in this area through well structured chapters and programming assignments. I thank the organizers of this course (especially Prof. Hinton) heartily for conducting such an important and timely course. Thanks again ! 
3441,Great course to understand the mathematics behind neural networks and deep learning. Combined with some practical courses would provide learners much strong background and skills to enter deep learning world. Recommended.
3442,"The field has developed quickly, the course covers many classical theories in the field. I suggest those read the deep learning book www.deeplearningbook.org for reference"
3443,"great content, probably better with more programming exercises"
3444,"Great course, looking forward to part 2.Thank you prof. Hinton!"
3445,"The course is an advanced one and not really suggested for a beginner who would want to understand basic concepts. Also during the course, the teaching was fast and there was lot of content to understand. The practice programs contained lot of code which was confusing for a learner like me. Hence, hoping that these shortcomings will be sorted out as and when the course profile is updated."
3446,"It is a great course, but requires a lot of additional readings and study. Compared to Andrew Ng's Machine learning this course should be seen as more an intermediate/advanced level. This course should be seen as a complementary to the Andrew Ng's class, as discuss in more detail neural networks. "
3447,This course is very benefial for student. 
3448,"The content presented in this course is really complete and well presented. It is definitively worth taking. Unfortunately, there were a few organization errors like missing video and quizzes errors. On a side note, it's great to be able to learn from Hinton since he has created many of the techniques presented in the course. "
3449,"Most remarkable course. Well put together and organized. Learned a great deal, the class has also stimulated my curiosity for delving deeper into the field of deep learning."
3450,"Wonderful course, its not easy, for sure, but what else could you expect from Geoff Hinton :)"
3451,Teaching and lectures are complicated. would be better if more simple language and examples were used
3452,Solid
3453,"Very well done course! Absolutely brilliant lectures. Quizzes sometimes have questions that would be difficult/impossible to answer without additional resources, but on the whole, this is a course that I would certainly take again."
3454,"While I learned quite a bit from the course, I found the course to be far more difficult and frustrating than it really needed to be. Mentors were unhelpful and generally unresponsive during the course, course content was broken and/or missing, and the level of background in both calculus/probability needed to truly understand the material in this course was not obvious at all from the beginning. In general, the holistic experience of this course was disappointing and frankly, I would not recommended it unless you have a strong enough math background or are a glutton for punishment."
3455,"A hard course, but very useful. It helped me a lot"
3456,Prof Hinton is the champion on NN. Glad to spend my time on this course.
3457,"Great course! Amazing opportunity to be taught by G. Hinton, probably the world leading academic in this area. "
3458,"Excellent lectures; Hinton conveys depth and theoretical clarity along with practical, down to earth advice on how to get useful things done without wasting time. Unfortunately the staff did a rather spotty job of updatating and maintaining the problem sets and I had to repeatedly find corrections from other students on the forums since apparently no one was fixing the problem sets in response to the forum discussions. Shameful since they are taking our money; it would only take someone a couple of hours to fix it up. "
3459,Thanks every one
3460,"Overall, a good and challenging course that covered a range of material from perceptrons to feed forward nets and Deep Belief Networks. However, I felt that some of the material is a little dated - convolutional neural networks did not get the coverage warranted by their recent successes. Some of the quiz items were off-syllabus too, although this encouraged further reading. I enjoyed the programming exercises, particularly on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and would have liked more of them. For beginners I would recommend they take Andrew Ng's course first."
3461,Thank you for the great foundation course. It would be great if the course introduces more up-to-date methods/results in NN.
3462,"very useful course, but i have understood about 80%)))"
3463,A very good introductory course in neural networks. Hats-off to Professor Hinton!
3464,Very helpful for understanding neural network.
3465,"The course looks like a part of something more detailed, complicated and wide. The most interesting part is dedicated to last algorithmic solutions for Restricted Boltzmann Machine and their connections to net. "
3466,"I took this course after completing the excellent Andrew Ng one on Machine Learning. That course was a good broad overview but I felt left me needing to know more about neural networks, deep learning recurrent neural networks, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief nets etc. This course was excellent in taking me to the next level. I now fee I understand many more of the papers, tools and models that I am seeing and am better equipped to both setup and use the same.The course is delivered in a very different way, much more of a high level overview with lots of very valuable insights that point the student in the right direction rather than providing all of the details. As a result you have to do quite a lot of independent thinking and research to answer the quizzes and assignments. Personally I enjoyed the challenge but it might not be to everybody's taste. One area where I think things could be improved is in that of the quiz integrity and of mentor support. There was very little evidence of mentors supporting students in the forums and several of the quiz questions were incorrectly setup with for example the wrong set of weights given so it was impossible to get the right answer until somebody found data from the internet that was from a previous version of the course.Overall despite the above issues I would very much recommend the course and am very glad I did it. Thanks to the team at Toronto that put it all together."
3467,"Good for understanding the various types of neural networks, but I had hoped to spend more time learning methods for optimizing model fitment."
3468,"The breadth of the content was good, but the depth, particularly with the recurrent networks from later weeks, was a bit lacking. There were a few quiz problems I spent a while on, only to check the discussion section and realize that the information/image provided was inaccurate. The coding assignments could be slightly more frequent. Overall, this was a good course. It seems like it would be difficult to give a thorough treatment of this topic by simply watching these lectures and taking the quizzes/programming assignments. I think this course is best used for introductions to various topics/authors, which can then be used as a stepping stone for more intricate, individual study on those topics."
3469,"Great course! The course provides intensive but very well-organized contents, I have learnt a lot from it. There is no time-wasting explanation in the lectures. $49 is the most worth amount of money I had spent in recent years. Wish coursera provide more high quality courses like this. "
3470,MATERIALS NOT WELL PREPARED
3471,"Difficult, awesome, brilliant and life changing course- will leave you thinking for the rest of your career. It took me two tries to even begin to grasp some of the concepts. Once you get on the track, be prepared to be amazed. It changed the way I look at a problem and changed my career goal as well. I would like see more courses from G. Hinton. You are rightfully called the Godfather of Deep Learning. Wish you all the best."
3472,"very good course, it gives us the information of the state of the art of deep learning until 2012, also how were neural networks built to being the most important tecnology nowadays.some material and assignements new to be updated, but anyway the experience was awsome, nevertheless to feel good with this course also is needed machine learning pre-concepts, and some calculus, be able to adapt to diferente terminology of kind of topics, becuase the content is very long, but fancy"
3473,"Excellent course to learn both fundamentals and state of the art techniques in NN. Ant it's taught by Hinton, who is one of the fathers of NN/Deep Learning !"
3474,good overview but not up to date and some errors in quizes
3475,I liked the content of this course and for the most part I thought it was pretty decent. I just felt that the lectures needed a bit more structure since there didn't seem to be a very good transition between topics. The some of the quiz questions in this course were broken since they were missing details that we crucial to answering the questions (missing weights or having wrong answers since the posted values didn't align with the answer).
3476,excellent
3477,It has a few missing conditions in some of quizs. So it spend more time to solve it. But it's still a good course to learn the basic of deep learning.
3478,"Very good course for someone who wants to feel of neural net, deep belief net and RBM. Geoffrey is awesome. You will be able learn and understand neural net intuitively. "
3479,Awsome
3480,The course material was useful however greatly disappointed with the organisation. Many quizzes had in-complete questions (no figures) and there was no corrections made. I had to resort to checking through forums for the correct questions. 
3481,"Very good and interesting introduction to neural networks. I particularly appreciated the history behind the different types of neural networks so that one understands where the basic ideas come from. I was however a bit disappointed in terms of mathematics, the course could have used a bit more mathematical formalism and some more hands on exercises. Still, I warmly recommend this course!"
3482,I learned a lot about deep learning. However the quiz contains several mistakes and I wasted many hours. I also thought explanation is unnecessarily hard to understand.
3483,"This is a great mathematical course to understand what's going on, but the assignments and quizzes are just repetitive and basically run these commands. Professor Hinton definitely knows his stuff, and just sitting through his lectures was worth the time. That being said, Week 13 is busted as of 2017-1-22, Question 6 and 7 use variables values that are never mentioned. The only way I passed it was to google an old version of the course in Chinese that had a line saying please use these other variables"
3484,"Good balance of theory, practice, historical background and humor. I finally learned how to do back-propagation on paper :)"
3485,"You can get many knowledge from this course, but you have to be prepared. Actually learning course gives me no pleasure. It is not complete, you have to guess many things and find additional materials somewhere else to pass all course quizzes and assignments. BTW some quizzes are invalid. I think there was some issues while migrating to updated coursera version, that is why some course materials lost."
3486,Very good content!
3487,"The course is very interesting and detailed but maybe too technical in some parts.Also, some (not too sporadic) errors and missing pieces of information in the questions made quizzes even harder to pass. The discussions on the forum were of great help in this sense, though."
3488,"Good teaching, good tests and exams (even to procrastinators xp , nice dynamics for programming assignments."
3489,"This course is deep. I spent hours on some of the quizzes and assignments, viewing many of the videos several times over. Ng's ML course (also excellent) is like an undergrad course. Hinton's is like a graduate level course. Lots of background reading, covering a wide range of topics. Having completed the course, I believe I've gotten a good grounding in current thinking on machine learning."
3490,Very interesting course. It gives you a quite deep understanding of Neural Networks and Deep Learning. An excellent starting point to start mastering these technique. 
3491,Very informative program and sets the beginning on neural network. I would like to see more practical examples on the application of these algorithm
3492,Prof Hinton shares all his knowledge in designing an award-winning neural network. This is less a hands-on course but is more a very profound teaching of deep learning theory. If you can understand everything that is taught in this course then you will be the next genius that comes up with the next bleeding edge neural nets. That's not for me though as I struggled from week to week till the end but I learned a lot. Many thanks to Prof Hinton for generously sharing his knowledge and insights in this topic. 
3493,"Overall I really loved this course, and taking it from such an important name in the field was cool. There were a number of technical glitches on the quizzes, unfortunately, and often the wording on quizzes was unnecessarily confusing (but still manageable) so I dock it a single star. Also the visual organization of the lecture slides is a little shoddy compared to many other versions of nearly identical slides from Hinton's courses found online elsewhere. On the mobile app, many of the quiz questions were impossible to complete because graphics could not load. Not sure if it's a problem with the course materials or with the app or with my device, so that has not affected my rating. For anyone considering this course, be advised that ability in calculus and statistics are required for mastery of this material."
3494,"A good course that covers everything there is about Neural Networks - from history to the very latest topics in this domain. Not to mention that the instructor - Prof. Hinton, is a pioneer and leading researcher in this field. People may find Prof. Hinton's teaching style a little different/difficult to follow initially, but please do stick with him and it gets better. And the supplementary reading material contains some of the best research papers on the topics and is a must read for everyone taking this course. Overall a very good course to take if one is interested in ML and NNs."
3495,"Good course, but is not so well interpreted. In some cases, I really donot understand what does the lecturer talks about."
3496,"I have mixed feelings about this course. On one hand, scope is ambitious and getting to attend a course by G Hinton is a luxury. On the other hand, some topics are addressed confusingly (e.g. Hopfield Nets) or without going into much detail. But I think the worst of this course, and I wish Coursera would take care of that, is some quizzes being completely broken (missing or incorrect data), forcing you to go to Forums to get the correct question.There are big gaps of data and no course biography to follow or complete the missing gaps (lecture resources, when available, is just papers on the topic). Also, the course would benefit from better programming exercises... as it stands it is just download a program, complete a couple of methods, fill in the gaps on a quiz"
3497,loved the course. learnt a lot about neural networks
3498,"The videos and the papers presented gave a full overview about the last 3 decades on neuro network research. The course has very tough concepts (RBM, Sigmoid Belief Networks, LSTM), but it can be followed if you have a solid background in math or computer science. The exercises in Octave were well designed to introduce concepts and to give a hands on about how to tune neuro networks. The unique point to improve this course is that there some mistakes in quizzes from 1 or 2 weeks related with missing images (wrong weights to calculate anwsers). The forum helped a lot, but it could be fixed to avoid more complaints. Apart from this minor issue, it is an excellent course from this exciting and promising field."
3499,"Great course, highly informative. The generative models parts is especially interesting. "
3500,"Great material, it is amazing that lectures by one of the most influential people in the neural network for machine learning community are freely available for everyone. The course could benefit from additional topics that appeared over the last 1-2 years (GANs for instance). There was a number of problems with quizes like missing parts of question descriptions, missing images or broken links."
3501,"The course gives I think a good overview over the concepts of neural networks and the teaching material is good. However generally the course is more advanced than I suspected, so it took me much more time then what is given for the lectures / quizzes to complete it. If you are not already familiar with the concepts and/or have a strong mathematical background it can be sometimes frustrating :-) One thing that definitively needs improvement is that 2 times the questions of the quizzes were corrupted (parts were missing). Not sure if this was due to the material itself or a bug in the Cousera platform. So look in the discussion forum if you find something strange in the quizzes."
3502,"Brilliant course! I have reviewed this course many times, learning more each time, and I cannot thank Professor Hinton and Coursera enough for making this course available. This course was first offered 4 years ago, but the material (as of 2017) is still quite fresh and relevant, and I would say 'required' for anyone who wants to gain a solid understanding in Neural Networks, learning directly from one of the pioneers of Deep Learning. "
3503,Some mistakes in the materials and quizes make this course stronger that the others .
3504,Excellent content and overview of the field. Appreciated the links to journal papers as extensions to the lecture notes. Course is let down somewhat by lecture notes that skim the surface too much to really be useful and outright errors in quizzes and assignments that will hinder completion unless you read through every forum post to find the missing information. (Quiz 13 was the worst offender).
3505,This is an excellent course. Hats off to Prof Hinton. I had a great time learning new things. Thank you!
3506,Excellent course. Thanks to Prof Geoffrey Hinton for such a detailed course covering so many topics in this key field.
3507,"Great course, great teacher and great balance between theory and practise. Videos really need to understand the most difficult concepts"
3508,"Excellent material! Amazing to learn with one of the developers of NN.Unfortunately, there were lots of errors in the Quizzes and Assignments. Several questions could be answered only thanks to the help of other students that have had access to previous versions of the course.The mentors were at the beginning answering questions from the students that completed the course in the first couple of weeks and later disappeared. Then it was clearly in autopilot.Anyway, positive!It is necessary more hands on exercises to tight the theory with the practice. "
3509,"A great course to learn.Some quiz are broken, check forums often for that."
3510,"Hinton is the reason we use neural nets today. He's advanced the theory and continues to explore new approaches. This is eye opening. He motivates the theory behind each approach he advances very well. Unfortunately, the practical side of the pedagogy of this course is not as strong. It is understandable to not turn this into a programming class. However, there is too much of a gap between even a clear explanation of theory and actual practice. This could be remedied with more hands on exercises (not necessarily coding, though coding is a fine way to test understanding.)."
3511,Awesome course. Wish there were more programming assignments.
3512,"Sometimes it felt too fast paced, still I enjoyed it."
3513,Difficult but interesting course.
3514,I like this course because it not only explains the theory of neural computing but demonstrates neural networks ML with a lot of practical examples as well. It enlightened me in the applications of Machine Learning technologies. 
3515,It's one of the most well structured and prepared Coursera courses I've ever attended. The instructor Professor Hinton is also one of the most famous Deep Neural Network scholars nowadays. 
3516,Simply: illuminating.
3517,interesting history of neural networks and excellent coverage of all main architectures.couple of problems during the quizzes. An update is needed!
3518,"Course content:The material is very cool, a lot of topics are covered. As for me, sometimes it was hard to understand the material because there weren't enough visualization and animation. Would be good to visualize/animate content more, like in Andrew's Ng ML course (less text, more visualization).Organization:Some links were broken, some quizzes/assignments were without files/pictures, so it is bad."
3519,"The course is a bit disorganized and could have been better. While the topics are really interesting and Geoffrey is really knowledgeable, a lot of simple concepts have been made seemly complicated from the way they have been presented -- often requiring external follow up studies (and often discovering in surprise how simple they actually are). such as, contrastive divergence (CD1) algorithm to train Restricted Bolazamann Machine (read wikipedia to get it in under 2 mins), functioning of sigmoid belief net etc. I believe, the issue arises from slides based teaching, where a slide of texts is presented and then there is a long monologue of how that system works from start to end. A more useful approach would have been to actually draw-and-talk (good example of such courses are Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Game Theory (esp. Kevin Leyton-Brown parts). Nonetheless, the course brings forth a lot of Neural Net topics and is definitely worth taking if you are willing to study outside the course also."
3520,Really great and interesting course.
3521,"It is complete and interesting overview of state of neural network today. I really enjoyed lectures and quizes. Unfortunately, there are a couple bugs in coursera quizzes that confused me. Yet, forum discussions helped pass the course."
3522,"Great course for learning Neural Networks. I learnt from the best, the God-Father of Neural Networks. Who you learn from is just as important as what you learn."
3523,Excellent course but need do a some research outside of the course to understand it
3524,Great material
3525,A perfect introduction into the topic
3526,"The course is really good with a lot of intuition and technical details. The assignments and quizzes help clarify concepts and ideas. However the course requires a strong background in Mathematics and Statistics, so it may not be a course for people without such background.In addition, since the course has been out there for a few years, not many people joined my session and only a handful of people participated in the discussion forum. The forum has been quiet and not much help can be sought from the forum."
3527,"good , theoretical,but no new neural network technology . but ,if you understand the theoretical content , you will have one steady base to understand other new technology."
3528,"Programming exercises could be made more clear. Also, prior to each lecture, it would be useful to mention what specific papers or back ground material should be read to follow the lectures easily."
3529,"Definitely not an introductory course to machine learning, but even if you know nothing about the matter (like me) and have a fairly good understanding of mathematics, or are willing to use your spare time to catch up with linear algebra and calculus topics (again, like myself), you can still enjoy this course very much."
3530,"This was a superb course. I completely enjoyed it. There were a few technical issues with the assignments. But other than that, it was a top notch course."
3531,Prof. Hinton has an interesting viewpoint on machine learning models other than neural networks. Watch videos in the later weeks.
3532,"There are some problems of the organization of the course. Some conditions and some images are missing in quizzes. Even some videos are missing. There's no official response in the forum. Thanks to the responses of other students in the forum, i can finally do some of the quizzes. It's really frustrating. "
3533,"In general, this course goes through some basic aspects of neural networks, which is suited for beginners. However, some parts of the course are not clearly explained, e.g. the sigmoid belief net, and there's some problems with the quizes."
3534,Great course for an introduction to neural networks.
3535,Very interesting material covered and in-depth views. Unfortunately a few technical issues in quizzes.
3536,Very good course
3537,"The course was ported to the new Coursera platform in a amateurish way without any testing. Learners have been complaining on the forums for months about bugs and missing information in the assessments, and they are still not fixed. The content is generally interesting, but not presented in a cohesive way. Many concepts are juggled with without giving clear, mathematical definitions."
3538,"This is very advanced course I have to say. As many people have already mentioned, it's very hard to learn. Quite often I feel frustrated, helpless and feel like banging my head against the wall. But if you quit complaining and trying to work it out by poking around the forum and goolging a bit, often you will understand and agree what the professor said. I think it's because it's such an advanced topic that you can't cover the depth and breadth in such a short course (yes, I know it's 16-week!). To compare it with Andrew Ng's ML course, After finishing the latter, I have much confidence and interest in ML. But after finishing this course, I feel I know so little and have greater respect for those who's already in this field. That's a good thing I think coz you don't have illusion that you master something but in actuality you don't. Both courses are great and give me valuable things. Andrew's Ng course prepares points me to the right direction and give me motivation while Professor Hinton's course prepares me with the mentality that the process will not be easy but very rewarding."
3539,"Really great course. A couple of issues with missing lectures and problems with quizzes, but the quality and death of the content more than makes up for it. Fascinating and inspiring."
3540,"I found the course rather difficult, with respect to the other courses I did on Coursera. In my opinion part of the reason I found it difficult is that the material is not explained very well. Hinton is certainly a guru in Machine Learning, but I found him a bit boring as a teacher and often I thought he was explaining some details but failing to give the broader picture. I must admit I did not read the extra material provided with the course (the long articles) but only focused on the videos, slides and tests, perhaps had I read the articles I would have struggled less. I also did the course in 9 weeks instead of 16, but I did watch most videos twice so I feel I did dedicate some time to it. I much preferred Andrew Ng's course, and I strongly recommend doing that one first. I am also loving the University of Washington's Machine Learning specialization, but since I have been wating for the next course in that specialization for a while, I did Hinton's course in the mean time. That said, I did find this course useful, although I often felt somewhat frustrated."
3541,"Very inteligent course and quizesHowever, there are a few bugs in the grading system, check the relevant forums if your answers are wrongly indicated as mistakes"
3542,"Informative. I spent way more time on the programming assignments than the posted estimate. There was an error in the text for Programming Assignment 4 that was really frustrating; but luckily, someone had found the correct way to do it and had posted it on the forum. The intuition explanations during the lectures were great. All-around great course."
3543,"It is easy to brute force answers, which means, that those, who know it don't consider its certificate seriously and this reduces the importance of the certificate"
3544,"The content of this course is not self-contained. You need to search and read extra materials to fill some knowledge gaps. Besides, some of the videos are missing and some quiz are not well clarified. Well, given all the complaints, the instructor is of no doubt one of the best in this field. The topics in this course is worth exploring using your own time."
3545,"extremely well done ! highly recommend it ! The professor, the method and the content are incredibly good."
3546,"Absolutely loved this course. Warning: it's not really aimed at beginners. You probably want to do Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course first, play around with the ideas a bit, and then have a go at this one. In terms of style, this course feels a bit like a 'research level' course at a university. That is, the lectures cover a lot of material, at quite a high level. To get the most out of it, you're going to have to sit down after the course and spend some time coding up the ideas. Though I think that's a bonus.In terms of presentation, I thought the lectures were pretty clear and engaging. The course is originally from 2012, and covers material that was cutting edge at the time - including results that were still unpublished. I'd love to see an updated version of this course."
3547,Help me a lot in understanding some difficult concepts.
3548,"It is a great privilege to learn neural networks by Prof. Hinton, a giant in the field of neural networks, and I am grateful for that. This course is excellent as a broad introduction to neural networks. Prof. Hinton conveys a lot of intuition and technical details, and for people like me, who has no experience in neural networks sometimes it is difficult to see the forest for the trees. "
3549,"This course is good, unique and relevant for machine learning today. Some things can be improved though. Starting around weeks 11-12 the lectures become a bit vague, and I had quite some difficulty understanding them. It seemed to me that these lectures were hastily created (even though I can only imagine how much work creating this course must have been). Furthermore, the lab sessions are rather easy and the provided code is annoying to work with systematically since they output results as printed text instead of something re-usable. This makes experimentation (like grid searches) a bit tedious. Besides these minor things, the course is quite good.Note that deep learning topics are only briefly touched, but you won't obtain the skills for training and designing them yourself without further exploration of the topics.Finally, many thanks to the teachers!"
3550,Great course with awesome theory. The quizzes are great and help to re-inforce the conceptsImprovement area is availabililty of exercises in R &amp; Python and more programming assignments. Only 2 programming assignments are a shame
3551,"Really liked the course. The concepts were explained thoroughly, and I think I can apply some of the things I learned directly. Only downside was, that it is using Octave ."
3552,"Thank you for the great course. Going in, I thought all NNs were feed-forward so this really expanded my view and understanding. Minor issues with test mechanics but those were a small distraction."
3553,"This is a really deep dive into neural networks. It is highly theoretical, and includes deep details, and some optional deep mathematics in the subject. Hence, I do not consider this course as an introduction course on neural networks. I will not recommend this course to anyone who is just started learning about neural networks. However I do indeed recommend this course to anyone who would love to have a deep understanding of neural networks, and already has the basic understanding of neural networks and RBMs. If you've never used a neural network, never heard of backpropagation, or never got the basic understanding of RBMs, then this is not the course for you. If you a passionate about neural networks, have used them earlier, and what to get a deep understanding, this is indeed the course for you. I consider this a Ph.D level course. Thank you Professor Hinton for sharing some of your deep knowledge to the Coursera community."
3554,"Should have a bigger practical component. Also, there are a lot of technical problems with the course."
3555,"Great, moderately advanced material, that will boost your knowledge on neural nets."
3556,"There are few typos and missing videos in the archive, but overall this is a top level quality course. It's not an easy one, can be a good follow-up course after professor Andrew Ng's machine learning course."
3557,"Quizzes were buggy, but the lectures were good"
3558,"I really like this course. Geoffrey Hinton is one of the very best researchers in Neural Networks in the world. I gave it 4 stars (instead of 5) for substandard implementation of its tests (misaligned questions and missing question content) and programming exercises (missing supporting documentation and code). I was able to get through this problems by googling it, but this was frustrating. Once this problems are sorted out, this course will be really enjoyable. "
3559,"This course provides a great foundation to build upon, but it is not very engaging. The instructor is simply reading off the screen and it looks like all the lectures were recorded over one day. He struggles to read the material towards the end of the course, while often mispronouncing the words and neglecting the concept of punctuation. I would recommend reading the reference book used in this course, Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know, because listening to the lectures is painful!"
3560,"It's a great course, I've learned a lot. "
3561,This course is informative and deals with the subject on a basic level so that we can use these lessons to understand and study further.
3562,"Hello, I found difficult to understand the speakers and it was too massive."
3563,"A very interesting and comprehensive basic course on cyber warfare and cyber conflict and how they are will impact our lives in the future. The course provides a good view of cyber threats related to the political, economic, diplomatic realms of nowadays international relations."
3564,"Much of the literature was unavailable which I think is a downside. Also, while interesting, the topics were covered only superficially and I felt that that questions during the videos and at the end of the module were very easy and did not challenge the participant to think or research."
3565,Fantastic course.
3566,"good insight on fundamentals on cyber conflicts, for b"
3567,nice course. however would have liked more specific examples of cyber conflicts along with how they were resolved to each country's satisfaction ( if there are any such examples to look at ). Thank you to you all for putting this course together.
3568,"It's Ok, nothing much to gain iin terms of knowledge realted to cyber conflict."
3569,Great Couse!
3570,The course was alright
3571,Excellent materials and professors!!!
3572,"I like the comparisons between past physical wars and current cyberwar. However, the course take the long way to explain very basic elements of nations interactions and trust."
3573,"The videos were not always easy to understand because of the unclear pronouncing of the key speaker. Also although most of the tests were easy to complete, the ones that you had to write the answer down instead of only choosing the correct answer, were hard since if one word you wrote was wrong you lost the question. "
3574,"The course in very interesting. It is focused on Cyber threats, cyber crime, Actors of Cyber crime, Motivation, attributions, psychology, international situation, cyber attacks in history, confidence building measures.I learnt a lot from the course and I highly recommend the course to others."
3575,It gives you an interesting visions about hot subjects and provides with sources to go deeper. Maybe a course to short on each topic covered.
3576,"Pretty good course. While the assessments are pretty much just a repeat of the in-video questions, I feel I was still able to learn a fair amount. "
3577,Its indeed a plus to my career growth...
3578,A detailed course which will give a great insight
3579,"Excellent Course, if you want to clear your aspect over International Cyber Conflicts."
3580,I enjoyed the course and it ticked the boxes of my expectation.
3581,A Great Course to understand the Cyber Conflicts issue. Highly recommend to individuals learning Cyber security or planning to go in that direction. Thank you to the Course Team for making the material easy to understand and interactive lessons !!
3582,Excellent.
3583,"This course - analyses the Cyberworld - and what it is there for the people of the world. Very well compiled syllabus, course contents and assigment/quizzes. Thanks to the Professors of State University of NewYork as well as Coursera."
3584,solid course
3585,A political view of the Cyber Conflicts.
3586,"Nice blend of psychology, game theory, international relations and cyberwarfare, enriched with all kind of examples from the nuclear arms race."

3599,"I thought SPECTACULAR HOW PROVIDING CLASSES, making THOSE WHO LIVE IN OTHER COUNTRIES, SITUATIONS AND POWER NOTE PROVIDING SUCH INFORMATION ABOUT ONE OR OTHERWISE COMMUNICATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. "
3600,Good course ... good introduction to the topic.
3601,"The lectures are very well-organized. The topics are also cover in this field. However, the lectures are very dry and boring. The main professor were reading the scripts on the monitor. From my perspective, with his knowledge in this field as being described on his personal web site, he should be able to talk comfortably by looking at the topic on the slide then discuss about it in detail. I would suggest to change the environment to be at the wide open space, like coffee shop, to make this course more attractive. I'm sorry, it is not what I expected."
3602,Superb course. Gave me a lot of insights.
3603,"Course in not only just about theory of cyber security .But also ,It also accommodates psychological view to cyber world . This makes it more interesting .The brief part of law related to cyber security buttress the content maturity .However, More information on privacy should be added .If done ,course is a 5 star Course .Moreover, every lecture gives information.So, efficiently crafted out of course .Overall,it's worth taking and worth time spending"
3604,"A little bit short, but a great introductory class. Won't go into too much detail, but will get you started on the subject."
3605,"Excellent course, video lectures were very useful, psychology portion was especially interesting."
3606,Professors accent very hard to understand. Week 5's lesson should be reviewed as may have no place in class 
3607,"Parts are thin on detail. This is a good and broad overview but lacks in-depth information of use to cyber security specialists. Still, a good course to start with if you plan to move forward."
3608,"The topic of the course is very interesting, the readings were important, but some of the reading were based on a book, that I had to purchase. Was a very useful course, but was a little bit tiring, videos with 12 minutes with too much theory but less pratical examples. But was a good experience. I would like to thanks the professors, that made this course."
3609,Good for an international perspective on Cyber Conflicts. Covers a wide range of topics
3610,Wished the course was a deeper dive into this area.
3611,The course content was great but delivery was a little dry. Appears that the presenters were reading from a teleprompter - sort of awkward.
3612,This course was very informative and helped me understand about International Cyber Conflicts. Ahmad.
3613,The same information was covered in multiple lessons. It was a very conceptual look at cyber conflicts that you could get if you paid attention to the news over the last five years. 
3614,"I'm sorry that I'm going to sound harsh, but this course is useless.It touches so many different topics without going deeply into any of them. All you get is a basic knowledge about All Things Cyber???.The recommended readings are all over the place, the video captions look like they're just a basic speech recognition and like nobody actually proof read them. They're full of errors. Lecturers say one word, captions show a completely different word. Plus, they're full of spelling errors. (Kadafi regime in Libya!? Really!?)You can get the same amount of knowledge by reading two or three Wikipedia pages. Don't waste your time on this course."
3615,"Course was ok. However, some of questions were not clear based on excerpt from support video. For example, quiz #1 question 7. Course was general overview of very important subject matter of Cyber Conflicts. Looking forward to a more specific and detailed course structure. PS: A course concerning Cyberwar in Space would be quite interesting."
3616,A comprehensive course with good thematic.
3617,very relevant
3618,Good material. 
3619,Very useful course!
3620,+ Excellent introduction and overview. Recommend!-Some of the readings were not available on the internet
3621,"Having no experience in cyber security, this course is helping me understand the basics of cyber security so that I may advance in Cyber forensics. I highly recommend it."
3622,"This course is very interesting and actualized. My unique problem is about the certificate, I need information about the quantity of hours duration."
3623,Great information on cyber conflicts and the psychology of cyber conflict and warfare. 
3624, it was interesting to learn about the dynamics of the Internet and how it is used for villainous purposes.
3625,"This was a very good course (4.5/5.0). One area that could be improved would be the discussion of industrial control systems (ICS). On lecture briefly mentions STUXNET and SCADA, but this was rather incomplete discussion. A very recent incident that could have been used was the attack on the Ukraine Power grid as a demo of a cyber attack against infrastructure. https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/IR-ALERT-H-16-056-01?_mc=sm_dr_editor_kellyjacksonhigginsI am perhaps biased toward this area, since this is my field of work. "
3626,"Excellent instructors, very interesting subject and great learning experience. Highly recommended Course for those aiming to master this subject."
3627,awesome course I learned a great 
3628,"On the positive side I emphasise the importance of bringing this topic to a Coursera course. Also the readings were important and added value to the learning experience.On the other hand there are - in my opinion some aspects that made this course a not so rich experience. First, there are some audio issues in the videos. Second, the quizzes are excessively easy and the in video quizzes should not appear in the weekly assignments. If there are required readings, some of the quiz questions should relate to those readings. This way students had an incentive to go over those readings. But the most salient thing that made my experience very limited was the fact that one of the instructors - the one that presented most of the videos, was excessively nervous and all that he did was read the slides, in most cases not doing so naturally and committing errors, rephrasing, stopping, changing speed. I found it very, very difficult to follow along what he was saying. I had to focus only on the slides, otherwise I would get distracted. I think it is ok to be nervous or at ease, but the team should alerted him to this, and shoot the videos again and again until they had acceptable and balanced quality. A minor thing, I would like to had available the weekly slides to further reflection. I think the video issues that I've mentioned should been carefully planned before this course made it mainstream.This is my opinion. Hope it will help you for future improvements of the course and/or other offerings.Ricardo Oliveira"

The interaction between the teacher and the slides is limited to a reading exercise that does not provide any add value at all. Very dissapointed and still wondering if this course is worth my attention -and extremely limited time- or not. Plenty of room for improvement."
3694,"I have sat through 4 of the lessons and I am not very impressed. I fell that the topic is very interesting, but the professor does not do a very good job explaining the algorithms. It may be because I do no have the textbook, but overall a rather poor course. There need to be a little more explanation beyond the slides."

3706,Great course! 
3707,"Excellent course.Gives you a hands-on approach to Angular JS, with links to more resources so that you can explore further and find all information you need to build a complete project."
3708,Tough but worth it
3709,There are no better ways than this! It's a great course and i would really recommend it for anyone because i gained more experience i never grasp before doing AngularJs course from another source and find the technique in this course more easier to understand too. 
3710,Tough and fast paced. It requires a lot troubleshooting. This is one of those classes where it hurts so good.
3711,great class. assignment 4 is a killer. make sure you really learn things in first assignments instead of just copy and paste.
3712,very good course
3713,really great course with awesome professor
3714,Highly recommended course. Helped a lot to get deeper understanding and later translate the knowledge to knew projects. Some topics you might need to watch more than one time.
3715,"A tough course, requires consistent hard work!!!!"
3716,Practical and interesting.
3717,Very general but complete guide to get started on integrating some patterns and practices to deliver responsive web apps with open source tools
3718,Great Course! 
3719,Great course! I just had some little problems with some explanations but it was just once. Thank you very much Coursera and University of Hong Kong and proffesors :)
3720,Excelente curso
3721,"Great course. It is great for learning Angular1. we can learned with angular term services, controller, model, templates, dependency injection, filter.. Great for angular basic and we develop project along course."
3722,"At first I didn't know the value of this course. Every one just criticized me by saying that this is a time waste and need to concentrate more on back-end. But, now a days everyone is moving towards angularJs and updating their frameworks using Angular. Now, people who blamed me, were coming to me and saying that I was lucky knowing about this. Now, I knew the value about this. Thanks for the course !"
3723,Very Good
3724, Excellent instructor with a sense of humor. Nicely organized course. You'll learn - if you're willing to. Invest more time than suggested. -- Iftekhar Ahmad Chowdhury
3725,Great course!
3726,Great Learning
3727, Excelente 
3728,"Great course, great materials, great technology."
3729,"Thanks all for this greate course, I want to give special thank to our teacher Mr Jogesh K. Muppala."
3730,great class.
3731,"This was very difficult course for me (as for newbie). But at the same time it broadened my horizons. AngularJS - very interesting course. I'm glad to become graduate. Special thanks to professor Jogesh K. Muppala for his intelligence, kindness and excellent sense of humour. Also thanks to all people, who made a major contribution to this course: record videos, write subtitles, correct code, consulting as mentors. So I wish prosperity to this course and lots of success!"
3732,This course is well designed with very good coverage of technical details of various aspects of web development. The exercises and assignments are quite inspiring. I would strongly recommend this course to those want to learn wen development and don't have much experience yet. 
3733,little bit slow but very good. some extra tools added that make it slow and boring but it makes it very interesting if we understand its benefit 
3734,Nicely designed course to learn AngularJS
3735,"Covers all the essential topics. At the end of the course, one should have enough confidence to try and deploy pages on their own. The topics are well explained and the teacher keeps the listener engaged with his teaching style."
3736,Course is very compact and informative
3737,"Lots of random details that the professor seems to have missed make the course difficult because you end up spending hours debugging random, irrelevant things."
3738,Very well explained from basics
3739,"The practical approach of taking a problem and solving it throughout the course and in the process teach stuff is super awesome. You get introduced to a concept and immediately followed by implementing it in the product at hand and thereby improving the product. When you actually do the exercises you get a satisfaction of developing a product along the way, which is very nice.If I ever plan to teach, this is the approach I'll be taking.PS: The sprinkle of humor is refreshing breaks from serious listening otherwise! Thanks for that too."
3740,It is a awesome course
3741,Great course to be introduced in AngularJS and learn the basic functionality of this framework.
3742,"Should be a more in depth course.Although for an introduction into AngularJS, it is a very good course."
3743,"Thank you for these lessons, answered my pressing questions about web development"
3744,I've been trying to learn Angular for so long! This course finally demystified the basics for me.
3745,"good and useful course, but includes some content (unit testing) that is extraneous and could be in a separate course"
3746,Awesome course
3747,Its great!
3748,Overall course arrangement is awsome
3749,Excelent course
3750,good
3751,"During this course I had many issues with bower and version conflicts. I do everything step by step like in the video, and nothing works. I look at error log and realize there is some issue with versions. =\ It would be really nice if you explained how to deal with it, instead of making me waste hours of my time on googling this stuff. It almost made me quit using bower forever. "
3752,Wonderful course to learn AngularJS. Thank you to Jogesh K Muppala for explaining in a each and every topic and excercises more practically.
3753,"Apart from angular i learn task runners, testings, scaffolds and more. Love this one!"
3754,"This is excellent training for the person who likes to keep up with the latest and greatest front-end developments. If you don't like to switch up and turn on a dime then this course is not for you. I had trouble aplenty and yet the point seemed to be: stay flexible, be prepared to use obscure tools (that are supposed to make the site work better but who knows exactly what is happening under the hood), expect change and adversity, become an expert at debugging that crappy code and refactoring everything at the drop of a hat. This is probably good approximation of real world experience where you would need to come in on a project and bail them out of angularjs damnation. Be prepared to be frustrated."
3755,It was a challenging and a fun course. Good in-depth and hands on experience on Angular and other web-tools.
3756,Excelent!
3757,"Very nice course! You should include an explanation of the versions of the angular components that are compatible, it could be very releasing."
3758,Excellent course!
3759,"some difficult, but it's so useful and powerful languages"
3760,Perfect course to get started with AngularJS
3761,Great course to learn about AngularJS. Syllabus is good to provide step by step and deep learning. Examples are good to provide practice practices with steps. Assignment is also a good test for the knowledge learned in each week. 
3762,Excellent course
3763,Great course.
3764,I did not know what was going on and I have to stop.
3765,Must for a new age programmer
3766,Great!
3767,amazing course gave me in-depth knowledge of Angular.js framework!
3768,comprehensive 
3769, This is a Great Course. However I think that is a wonderful option to have an intermediate leve with angularJs. 
3770,Should be updated with angular 2 components. Rest it was awesome
3771,good and useful course 
3772,excellent course i ever did 
3773,Bad video quality and errors in course material. Worst course on Coursera.
3774,"This was my first online course. I have everyday given 2 to 3.30hrs in this course. As angular.js is really in demand, I was eager to learn it and this course is good in terms of the lectures by prof. Muppala , materials and the exercises. Exercises are doable but let me say this to the would be en-rollers that if you miss a tiny winy thing between the scrips, you will have to devote a hell lotta time to fix it . The assignments are challenging and those gave me the feel that angular is not that easy peasy at all. Submitting the assignments on time is suggestible as late submission can create a mess to get required number of reviews on time. I have submitted two assignments after deadline and had to request a lot of classmates to review my submission. Prof Muppala is one great teacher. He is good at explaining stuffs so easily which are actually not that easy. Overall it was a good experience. I am looking forward to what this skill will offer me in my career ahead and also looking forward to learn more from coursera. "
3775,"The lessons were well structured and easy to follow, while covering all of the essential topics needed to use Angular, including some server-side development tools. As an introductory course, it met my expectations."
3776,"I can't even begin to describe how much pain this course gave me.The code snippets and instructions in the exercise videos are incomplete/have errors and it's impossible to complete the exercises just using those (it's hours of extra work to get things working). Also, at some point you are given a new version of part of the files in the project, which won't match the rest of the files so there's remedial work to be done for that too. Some of these issues were flagged on the forum 5 months ago and still the course material wasn't updated. It all gets even worse as all assignments build upon the code written in these exercises.The assignment instructions are unclear. You are shown a demo of how the solution should look in the assignment videos, and then you are told you actually have to build something different than what you were shown. I also couldn't understand some of the grading criteria. You will get/lose marks on uploading a screenshot or naming variables/functions a certain way.I was really interested in this specialization so I kept going hoping it will get better but it only got worse. After 11 weeks of work I am ready to start something different. Wasn't expecting such low quality content on Coursera."
3777,Very in depth and practical course that gets you jump-started on AngularJS. The quizzes were a bit too simple but I imagine the assignments would have more content (since they are locked behind purchase). Would love to see a Angular 2 course as well.
3778,We need Angular 2
3779,Nice Description with good exercises.Please provide a course for Angular 2 also
3780,Awesome course for a good startup!!!
3781,"Very Good Course to learn. Assignments are very good,"
3782,very satisfied 
3783,"this course overall is great. the content needs to be more in depth and give more compact information in each session. also need to give more detail why we should do certain step instead of just tell how to do. the course offer resources, and this aids with further self-pace learning, which is helpful. the ppt resource could cover more content in detail.overall it is a good course."
3784,superb course
3785,Best Ever!
3786,Superb course
3787,love it
3788,The most complete course for angular beginners. Grat job teacjer Mupala =D
3789,good. its a worth your time
3790,good
3791,Excellent break down of Angular JS. A very good introduction; you will still need to read the Angular JS docs to get depth.
3792,"This course was too messy. I spent 75% of my time to get the examples to work. It would have been better if after each module all the .js and .html files would be given in total, not just the snippets."
3793,Great Course. Have a wide knowledge about Angular js.
3794,Amazing instructor!
3795,Very nice course! Huge amount of things to learn and very useful to work on the web app field! Thanks
3796,"Explicit design of course, easy to understand flow and good practice assignments"
3797,Very Good course. Recommended
3798,It was a great course
3799,this course is good . thank you for this information .we look forward more
3800,"The course was really demanding for me but in the end you feel like you achieved something. Don't give up if your localhosts don't work, there are solutions, look it up."
3801,"Good introductory type course but when there are issues a student is having that no other peer can resolve, the instructors are almost NEVER available to assist."
3802,Really useful and informative!
3803,"Overall pretty good, but I think maybe the course ought to be extended a week or so to really take time and look at descriptions of the tasks run in the task runners. The angular content is pretty good and helpful, though. "
3804,Great
3805,"Should update to Angular 2, or at least revise some exercises to include code for Angular 1.6.. and keep track properly of when gulpfile should be updated!"
3806," Starting from fundamental concepts to basic practice, Professor Muppala has the way to make you learn better. "
3807,Great course. AngularJS is presented gradually with good manners. Super work by Jogesh K. Muppala.
3808,A well presented course with broad coverage of AngularJS. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The Coursera platform is excellent and easy to use.
3809,Good content and awesome instructor :)
3810,sir you are best .. i learnt so much from you and i really appreciatie your work for students
3811,Good Course Learned much from it
3812,"Exercise sources are not up to date, I have come across many problems."
3813, Excellent! First time in Angular ; it was a very good course. 
3814,perfect
3815,The course is well structured. 
3816,Amazing course. Thank you Yakov.
3817,One of the best course in coursera. Thanks!
3818,Great! I have really learned a lot by attending this course. Hope to see the AngularJS 2 or React course anytime soon :)
3819," Amazing Course, made me understand Angular in an easy way. It gave me a good quick start. Hats of to the teacher for all the hard work."
3820,it was fun ...
3821,Very easy to understand.E
3822,Great Course
3823,Excellent 
3824,Thanks to Mr. Jogesh for carrying out complex concepts with ease. 
3825,Awesome course
3826,666
3827,very helpful for newbies
3828,"This course -- actually, both the 2nd and 3rd courses in this specialization -- are like take your interested, but mostly uninformed friend to work day. Give them some stacks of paper to sort, then shown them what a correctly sorted stack looks like. You've only got one day at work with your friend, so be kind enough to humor them with a very cursory explanation of what sorting is about, but you can't really teach them much in such a short time. So, set them to task, sorting pile after pile. Hey look! Your friend is now a practiced sorter!These courses are really for folks who can spend much more time than advertised. Sure, you will see lots of really cool things -- like AngularJS, Grunt, Bower, etc. -- but don't come into this believing that you'll really learn them, because that is just not possible with the time allowed. This whole thing is about exposure, not deep understanding. Want to learn the guitar? This is like going to watch a (very slow) concert, and then having the guitarist hand you their instrument, put your fingers on the correct frets, and then strum the strings for you. See -- now you can play!Thinking of learning algebra? How about if I simply told you to write the numeral 5, then the addition symbol, then the letter X, then the equals symbol, and finally the numeral 12, and then proceeded to tell you, step-by-step, what you should write on the page in order to solve for X. Would you have learned about solving equations? At most, you would have written a workable example for solving a certain kind of equation, but I doubt you'd be anywhere near proficient after being hand-held through one example.On the positive side, I was exposed to many different things in the web-development world -- that I cannot argue against. However, this course could be so much more. The model of having students watch a video of a person talking about coding, whether in front of a Power Point slide or a text editor full of code, is borrowing from the worst of the lecture-first classroom experience of (most of) higher ed. It's a bummer that we aren't moving in a different direction with this stuff after so long, but I guess it's still what people expect (or at least have learned to cope with). "
3829,Rushed though the core material. 
3830,Definitely Not for young new front end learners .Lots of things difficult to understand.
3831,Nice course getting into AngularJS programming foundations and some very useful tools.
3832,"Good course, cover most important topics in didatc way. But the code quality is poor and I advice to study the John Papa's Angula code style to learn a better way of using AngularJS."
3833,Easy to understand.
3834,"This great course will teach you not only how to create a single page application, but it will also show you the basics about developing to the web, as it shows you the tools that will allow you to work better as a web developer."
3835,This was a hard course and many of the exercises did not have enough details to complete the assignments on time. I had to rely on course forums and a lot of googling to finish the course successfully. 
3836,"Many errors appeared doing exercises, material needs to be updated - many node modules already deprecated. Also it'll be better if teacher more clarify all the actions he doing. Sometimes he did something not clear and there was no answer what is happening and why in this way."
3837,i got bunch of info in this course i believe i won't get it in organized and net way anywhere else. and i recomned even learn angular from anywhere else take the course. 
3838, The course was very clear and interesting! 
3839,Nice course. However I am hearing scratching noises when the tutor is speaking which is little disturbing.
3840,This course is not for javascript beginners. You should come in with solid understanding of the language - probably more than you would get from the first two courses of this program. 
3841,"A bit outdated now, however it is still a good resource to get started."
3842,recommended course covers all angular 1
3843,Thank you for providing new Angulagr js course 
3844,This course is very clear. The assignments were very well for improving my understanding.Thank you.
3845,Very useful course with excellent course material. However there were some problems with the audio quality. Fixing them would make this course really enjoyable.
3846,Not well designed and the professor hard to follow...
3847,Good :)
3848,Very fine explanation
3849,This class gives me a very useful knowledge that help me a lot in my work. The teacher's lecture is very suited with novice
3850,Nice!! I can write a web application now!
3851,good
3852,Thank you !
3853,nice course and nice explanation 
3854,Excellent source of information.
3855,"Angular is very extensive, difficult to understand, but the teacher finds the way putting together everything, Excellent course, the best until now. "
3856,Excellent course. I was very helpful!!
3857,very good
3858,This is the best course in getting the basic understanding of AngularJS. I really did get a lot out this course and I would highly recommend anyone for trying to learn angularJs. The organization and the layout of the course and also the professor explanation of the concept are really great!!
3859,Nice Course. Professor makes it more easy and interesting to learn. Thank You Sir.
3860,Too hard to listen his English
3861,very well structured for learning at our own space!
3862,I like the professor...but the activities and projects always had errors and issues that weren't easily fixable. And the mentors are absolutely terrible at providing guidance. So I most likely won't be able to finish this course.
3863,"AngularJS is The brain in the front-end development, and it was the most difficult part of this specialization so far, regarding all the concepts behind, like TDD, REST, MVC, etc. Once that you understand all of these concepts, the course is great. Professor Joggesh explains the angular features in a comprehensive way and his references to external links are a must."
3864,very interesting course
3865,Fantastic!!
3866,Super good start for people without any javascript experience. But you will need more in real life :)
3867,The teacher is amazing
3868,Nice Course 
3869,"I loved this coursed, it allowed me to get more opportunities in my work field, I highly recommend it."
3870,Learning materials are poorly delivered. Codes given are bug-ridden this in turn makes it incredibly difficult to follow on. Disappointing
3871,thx
3872, This course is the best part of the Full Stack series. I would like to see a more advance course just on Angular.
3873,"I liked this course so much. I never had used Angular JS nor JSON before and now I leanerd something new. Now, I'm going to put in practice all I've learned with my new projects. Thanks a lot to Jogesh K. Muppala and Coursera for the shared knowledges."
3874,"Very good course, go ahead"
3875,"it is good , but some items needs to be illustrated in more details , a great thing of this course is that it gives a lot of practice exercises "
3876,The tutor is exceptionally good. It included all the sources for documentation but I felt I learned more from by reading the Angularjs official documentation than from this course. Assignments covered a variety of concepts. 
3877,Great introduction to angular.js
3878,For a newbie in Frameworks I could learn a lot! Thanks to the professor and this excelent complete course.
3879,Quite a good experience.
3880,Very nice explanations!
3881,"Very complete course, good teacher on my first experience with coursera, really great ! "
3882,Cours complet et excellent autant pour les d??butants que ceux qui pratiquent d??j??. Tous les concepts de Angular 1.X sont visit??s 
3883,"Muito bom, pensando fazer a parte paga."
3884,The course was very helpful. I can now work comfortably with Angular. Thank you!
3885,"A nice overview on Angular JS, just enough to get you started!"
3886,There are steps that are missing at times which require you to scour for help. There are also quirks that aren't mentioned that other students have to point out. Unaddressed questions in the discussion board required escalation. Feels rushed and it's hard to learn for a beginner. Feels like you're just going through the motions and copy and pasting code.
3887,I am a bit disappointed by this course. I was expecting a more fast paced course with more information regarding Angular. Unfortunately in the videos there is a lot of time spent on unnecessary details and reading out loud the source code. The exercises are quite basic and they did not pose real challenges - except for errors coming from mismatched packages or mistakes in configuration files. Also I think that the level of support provided by the mentors of this course is lacking. Mentors are quite absent and very late in providing any help in the forums so the students have to kind of counsel one another - that is sometimes good but a proper class also requires a good level of supervision.All in all I think this is an OK course that is mostly geared to the uninitiated. It needs some serious work to make it a great course.
3888,"Professor just does not explain the concepts well, just reads the code snippets. You need to figure things out the hard way. You don't get too much help from the moderators as well."
3889,Amazing course!
3890,a great course and good instructor.
3891,"Great Course for angular 1.x for angular newbies.It includes almost all the angular basic concept,including module,controller,service,filter,directive,view,data model,expressions,two way binding,dependency injection.And also this course provides a good full example illustrating how to use angular CRUD app.However,finishing this course is far from being proficient in angular developing,you should keep practicing more and find more resources from angular official websites."
3892,"very informative and challenging course, i enjoyed finishing it."
3893,Challenging but fun!
3894,"It's a lot better than trying to learn the methods and information on my own without an instructor. I feel very empowered. In any case, the course was a very good brain workout."
3895,Teacher is really bad. Terrible.
3896,I definitely enjoyed doing this course. The exercises really helped me understand it and it makes you more involved. 
3897,Excellent course. Thanks.
3898,very useful course
3899,Best Course for Beginner
3900,Top interest!
3901,There are no advanced stuff these what is taught are basics any graduate or undergraduate student can easily pickup on his/ her own interest. What a waste of time . 
3902,Everything is clearly explained! Practice was great!
3903,Well i am surprised that Angularjs is not easy to learn but how easily and smartly you teach this course.. Really appreciated Sir!!
3904,excellent
3905,Loved it
3906,j'ai trouv?? le contenu tr??s enrichissant et utile.
3907,Superb Course!!!!
3908,A wonderful course! Good theory with coll practices!
3909,It help me a lot. thanks
3910,very nice and helpful
3911,This course is awesome!! it is very informative and you learn a lot as a beginner. I love the blooper alert. 
3912,"good course, very informative "
3913,"This course will help you to fall in love with AngularJS. Great explanation and exercise, assignments. Thank you very much."
3914,Wonderful course! Love it and learn a lot!
3915,clear and the examples are very useful!
3916,nice course and sequenced well.
3917,"The Course is an extensive coverage of various in-depth resources of technologies and concepts related to AngularJS. I really like the course and the mentor, who is taking great pain in making us understand the jargons behind the course. Thank You Sir for your invaluable insight. "
3918,easy to learn.
3919,"For all the many courses I took on Coursera, this course is one of the best. "
3920,The course was just fine. Some of the lectures were really good while some lectures were really confusing. The good thing is that course provides excellent resources for further exploring the topics in the course. So i had to consult these additional resources when i find lectures confusing.Course Assignments were really simple. Hardly any assignment took me more than an hour to complete. 
3921,"It was informative course. Assignments could be more involved, and exercises could be more open-ended. "
3922,"Examples are clear, very good introductory course. Can using w3schoool as reference"
3923,This course teach me one important thing : That is my job in the future.
3924,Perfect and comprehensive course..thank you very much.
3925,I recommend this course for naive to medium level expertise.
3926,I like this course for some reasons: - a lot of understandable theory; - good practical tasks; - understandable and detailed speech of teacher.
3927,Helpful
3928,Good.
3929,Good quality content and great instructor. I recommend it!It does not cover though a very important feature from angular: directives. 
3930,Quite helpful
3931,Very complex and interesting module.
3932,This course is a real workout! 
3933,Great course!
3934,Great! 
3935,"Overall the course is very good but it gets trickier the further you go, specially if you have no experience in this area whatsoever... Take it from someone who's first contact with Web Development was the first course in this Specialization: HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript. My advice to students in a similar situation is to look for other sources of information as well and try to experiment with your code as the lessons go by so you can really grasp the meaning of the pieces of code you're writing. Eventually, they'll start to make sense :-)"
3936,"Excelente, hoy en d??a es de gran utilidad saber Angular JS ya que se est?? convirtiendo en un standar para el uso de la programaci??n en Javascript."
3937,"Extremely poor help and feedback. Almost no replies on discussion forums from mentors/peers so many issues end up unresolved. Considering how difficult this course is compared to other courses, the lack of real assistance is appalling. Seemingly outdated lessons. A lot of errors I get come from version discrepancies. Lessons should be checked over. If I have to Google problems to complete step-by-step lessons, the lesson is extremely ill-prepared. This is enough to make me abort this specialization. "
3938,Its very challenging for me... 
3939,This course is awesome!!!!! Thanks 
3940,"This is wonderful!Thank you, Mr. Muppala."
3941,very good course to help me start with angular and javascript frame work learning!
3942,"Best full stack courses, even after this single course you can separately make a powerful front end"
3943,"A great course on Angular JS, explained in an excellent practical manner. Exercise videos clearly show and allow us to practice along which makes the understanding very effective."
3944,La verdad este curso es de lo mejor te da las herramientas para que puedas desarrollar con angular recomendado
3945,Good Course
3946,Best course ever!
3947,Excelent Course!! Very recomended!
3948,Good one.Like the Bloomers at the end of some videos.
3949,Good.
3950,excellent
3951,A good course for Angular JS.
3952,Awesome course!
3953,Fantastic. Very glad to have taken this course.
3954,Very bad explanation too boring lectures
3955,Complete
3956,excellent course
3957,Excellent education!
3958,good course
3959,sometimes it's hard to get things.. .. but it's very useful and strong course
3960,"This course is excellent, highly recommended"
3961,Had good content but description was a like scattered manner. It could have better if explanation should be in fluent manner.
3962,"Very good course, with much to learn. By applying step by step every aspect of the course was for me very helpful. I hope more and more courses to follow this example."
3963,Great Course for those who wants to go deeper in Front-End Frameworks
3964,Good
3965,This course needs an easier way to peer review. Downloading individual files to computer and plugging into your project without overwriting your own work is a nuisance. Especially during assignment 4 where everything needed to be hosted in the server in order to work; this made is extremely difficult to review. 
3966,"Great Content, and by the end of the course you have a full fledged Front-end website working."
3967,Great course! 
3968,Wonderful experience (y)Must try!!
3969,"Fantastic course, fantastic teacher."
3970,"Easy to understand, but hard to listen. I think we need a American teacher"
3971,Cannot believe charge me homework
3972,Great
3973, Excelent! 
3974,so far excellent. After first week.
3975,Everything is explained in a big rush. Very hard to get starting from the second week
3976,thank you professor
3977,Excellent
3978,"not good as usual one, the code you provided can not work, I had to debug againand the instructions for the assignments are not concrete as the last two courses"
3979,"A massive amount of content to cover, some of it quite advanced. The exercises become fraught if your code is out of sync with the tutor's code. Things won't work, you won't know why, and there's no real recovery from that. "
3980,I didnt know anything about Angular. Now I feel confident with the skills learned. Great instructor. Funny
3981,no basics being taught! straight away code snippets are pasted.
3982,This course was really helpful in understanding the basic functionalities in angular js.Looking forward to learning more in the next few days
3983,great course
3984,Enjoyed the course. It really increased my skills
3985,"Very nice course, but it would be even better if it was about Angular 2, since it is to become the standard AngularJS is/was."
3986,Good course
3987,"Excellent course on Front-End JavaScript Frameworks. Covers a wide range of web development topics and tools that can easily overwhelm first-time takers. Professor Jogesh is a great instructor who knows his stuff and explains everything thoroughly. Students may have to take this class twice to really soak in the material, and this is just the front-end side of web development! "
3988,Very good
3989,"also, good course but not free to access the assignment"
3990,"That course is very useful to became a Fullstack Web developer. Of course, a lot of work to be done but in the end - a full respect of yourself and ..a sigh of relief (by Professor J.Muppala) :-D"
3991,"A whole lot of information to absorb, that I will definitely agree with! If there was anything I wish went into more detail, there would be two things.1) Yo / Yeoman: This part of the course was more of an Obligatory lecture, just to say it's mentioned. I watched that one video many times over, but still ended up going to YouTube for actual training on the ins and outs. I know time is constrained in MOOC's and you don't get the full load of knowledge you would in a traditional school. However, my thoughts are that either give us an exercise so we can at least have that as experience in using it, or just remove it completely. The lecture was put together as a sort of Follow Along, but it really felt rushed and more of an Obligatory thing than an actual lesson.2) Give us more detail on the difference between Services and Factories. Keep in mind that I still have Multi-Platform Mobile App Development, and Server Side Development with Node.js still to go, so I don't know if these are explained more in those courses. As it stands right now, I -still- don't know the difference between a factory and a service, or even what a provider is. When should I use a factory? When should I use a service? Which is better suited for what task? All those questions I do not have an answer for after this course, which feels a bit short for me. "
3992,"Angular JS is a crucial component of all of the internet. Hardly a website exists without it and it's clear that Angular will go places. However, this course fails on a few crucial levels. As such, my review might look scathing and I'll detail why in a minute, but I want you to know that this course is quite possibly invaluable when it comes to web development. Besides, the fixes that would need to be made on the instructor's side are minor, but when working without those fixes, things get infuriatingly frustrating rather quickly.There are errors in the code supplied by the instructor that need to be pointed out by students, scripts sometimes don't work, explanations are sub-par when explaining things such as $scope. There are parts that are seemingly there to pad out the lessons such as Task Runners. Sometimes, doing things exactly the way shown in the video with additional fixes by both the professor and students, it still doesn't work. Some exercises are an hour long for something that won't be quizzed in the end.Understanding that this review was made about a new course that covers something rapidly changing and not persistent, I still did learn a lot of valuable things and I would recommend this course to everyone involved in web development. However, be prepared to question your own sanity, your skills, the software you use, software in general and just despair at times. All in all, it is a price worth paying for the amazing knowledge you gain."
3993,"Amazing Course , i recommend it !"
3994,very good course
3995,"Very Nice Course. Takes us through everything and enables us with basic promised objective. Good Luck to Course creators, keep adding more to it."
3996,I would recommend the full specialization for anyone interested in web field 
3997,great hands on course materialgreat delivery by prof. Muppala
3998,Very good. i liked this course. Thank you.
3999,Great course
4000,Excellent! Especially after taking previous course on Bootstrap and JQuery and realize how same website can be converted to AngularJS easily and why this is better.
4001,Not happy with this course.
4002,Great course. I had a lot of fun. Structure of the course is very good.
4003,Love
4004,??timo curso!??timo conte??do!??timo instruto!
4005,Good course
4006, The teacher is very good! He explains very well and the material is very carefully prepared. Great Course! 
4007,Awesome course! Expecting Angular2 or React taught by this amazing teacher
4008,"A good introduction to AngularJS, but falls short on connecting the dots in places."
4009,Remarkable.
4010,awesome
4011,It was really a extremely good course.
4012,"The teacher is very comprehensive and very serious and provides a lot of supplementary reading materials, I like it very much."
4013,"Angular 1 not Angular 2 which is disappointing but worse still, it teaches use of scope which is no longer recommended by the angular team themselves.Could be vastly improved by using modern angular best practice such as Controller As syntax and teaching you to write code that is more compatible with Angular 2"
4014,"Pros: a lot of good content, worth 8 weeks of study, so good bang for the buck. Takes modular approach, where things are gradually taken apart and shown how to improve using another Angular module or approach. Cons: can be a little academical, very time-intensive.I have a much better understanding now of MVC concept using JS framework. "
4015,"Excellent course, thank you very much teacher for its depth on the issues and passion for what he does !!"
4016,Excellent course
4017,good course
4018,Very good course. Absolutely recommendable.
4019,Great course!
4020,So good i love it so much . Thank you
4021,very practical
4022,"This course is deceivingly full of content. If you want to get through this course you need to have a lot of time on your hands because of the shear amount of debugs your code will produce even if you follow the steps to the letter. So many things are taught over a 4 week period that if you do not do the extra reading to understand what is happening you will get an overview of angularjs, bower, gulp, grunt, yo, yeoman and so on without really knowing how to use any of these tools again. Also because of the number of interdependent parts to the application you create, when the professor decides to give you one of the html or js files again to do an assignment, chances are everything will break and you will spend a long time figuring out which variables' names have been changed and blabla... The professor does not give you a good basis for debugging your code, you need to modify the set up of gulp to show understandable stack traces to figure out what is going wrong. If you want a challenging course where you have to go the extra mile learning things from documentation and blogs to substitute the lack of detail in order to complete the course, than this is the course for you!I think this course needs to be restructured and the length increased to 6 weeks instead of 4, with more detailed content and understand of each tool and especially more on angularjs"
4023,Excellent course!
4024,Very good course and teacher!
4025,"Excellent course, the professor is fantastic with his explanations and the course gives a great foundation to build upon."
4026,My First course with Coursera . loved it.
4027, Great 
4028,Excellent introduction!
4029,The great one!
4030,Excellent Course. Excellent Professor. 
4031,Very good. Thank you
4032,"Not a bad course, but videos must be shorter. Divide 30-40 min videos into small ones"
4033,Good :D
4034,Very good course.. Assignments should be independent of lectures to test understanding.
4035,Excellent! 
4036,great class
4037,Muito bom. Entretanto poderia ser melhor caso fosse elaborado com os alunos um projeto mais complexo e abordados mais assuntos. O n??vel do curso foi bem b??sico.
4038,"Update:Coursera or the course content provider has changed this course in a bad way: You have to PAY for the course IN FULL AMOUNT JUST to get your assignments submitted and reviewed by peer learner.What a pity. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great course! Material is very useful and interesting!The course introduces concepts in a progressive and comprehensive way so that knowledge is easy to be understood. Practise quiz and assignments perfectly reflects course materials.Also, professor Muppala is quite funny. Enjoy the course!"
4039,best angular course I have seen
4040,"Amazing, nothing less :)"
4041,Amazing course. Helped learn a new framework very quickly :D
4042,It is a good course to know AngulerJS
4043,"The course is very good, the teacher very clear, easy to follow. In yet it is a basic course"
4044,"excellent course, assignments and marvelous teacher. Though an example of writing personal directive would be a nice addition."
4045,What better way to understand angular JS than doing hands on project. The transformation of entering into learning angular JS with bootstrap is something I loved about this course. Thank you Professor Jogesh Muppala. It is a great learning experience.
4046,Very interesting course
4047,Great course. A lot of information in lectures and detailed tasks for assignments. The course gives the review and the basis of Angular and helps to create your own Angular application. Thanks
4048,Really the best!!! But It will be good if lecture includes some errors we can make and silly mistakes which affects results adversely. Jogesh sir is very good teacher and he is clear and brief in less time
4049,"Great teacher, AngularJS it's awesome..."
4050,Top
4051,Very very good course!!
4052,"Excelente curso, un gran agradecimiento al profesor Jogesh por su maravilloso curso, explicaciones y distribuci??n de los contenidos, apropiados, acertados, con ejemplos claros y totalmente coherentes con los contenidos.Great course, special thanks to Jogesh for your well defined contents and explanations. Wish you understand some spanish :D"
4053,Very good course
4054,very good!
4055,"Takes a bit of time to get adjusted to the workflow. It's a bit trial and error, especially if your using Windows. Best bet is to use a unix-terminal so if you have windows use a terminal like Git Bash. Overall it's a very good course and gets you into the meat and bones of Web Development. Just remember to come with patience and do things on time :)."
4056,Nice course for beginners
4057,Very helpful course 
4058,"Superb guidance, hands-on project, rich extensions and ample opportunities for learning new things.One of the best specializations!"
4059,Best Angular and task runners course!
4060,"Well Organized, and very informative and practical course. Touches as well on the important concepts like dependency injection design pattern and its use in Angular JS."
4061,I really enjoyed this course; it has given me a really good platform of AngularJS to build upon.
4062,This instructor is awesome.
4063,it 's amzing AngularJS's course and a good teacher ... Thank you
4064,Good to begin with Angular
4065,Great course...
4066,Pity that people had to spend more time on making the plugins work than actually doing the exercises/assignments but good content nonetheless.
4067,Very good course overall. It could dig into a little more detail but given the duration and workload it's still pretty good. I think it's targeted towards people who are either working or studying full-time and taking this on the side.
4068,"Thank you for this great course. Great teacher, really useful assignment which push my skills to understand more of angular's way. Very recommended"
4069,Great class. Very in depth. 
4070,"Overall, this is a very effective introduction to AngularJS. AngularJS can be intimidating or confusing, and this course is largely an introduction, but the videos and exercises do a great job of letting you get over the initial learning curve. This course will give you a thorough foundation in AngularJS, way better than any other free course online, and will give you an idea of where you can go off and explore on your own if you're interested in going on to develop intermediate skills. My only critique of this course is that I really had to explore the additional materials at the end of each section to get a grasp of some of the concepts. I found that some of the videos oversimplified pretty complicated subjects and weren't thorough enough to allow you to complete some of the exercises. I also think the course briefly introduces some pretty complicated tools too early to new developers and doesn't do a good job of explaining their value (like Grunt and Gulp). However, this course is still amazing for a free course. If you've done any of the quick tutorials in AngularJS (like codeacademy's), you've really only scratched the surface of AngularJS. A hands-on course like this give you a much better foundation. To conclude, despite it's minor flaws, this is still the best free introduction to AngularJS online today. Good luck!"
4071,"Great combination of theory and practical, gives good understanding of angular and framework."
4072,"Professor's lecture is pretty good, and assignment is well designed."
4073,"Hard work, I had to watch most of the videos at least twice so took much more time than I anticipated. I'm glad I stuck with it because it made the start of the next course much easier. Very satisfying to have completed it. "
4074,zero to hero
4075,"The course is very good. My only point of concern is the installation procedures of packages, where the instructor either is installing an old package or not using any new installation procedures causing students to have a whole lot of issues with setting up their development environment"
4076,"The perfect course to start learning about Angular, the professor is incredible, full recommended this course, It help me a lot."
4077,Excellent course well explained everything . I liked the additional resources also.
4078,Amazing!!!
4079,Provides a thorough knowledge but could be extended to one more week to cover testing part.
4080,"Very well explained, great teacher! "
4081,Really good course to get your feet wet! A good mix of theory and exercises. Loved it!
4082,"This course is good only for newbies and very high-level. No advanced info about Angrular. No tricks. No info about custom directives, $watch, digest cycle, etc. I had expected more detailed course"
4083,Great course with excellent lections and homeworks.
4084,Great course. Jogesh has done wonderful job in designing the hands on exercises.
4085, a very good introduction to angularJS
4086,"You get to learn a lot about AngularJS and other tools. I enjoyed learning this course. It was demanding at times but in the process you get to learn a lot of things, so it was rewarding."
4087,"This one was much tougher than the previous two courses. Out of four weeks, I ended up delivering my assignments overdue on three occasions, which really has not impact on your grade, but it shows that this time around it is a bit more difficult to complete them. AngularJS is the bread and butter in the industry. All in all, I would say you could already code a basic website from head to toe, including very basic server setup, after completing this class."
4088,Good Angular exercises. But I think that testing should get its own segment. Becomes a bit lengthy with 30 min videos and only scraping the surface on the subject.
4089,"The course is nice, however the assignments are the same every time and the pace is too slow. The final week suddenly too compact, and testing/yo is not assigned at all."
4090,Excellent course. I will follow also some others or all the next courses of this specialization.
4091,Very good course and very pleasant Professor !
4092,Excellent Course. Good teaching and coverage of wide range of topics. 
4093,"Very good overview and step by step dive into this javascript framework. The instructor knows how to deliver one piece of information at a time and with simple exercices to put it into practice.The assignments are not very hard, but they give you confidence in what you have learned."
4094,The progression in this course is amazing! You will see how your web page is transformed beautifully into different modules. MVC concept is clearly illustrated and implemented in this course.
4095,"Excelente curso. O professor ?? conhecer da tecnologia, demonstrou bastante embasamento ao lecionar. O conte??do, os exerc??cios e trabalhos s??o suficientes para o aprendizado."
4096,Great course. Gived me a good knowledge and understanding of an AngularJs.I would like to take all the courses of this specialisation.
4097,good course
4098,Muppala!!!!!!
4099,"FAntastic course. With a great illustration, you progressively build a full dynamic website using json server. "
4100,Nice Course helped me to learn Angular JS
4101,just love the fact that there is a course on angularJS
4102,Very amazing course!
4103,Very good lesson! With good material and good explanation of everything! 
4104,Awesome
4105,Love it
4106,"Tougher than the Bootstrap course, but it was worth it."
4107,excellente course!!
4108,A very good course.I did not have such an experience even in the classroom.The course was fantastic.Thank you from the heart to all teachers and the coursera community.
4109,Great course.
4110,useful course.
4111,Really good course!
4112,good quality
4113,"Good explanation with examples.Few examples need changes in gulp file to run and view the output. For beginners, it may be tough to understand and make changes. Please handle it."
4114,"Jogesh K. Muppala is a great professor, funny, entertaining and knowledgeable. The examples he provides work well and offer a great introduction to Angular."
4115,"Fun course, learn how to create a basic Angular website without getting too overwhelmed."
4116,simply a great course! it's long but the time dedicated to it os worth it.
4117,este ?? um curso excelente
4118,"Highly recommended for beginners! The professor explain concepts in a neat, well-paced and clear manner. There's ample support for all the assignments too!"
4119,"Was very difficult to follow. This is a complex subject and the prof is trying his best, but there are times the explanation is not sufficient. Instructions for installing gulp was not good. I was unable to complete the following exercises after gulp installation failed. Instruction needs to be short and crisp. Building on top of each other project has its negative. There must be solution at the end or at least a check point where you can start clean for the next project."
4120,The course is escellent! The teacher is excellent!
4121,Thanks for this introduction to AngularJS.Unfortunately we have to pay in order to obtain a certificate of accomplishment.
4122,"Great course, didactial and very well explained"
4123,"More on Angular, less on Gulp and Grunt. Lectures about them are so tedious, and when you need them you get the finished code and modify it via tutorial :)"
4124,"Too long videos, you should make more short videos, instead of one boring long video. You speak too slow and that makes a 8 minutes video turns into 30 minutes video."
4125,steps for exercises are not clear.
4126,Much more than I expected from the course organizers. Great work!
4127,This course is amazing. I am learning a lot with Mr. Muppala. Thank you!
4128,great teacher with an solid approach . the course is full of exercises and built in a way to increment as bigger project .Excellent !!!
4129,Good course for the introduction to Angular JS
4130,Great course for beginners. Very well explained. Thanks!
4131,well done
4132,The course is amazing! The only thing I'd like to be corrected is the subtitles. There are lots of mistakes that disturb our learning.
4133,Nice course.
4134,Good and useful course! Try it!
4135,"Very interesting course and very well structured. The subjects are handled with the correct depth corresponding to its importance. The indicated time spent by week corresponds accurately to the time needed, if you have some previous experience in web development. The exercises are focused in the important details and very well organized. If you have interest in client side web development and particularly in Angular, this is a very good opportunity to learn. Probably in a near future this course must be updated to cover Angular 2.0.It really worth the time spent!"
4136,Awesome course
4137,An excellent course! Thank you so much for providing wonderful explanations to all the lectures!
4138,"As the rest of the courser, this one is another example of a good job"
4139,The most relevant course I have done in Coursera
4140,The paste of the lectures is too slow. Much too slow
4141,Great course. Very methodical and a great example of incremental learning. Every assignment built on the previous assignment and I always felt I was being very well guided through my first learning experience with Angularjs. 
4142,"Awesome course content, nice explanation by the tutor. Must for beginners who want to have a start with AngularJS, grunt, gulp and other tools."
4143,Excellent course!!!
4144,Not bad!
4145,Excelente
4146,A very well explained course
4147,"Good course, especially good is coverent grunt and gulp which is very useful, also angular is covered very well for start. I learned a lot, even if i have some of angular knowledge."
4148,Great course. Lots of hands on tasks
4149,Great course and very good explanations of the concepts.
4150,Great introduction to Angular! Learnt a lot.
4151,very good teacher and good hard working course
4152,"Great course. Well explained, well prepared.Thank you!"
4153,super detailed and professional materials!
4154,This course is very well done and gives a very good understanding of angular framework.
4155,"great course!week 4 a little bit overloaded of topics, but still great"
4156,"Excellent course, this course is very well planned and covered a lot of ground. In additional to angular itself, it covers the tooling, automation test utilities that support angular, this make the course very practical and in-depth. Professor Muppala designs this specification very well and make it easy to follow, but yet learning the important detail."
4157,Jogesh Muppala did a great job in this course!Angular simple and direct
4158,"I think it's a very good introduction to AngularJS. You learn and understand what you're doing in almost lessons. I'd hardly recommend it to any beginner !!!I found that the 4rth week was very very compressed. You could spend 1 more week explaining all the Front-End tools such as Gulp, Grunt, Yo (Yeoman) etc. And go deeper with the AngularJS as well. In some points I felt myself alone with no teacher support regardless there's a students forum. I'd improve the transparency and the communication teacher-student. Anyway I very happy to spent that time on this course he explains really paciently :D"
4159,Very good course as for me!
4160,"Very good course, just a few notes short of excelence."
4161,"I liked this course, especially in the way is built. The subject was not so easy but anyway, thanks to the organization of lectures and exercises, i was able to achieve the target.The teacher is good and clear in the explanation."
4162,"Although a good introduction course, sometime is focus on javascript tools rather than on AngularJS itself which, in hand, looses time and doesn't explain/give examples on how to create directives and filters, which are two core functionalities of this framework."
4163,Very useful course.
4164,Excellent course. Going through all the exercises and doing the assignments was a great way to get introduced to Front-end development for me.
4165,Great Course
4166,"Dr Muppala and HKUST have produced a real winner here. The lecture material is explained very well, and the exercises are carefully crafted to focus your attention on the current lesson without being distracted by stuff that is not necessarily relevant. The course builds on previous courses, but those are not necessarily required for understanding this one -- it stands on its own. By the end of the course, the student should have a clear understanding of how Angular.js works, what are its strengths and weaknesses, and how to build applications using this tool set. Supporting tools (build tools, test tools) are also covered."
4167,Lecturer make the course more interesting !!
4168,Great course! Excellent teacher!
4169,"A lot of material for one course. Would appreciate more discussion of package managers, how to find packages that may be useful."
4170,The homework is the best practice for hands on. Excellent material 
4171,Very useful course! 
4172,Just Excelent! Thank you all the people who did this possible! I learned a lot! :D
4173,Great course for overview of Angular JS and other useful techologies connecte
4174,"Pretty good coverage of Angular as whole, how to setup a Angular project, and how it fits into bigger picture web development.Criticisms: - Overall, the code presentation (in exercises, provided files, and the slides) was ugly. Good looking and properly styled code is important to ingrain, and this course fell pretty short there. Code was (very) poorly indented, had inconsistent single vs. double quotes, and didn't follow any style guide out there. Use some beautifier and make sure jshint doesn't have any suggestions for improvement! Slides need at least some monospaced font; better would be colored code snippets or screenshots. - The Gulp and Grunt week felt pretty strangely structured. The two task runners just had such long lectures videos that it was a really big hump to get over, especially since we didn't use Grunt later. - (harder to fix) My files got pretty inconsistent with what I needed to copy/download over week-by-week from the course. Some sort of git repository and easier way to pull changes would be good. I ended up version controlling every week and every week's assignment.So yeah, I'd say this was worth taking, but some parts of the setup are pretty frustrating and version controlling makes life much easier."
4175,"The course is excellent; however, it requires more time than promised..."
4176,"Amount of AngularJS topics covered by the course is too small. All assignments are very typical, just copy-paste from lecture exercises."
4177,Easy to follow course with raising complexity. Same example from the beginning helping to better understand the need for different tools and objects. Very well structured and even fun to follow
4178,"This course had some rough spots here and there, but taking it as a whole, I still give it 5 stars. Why?a) The professor. Professor Jogesh has a great sense of humour and was entertaining enough to keep the classes lively and entertaining to the end. (Even if I did play the video at 2x speed most of the time :)b) The forums. There were a lot of experienced dudes on the forums who were willing to help out with bugs and any configuration issues. The professor also appeared on the forums from time to time. That's gold dust when learning a topic for the first time.c) Depth and pace of coverage. A lot of different topics were introduced and covered well enough for me to be able to use them in my projects and to further explore them without feeling overwhelmed.d) The assignments. They were not too daunting, but were excellent to drive home key points covered in the lectures.e) Peer review of assignments. I learnt some good techniques by reviewing the code of more experienced fellow classmates taking the course.f) Most important of all, the structure and pace of the course were balanced well enough for me to stay with it and to feel that I'd learnt a lot by its end. You will not be an AngularJS expert after 4 weeks, but will have covered relevant subtopics in enough depth to be able to progress further with confidence."
4179,Very good course !
4180,Great Course!! A Must!!
4181,"Interesting content, but sooo slow. 20 minutes long videos could have been done in 5 minutes. Moreover, the teacher's voice and tone did nothing to make the content live."
4182,very interesting and well structured! i'm interested in one more specialized now!
4183,Thank you Professor Muppala. I learned lot of thinks and enjoyed this course.I was able to complete all the assignment with the help of this tutorials.It is organized in a very good manner. 
4184,Very detailed and interesting
4185,"Very good Course , professor makes course very easy."
4186,It is good course to learn Angular JS for beginner. It explained well how to use web tools with angular and how to start with it. 
4187,"I love the style of the courses in this specialization. The exercises are useful and set you up for the assignments. I also really appreciate how the instructor guides you in the use of tools like bower, grunt, gulp and yo, and that he takes the time to cover unit and end-to-end testing. Looking forward to the next course!"
4188,Very practical approach to teach AngularJS
4189,Great course. Very useful
4190,great course!!!!!!
4191,"Excellent teacher! Excellent discipline and way of teaching, being practical, critic and a lot fun.I'm really enjoy all the courses. This teacher is essencial to the course success."
4192,"Very useful material, the professor teaches it at a good pace and at an easy to understand level, the exercises are easy to follow and replicating the professor's steps is very simple (except for the Gulp steps, but that's not graded anyway), so you can follow how he did what he did"
4193,"Excellent course! All the material was relevant and the exerises were challenging without being impossible. Professor Muppala is a very entertaining instructor. All three courses in the specialization so far have exceeded expectations. The only remark so far is the subpar quality of the subtitles in this course. There were many mistakes in nearly every video. Other than that, great work!"
4194,I missed a lot of it because many NPM modules wouldn't install on my Windows environment. :(
4195,A well-organized course that makes you ??????do the puzzles one by one.
4196,Perfecto para empezar con AngularJS
4197,Excellent Course and Excellent Teacher
4198,It's a good course to start with this technology
4199,"Fantastic course, all explained very clearly"
4200,its a great course with so much to learn in a short period. course is well structured and intructor knows his stuff. the assignments are well designed to reinforce the presentations
4201,Good Course
4202,"What an awesome course. The teacher is top-class, really knows the subject, and how to continually explain each module. The video exercises are just made for the student to grasp the content. One of the best courses I hev experienced on Coursera."
4203,"Great course, I had a lot of fun"
4204,Very good course
4205,After completion I got a pretty good understanding about AngularJS and its features.
4206,very very very very good course. I learned quite a lot from it. Thanks Professor.
4207,I liked this Course. Now i am familiar with AngularJS. Thank you
4208,Very good.
4209,Great Course and really great professor
4210,"Good introduction to AngularJS. Moreover their provide a wide variety of additional information related to the course, which is very useful to enlarge the basic contents studied."
4211,awesome course!!!
4212,great course
4213,"Very good course. It allows to learn the basics of angular js very fast and easily. I only missed a little more of content in directives scopes, but here you can learn a lot."
4214,Amazing material and teaching style excellent!
4215,Great teacher. Great Angular overview. I wish the instruction went deeper into Angular than it did.
4216,"Covers End 2 End web application development with AngularJS, Learned a lot and got me going with web app development."
4217,This is an awesome course! Many interesting and useful topics were taught. I'm looking forward for your next courses.
4218,Great Course
4219,I love this instructor.
4220,Great course !
4221,I 
4222,"NIce and very usefull course to get started with angular and web tools such as grunt, gulp and yeoman"
4223,"Clear, Pleasant and Useful!"
4224,Very good course and very well organized. Is a must if you want you want to learn angular from the begining.
4225,Excellent course for beginners .
4226,Great course! 
4227,One of the best tutorial!!!! You will never regret :)
4228,Awesome!!
4229,Awesome course! I have learned so much!
4230,"The professor is really great, very clear and understandable course."
4231,Excellent Course.Just Superb.Great Professor.
4232,Excellent Course!
4233,it was excellent
4234,"I have completed 2 MOOCs till but am very happy with the new curriculum,dividing the course into small modules.I am showing interest when am watching videos,clear explanation and fully satisfied with this course.Thank you"
4235,Excellent course!!Easy to follow..course organisation is really good. :-) 
4236,We have a very cool Profesor on this course!If you think AngularJS is hard to learn you will change your mind after this course!Thank you Jogesh K. Muppala for sharing your knowledge!
4237,Excellent cours sur AngularJS
4238,Great course and professor.
4239,Excellent Course
4240,Very nice course teaches you a real life examples.Lots of thanks to the trainer because i do understand in a very easy way.
4241,Very good tutorials...
4242,The course is very boring and monotonous. It should be made more engaging. One needs to capture the concentration of students for a subject like Angular.
4243,i like a javascript. and i really thanks to hong kong university for this course and coursera.org also.
4244,Very comprehensive course 
4245,hola
4246,"I was able to grasp the overview of the course. The instructions are delivered well and the flow seems in order. However my lack of background with the topic discussed cause me to stop watching everything. Plus, I can't do the said assignment because I am a beginning on this topic. it seems this is not a course for me to rate based on content. However I will rate it in terms of the aesthetic, organization or structure of the slides . The organization of the content of the slides needs to be properly organized. Long paragraphs are a pain to read. Further when comparing, two concepts, it is easier to comprehend when they are in table form. For instance in FrontEnd JavaScript Framework Overview video, it is better in terms of organization and aesthetic to show library vs. framework in table form.Also, the volume of Introduction to AngularJS video is too loud. Though I can adjust it and lower the volume, but sudden high volume sound is discouraging when the next video has normal volume causing me to adjust it again. I was only able to watch few of the videos but they are good. Just a little improvement needed. "
4247,Great course! 
4248,"Excellent course.Gives you a hands-on approach to Angular JS, with links to more resources so that you can explore further and find all information you need to build a complete project."
4249,There are no better ways than this! It's a great course and i would really recommend it for anyone because i gained more experience i never grasp before doing AngularJs course from another source and find the technique in this course more easier to understand too. 
4250,great class. assignment 4 is a killer. make sure you really learn things in first assignments instead of just copy and paste.
4251,really great course with awesome professor
4252,Highly recommended course. Helped a lot to get deeper understanding and later translate the knowledge to knew projects. Some topics you might need to watch more than one time.
4253,"A tough course, requires consistent hard work!!!!"
4254,Practical and interesting.
4255,Great Course! 
4256,Great course! I just had some little problems with some explanations but it was just once. Thank you very much Coursera and University of Hong Kong and proffesors :)
4257,"Great course. It is great for learning Angular1. we can learned with angular term services, controller, model, templates, dependency injection, filter.. Great for angular basic and we develop project along course."
4258,"At first I didn't know the value of this course. Every one just criticized me by saying that this is a time waste and need to concentrate more on back-end. But, now a days everyone is moving towards angularJs and updating their frameworks using Angular. Now, people who blamed me, were coming to me and saying that I was lucky knowing about this. Now, I knew the value about this. Thanks for the course !"
4259, Excellent instructor with a sense of humor. Nicely organized course. You'll learn - if you're willing to. Invest more time than suggested. -- Iftekhar Ahmad Chowdhury
4260,Great course!
4261,Great Learning
4262, Excelente 
4263,"Great course, great materials, great technology."
4264,"Thanks all for this greate course, I want to give special thank to our teacher Mr Jogesh K. Muppala."
4265,great class.
4266,"This was very difficult course for me (as for newbie). But at the same time it broadened my horizons. AngularJS - very interesting course. I'm glad to become graduate. Special thanks to professor Jogesh K. Muppala for his intelligence, kindness and excellent sense of humour. Also thanks to all people, who made a major contribution to this course: record videos, write subtitles, correct code, consulting as mentors. So I wish prosperity to this course and lots of success!"
4267,Nicely designed course to learn AngularJS
4268,"Covers all the essential topics. At the end of the course, one should have enough confidence to try and deploy pages on their own. The topics are well explained and the teacher keeps the listener engaged with his teaching style."
4269,Course is very compact and informative
4270,Very well explained from basics
4271,It is a awesome course
4272,Great course to be introduced in AngularJS and learn the basic functionality of this framework.
4273,"Should be a more in depth course.Although for an introduction into AngularJS, it is a very good course."
4274,I've been trying to learn Angular for so long! This course finally demystified the basics for me.
4275,Awesome course
4276,Its great!
4277,Overall course arrangement is awsome
4278,Excelent course
4279,Wonderful course to learn AngularJS. Thank you to Jogesh K Muppala for explaining in a each and every topic and excercises more practically.
4280,"Apart from angular i learn task runners, testings, scaffolds and more. Love this one!"
4281,"This is excellent training for the person who likes to keep up with the latest and greatest front-end developments. If you don't like to switch up and turn on a dime then this course is not for you. I had trouble aplenty and yet the point seemed to be: stay flexible, be prepared to use obscure tools (that are supposed to make the site work better but who knows exactly what is happening under the hood), expect change and adversity, become an expert at debugging that crappy code and refactoring everything at the drop of a hat. This is probably good approximation of real world experience where you would need to come in on a project and bail them out of angularjs damnation. Be prepared to be frustrated."
4282,It was a challenging and a fun course. Good in-depth and hands on experience on Angular and other web-tools.
4283,Excelent!
4284,"Very nice course! You should include an explanation of the versions of the angular components that are compatible, it could be very releasing."
4285,Excellent course!
4286,"some difficult, but it's so useful and powerful languages"
4287,Perfect course to get started with AngularJS
4288,Great course to learn about AngularJS. Syllabus is good to provide step by step and deep learning. Examples are good to provide practice practices with steps. Assignment is also a good test for the knowledge learned in each week. 
4289,Great course.
4290,Must for a new age programmer
4291,amazing course gave me in-depth knowledge of Angular.js framework!
4292,comprehensive 
4293, This is a Great Course. However I think that is a wonderful option to have an intermediate leve with angularJs. 
4294,Should be updated with angular 2 components. Rest it was awesome
4295,good and useful course 
4296,"This was my first online course. I have everyday given 2 to 3.30hrs in this course. As angular.js is really in demand, I was eager to learn it and this course is good in terms of the lectures by prof. Muppala , materials and the exercises. Exercises are doable but let me say this to the would be en-rollers that if you miss a tiny winy thing between the scrips, you will have to devote a hell lotta time to fix it . The assignments are challenging and those gave me the feel that angular is not that easy peasy at all. Submitting the assignments on time is suggestible as late submission can create a mess to get required number of reviews on time. I have submitted two assignments after deadline and had to request a lot of classmates to review my submission. Prof Muppala is one great teacher. He is good at explaining stuffs so easily which are actually not that easy. Overall it was a good experience. I am looking forward to what this skill will offer me in my career ahead and also looking forward to learn more from coursera. "
4297,"The lessons were well structured and easy to follow, while covering all of the essential topics needed to use Angular, including some server-side development tools. As an introductory course, it met my expectations."
4298,"I can't even begin to describe how much pain this course gave me.The code snippets and instructions in the exercise videos are incomplete/have errors and it's impossible to complete the exercises just using those (it's hours of extra work to get things working). Also, at some point you are given a new version of part of the files in the project, which won't match the rest of the files so there's remedial work to be done for that too. Some of these issues were flagged on the forum 5 months ago and still the course material wasn't updated. It all gets even worse as all assignments build upon the code written in these exercises.The assignment instructions are unclear. You are shown a demo of how the solution should look in the assignment videos, and then you are told you actually have to build something different than what you were shown. I also couldn't understand some of the grading criteria. You will get/lose marks on uploading a screenshot or naming variables/functions a certain way.I was really interested in this specialization so I kept going hoping it will get better but it only got worse. After 11 weeks of work I am ready to start something different. Wasn't expecting such low quality content on Coursera."
4299,We need Angular 2
4300,Awesome course for a good startup!!!
4301,"Very Good Course to learn. Assignments are very good,"
4302,very satisfied 
4303,superb course
4304,Best Ever!
4305,Superb course
4306,love it
4307,The most complete course for angular beginners. Grat job teacjer Mupala =D
4308,good. its a worth your time
4309,Excellent break down of Angular JS. A very good introduction; you will still need to read the Angular JS docs to get depth.
4310,"This course was too messy. I spent 75% of my time to get the examples to work. It would have been better if after each module all the .js and .html files would be given in total, not just the snippets."
4311,Great Course. Have a wide knowledge about Angular js.
4312,Amazing instructor!
4313,Very Good course. Recommended
4314,It was a great course
4315,this course is good . thank you for this information .we look forward more
4316,"The course was really demanding for me but in the end you feel like you achieved something. Don't give up if your localhosts don't work, there are solutions, look it up."
4317,Great
4318,Great course. AngularJS is presented gradually with good manners. Super work by Jogesh K. Muppala.
4319,A well presented course with broad coverage of AngularJS. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The Coursera platform is excellent and easy to use.
4320,Good content and awesome instructor :)
4321,sir you are best .. i learnt so much from you and i really appreciatie your work for students
4322,"Exercise sources are not up to date, I have come across many problems."
4323,perfect
4324,The course is well structured. 
4325,Great! I have really learned a lot by attending this course. Hope to see the AngularJS 2 or React course anytime soon :)
4326," Amazing Course, made me understand Angular in an easy way. It gave me a good quick start. Hats of to the teacher for all the hard work."
4327,Very easy to understand.E
4328,Great Course
4329,Excellent 
4330,Awesome course
4331,666
4332,very helpful for newbies
4333,Rushed though the core material. 
4334,Definitely Not for young new front end learners .Lots of things difficult to understand.
4335,Nice course getting into AngularJS programming foundations and some very useful tools.
4336,"Good course, cover most important topics in didatc way. But the code quality is poor and I advice to study the John Papa's Angula code style to learn a better way of using AngularJS."
4337,Easy to understand.
4338,"This great course will teach you not only how to create a single page application, but it will also show you the basics about developing to the web, as it shows you the tools that will allow you to work better as a web developer."
4339,This was a hard course and many of the exercises did not have enough details to complete the assignments on time. I had to rely on course forums and a lot of googling to finish the course successfully. 
4340, The course was very clear and interesting! 
4341,Nice course. However I am hearing scratching noises when the tutor is speaking which is little disturbing.
4342,"A bit outdated now, however it is still a good resource to get started."
4343,Thank you for providing new Angulagr js course 
4344,Very useful course with excellent course material. However there were some problems with the audio quality. Fixing them would make this course really enjoyable.
4345,Not well designed and the professor hard to follow...
4346,Nice!! I can write a web application now!
4347,good
4348,Thank you !
4349,Excellent source of information.
4350,"Angular is very extensive, difficult to understand, but the teacher finds the way putting together everything, Excellent course, the best until now. "
4351,very good
4352,This is the best course in getting the basic understanding of AngularJS. I really did get a lot out this course and I would highly recommend anyone for trying to learn angularJs. The organization and the layout of the course and also the professor explanation of the concept are really great!!
4353,Nice Course. Professor makes it more easy and interesting to learn. Thank You Sir.
4354,very well structured for learning at our own space!
4355,"AngularJS is The brain in the front-end development, and it was the most difficult part of this specialization so far, regarding all the concepts behind, like TDD, REST, MVC, etc. Once that you understand all of these concepts, the course is great. Professor Joggesh explains the angular features in a comprehensive way and his references to external links are a must."
4356,very interesting course
4357,Super good start for people without any javascript experience. But you will need more in real life :)
4358,The teacher is amazing
4359,Nice Course 
4360,"I loved this coursed, it allowed me to get more opportunities in my work field, I highly recommend it."
4361,thx
4362, This course is the best part of the Full Stack series. I would like to see a more advance course just on Angular.
4363,"it is good , but some items needs to be illustrated in more details , a great thing of this course is that it gives a lot of practice exercises "
4364,Great introduction to angular.js
4365,Very nice explanations!
4366,"A nice overview on Angular JS, just enough to get you started!"
4367,There are steps that are missing at times which require you to scour for help. There are also quirks that aren't mentioned that other students have to point out. Unaddressed questions in the discussion board required escalation. Feels rushed and it's hard to learn for a beginner. Feels like you're just going through the motions and copy and pasting code.
4368,I am a bit disappointed by this course. I was expecting a more fast paced course with more information regarding Angular. Unfortunately in the videos there is a lot of time spent on unnecessary details and reading out loud the source code. The exercises are quite basic and they did not pose real challenges - except for errors coming from mismatched packages or mistakes in configuration files. Also I think that the level of support provided by the mentors of this course is lacking. Mentors are quite absent and very late in providing any help in the forums so the students have to kind of counsel one another - that is sometimes good but a proper class also requires a good level of supervision.All in all I think this is an OK course that is mostly geared to the uninitiated. It needs some serious work to make it a great course.
4369,Amazing course!
4370,a great course and good instructor.
4371,"Great Course for angular 1.x for angular newbies.It includes almost all the angular basic concept,including module,controller,service,filter,directive,view,data model,expressions,two way binding,dependency injection.And also this course provides a good full example illustrating how to use angular CRUD app.However,finishing this course is far from being proficient in angular developing,you should keep practicing more and find more resources from angular official websites."
4372,"very informative and challenging course, i enjoyed finishing it."
4373,Teacher is really bad. Terrible.
4374,I definitely enjoyed doing this course. The exercises really helped me understand it and it makes you more involved. 
4375,very useful course
4376,Everything is clearly explained! Practice was great!
4377,j'ai trouv?? le contenu tr??s enrichissant et utile.
4378,Superb Course!!!!
4379,A wonderful course! Good theory with coll practices!
4380,nice course and sequenced well.
4381,Good.
4382,Quite helpful
4383,Great course!
4384,"Best full stack courses, even after this single course you can separately make a powerful front end"
4385,La verdad este curso es de lo mejor te da las herramientas para que puedas desarrollar con angular recomendado
4386,Good Course
4387,Best course ever!
4388,Excelent Course!! Very recomended!
4389,Good.
4390,excellent
4391,Fantastic. Very glad to have taken this course.
4392,excellent course
4393,Excellent education!
4394,good course
4395,"This course is excellent, highly recommended"
4396,Had good content but description was a like scattered manner. It could have better if explanation should be in fluent manner.
4397,"Very good course, with much to learn. By applying step by step every aspect of the course was for me very helpful. I hope more and more courses to follow this example."
4398,"Fantastic course, fantastic teacher."
4399, Excelent! 
4400,"A massive amount of content to cover, some of it quite advanced. The exercises become fraught if your code is out of sync with the tutor's code. Things won't work, you won't know why, and there's no real recovery from that. "
4401,great course
4402,Enjoyed the course. It really increased my skills
4403,"Very nice course, but it would be even better if it was about Angular 2, since it is to become the standard AngularJS is/was."
4404,Good course
4405,"A whole lot of information to absorb, that I will definitely agree with! If there was anything I wish went into more detail, there would be two things.1) Yo / Yeoman: This part of the course was more of an Obligatory lecture, just to say it's mentioned. I watched that one video many times over, but still ended up going to YouTube for actual training on the ins and outs. I know time is constrained in MOOC's and you don't get the full load of knowledge you would in a traditional school. However, my thoughts are that either give us an exercise so we can at least have that as experience in using it, or just remove it completely. The lecture was put together as a sort of Follow Along, but it really felt rushed and more of an Obligatory thing than an actual lesson.2) Give us more detail on the difference between Services and Factories. Keep in mind that I still have Multi-Platform Mobile App Development, and Server Side Development with Node.js still to go, so I don't know if these are explained more in those courses. As it stands right now, I -still- don't know the difference between a factory and a service, or even what a provider is. When should I use a factory? When should I use a service? Which is better suited for what task? All those questions I do not have an answer for after this course, which feels a bit short for me. "
4406,very good course
4407,"Very Nice Course. Takes us through everything and enables us with basic promised objective. Good Luck to Course creators, keep adding more to it."
4408,I would recommend the full specialization for anyone interested in web field 
4409,great hands on course materialgreat delivery by prof. Muppala
4410,Excellent! Especially after taking previous course on Bootstrap and JQuery and realize how same website can be converted to AngularJS easily and why this is better.
4411, The teacher is very good! He explains very well and the material is very carefully prepared. Great Course! 
4412,Awesome course! Expecting Angular2 or React taught by this amazing teacher
4413,"A good introduction to AngularJS, but falls short on connecting the dots in places."
4414,It was really a extremely good course.
4415,"Angular 1 not Angular 2 which is disappointing but worse still, it teaches use of scope which is no longer recommended by the angular team themselves.Could be vastly improved by using modern angular best practice such as Controller As syntax and teaching you to write code that is more compatible with Angular 2"
4416,"Pros: a lot of good content, worth 8 weeks of study, so good bang for the buck. Takes modular approach, where things are gradually taken apart and shown how to improve using another Angular module or approach. Cons: can be a little academical, very time-intensive.I have a much better understanding now of MVC concept using JS framework. "
4417,"Excellent course, thank you very much teacher for its depth on the issues and passion for what he does !!"
4418,Excellent course
4419,good course
4420,Very good course. Absolutely recommendable.
4421,Great course!
4422,very practical
4423, Great 
4424,Very good. Thank you
4425,"Not a bad course, but videos must be shorter. Divide 30-40 min videos into small ones"
4426,Muito bom. Entretanto poderia ser melhor caso fosse elaborado com os alunos um projeto mais complexo e abordados mais assuntos. O n??vel do curso foi bem b??sico.
4427,"Amazing, nothing less :)"
4428,Amazing course. Helped learn a new framework very quickly :D
4429,"excellent course, assignments and marvelous teacher. Though an example of writing personal directive would be a nice addition."
4430,What better way to understand angular JS than doing hands on project. The transformation of entering into learning angular JS with bootstrap is something I loved about this course. Thank you Professor Jogesh Muppala. It is a great learning experience.
4431,Very interesting course
4432,Great course. A lot of information in lectures and detailed tasks for assignments. The course gives the review and the basis of Angular and helps to create your own Angular application. Thanks
4433,Top
4434,"Takes a bit of time to get adjusted to the workflow. It's a bit trial and error, especially if your using Windows. Best bet is to use a unix-terminal so if you have windows use a terminal like Git Bash. Overall it's a very good course and gets you into the meat and bones of Web Development. Just remember to come with patience and do things on time :)."
4435,Nice course for beginners
4436,Very helpful course 
4437,Best Angular and task runners course!
4438,"Well Organized, and very informative and practical course. Touches as well on the important concepts like dependency injection design pattern and its use in Angular JS."
4439,I really enjoyed this course; it has given me a really good platform of AngularJS to build upon.
4440,This instructor is awesome.
4441,Pity that people had to spend more time on making the plugins work than actually doing the exercises/assignments but good content nonetheless.
4442,Very good course overall. It could dig into a little more detail but given the duration and workload it's still pretty good. I think it's targeted towards people who are either working or studying full-time and taking this on the side.
4443,"Thank you for this great course. Great teacher, really useful assignment which push my skills to understand more of angular's way. Very recommended"
4444,Great class. Very in depth. 
4445,"Overall, this is a very effective introduction to AngularJS. AngularJS can be intimidating or confusing, and this course is largely an introduction, but the videos and exercises do a great job of letting you get over the initial learning curve. This course will give you a thorough foundation in AngularJS, way better than any other free course online, and will give you an idea of where you can go off and explore on your own if you're interested in going on to develop intermediate skills. My only critique of this course is that I really had to explore the additional materials at the end of each section to get a grasp of some of the concepts. I found that some of the videos oversimplified pretty complicated subjects and weren't thorough enough to allow you to complete some of the exercises. I also think the course briefly introduces some pretty complicated tools too early to new developers and doesn't do a good job of explaining their value (like Grunt and Gulp). However, this course is still amazing for a free course. If you've done any of the quick tutorials in AngularJS (like codeacademy's), you've really only scratched the surface of AngularJS. A hands-on course like this give you a much better foundation. To conclude, despite it's minor flaws, this is still the best free introduction to AngularJS online today. Good luck!"
4446,"Great combination of theory and practical, gives good understanding of angular and framework."
4447,"Professor's lecture is pretty good, and assignment is well designed."
4448,"Hard work, I had to watch most of the videos at least twice so took much more time than I anticipated. I'm glad I stuck with it because it made the start of the next course much easier. Very satisfying to have completed it. "
4449,"The perfect course to start learning about Angular, the professor is incredible, full recommended this course, It help me a lot."
4450,Great course. Jogesh has done wonderful job in designing the hands on exercises.
4451,Very good lesson! With good material and good explanation of everything! 
4452,Thanks for this introduction to AngularJS.Unfortunately we have to pay in order to obtain a certificate of accomplishment.
4453,"Great course, didactial and very well explained"
4454,great teacher with an solid approach . the course is full of exercises and built in a way to increment as bigger project .Excellent !!!
4455,Good course for the introduction to Angular JS
4456,well done
4457,The course is amazing! The only thing I'd like to be corrected is the subtitles. There are lots of mistakes that disturb our learning.
4458,Good and useful course! Try it!
4459,"Very interesting course and very well structured. The subjects are handled with the correct depth corresponding to its importance. The indicated time spent by week corresponds accurately to the time needed, if you have some previous experience in web development. The exercises are focused in the important details and very well organized. If you have interest in client side web development and particularly in Angular, this is a very good opportunity to learn. Probably in a near future this course must be updated to cover Angular 2.0.It really worth the time spent!"
4460,The most relevant course I have done in Coursera
4461,Great course. Very methodical and a great example of incremental learning. Every assignment built on the previous assignment and I always felt I was being very well guided through my first learning experience with Angularjs. 
4462,"Awesome course content, nice explanation by the tutor. Must for beginners who want to have a start with AngularJS, grunt, gulp and other tools."
4463,Not bad!
4464,A very well explained course
4465,"Good course, especially good is coverent grunt and gulp which is very useful, also angular is covered very well for start. I learned a lot, even if i have some of angular knowledge."
4466,Great course. Lots of hands on tasks
4467,Great course and very good explanations of the concepts.
4468,very good teacher and good hard working course
4469,This course is very well done and gives a very good understanding of angular framework.
4470,"great course!week 4 a little bit overloaded of topics, but still great"
4471,Jogesh Muppala did a great job in this course!Angular simple and direct
4472,"I think it's a very good introduction to AngularJS. You learn and understand what you're doing in almost lessons. I'd hardly recommend it to any beginner !!!I found that the 4rth week was very very compressed. You could spend 1 more week explaining all the Front-End tools such as Gulp, Grunt, Yo (Yeoman) etc. And go deeper with the AngularJS as well. In some points I felt myself alone with no teacher support regardless there's a students forum. I'd improve the transparency and the communication teacher-student. Anyway I very happy to spent that time on this course he explains really paciently :D"
4473,Very good course as for me!
4474,"Very good course, just a few notes short of excelence."
4475,"I liked this course, especially in the way is built. The subject was not so easy but anyway, thanks to the organization of lectures and exercises, i was able to achieve the target.The teacher is good and clear in the explanation."
4476,"Although a good introduction course, sometime is focus on javascript tools rather than on AngularJS itself which, in hand, looses time and doesn't explain/give examples on how to create directives and filters, which are two core functionalities of this framework."
4477,Very useful course.
4478,Great course! Excellent teacher!
4479,Great course! 
4480,thanks
4481,Excellent explanation with very nice examples.
4482,Excellent course. Learned a lot about usable security.
4483,the best one
4484,Great course. It opened my mind in a few aspects of day to day privacy and security aspects people tend to ignore.
4485,It's a good course
4486,It was very interesting course! Thank you.
4487,Excellent course filled with plenty of info to get you started thinking about usable security.
4488,"This course really brings security and privacy to life. It connects the technically detailed 'how' of the other courses (cryptography, software and hardware security) with the why. More importantly it helps us make informed choices when designing, and helps us identify the real options."
4489,"Great course, I loved the examples and video of practices throughout the learning!"
4490,A very fascinating and enjoyable course! I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to take the first step in learning about cybersecurity.
4491,Awesome concepts to include in our daily infosec 
4492,"I found this course very interesting. Even if I already have some knowledge of security in general, I was very happy to follow this course and go in details about all aspect of usable security. Lessons are very clear and easy to understand. I will go forward with other security courses."
4493,"A shame it is part of the cybersecurity specialization. It is boring and full of obvious-psicology things like passwords need to be secure but easy to remember. The instructor, at least, seems to have zero knowledge about software development. Everything we did in seven weeks could have been taught in one or two."
4494,"Very interesting course, good material"
4495,great
4496,I learned the psychology of implementing security systems.
4497,"Excellent course, well explained. Not too much things to learn at once. Ideal when you want to start. Would be useful to have also a slide deck next to it for the review and exam preparation."
4498,Liked the structure of the course and the way concepts have been integrated with real life practical examples. Would have loved to understand some examples or references to 'design thinking' consideration of some specific industry problems - like building a payments system or a ticketing system etc.
4499,"There are many parts of the lectures that are very quiet and even with my speakers turned to max, I struggled to hear, while other parts were clear. The course is interesting, but I doubt that anyone would pay to attend this course."
4500,"Aprendi a conciliar as necessidades dos usu??rios e os requisitos de Seguran??a da Informa????o, tornando o sistema mais seguro, eficiente, simples e satisfat??rio."
4501,"I strongly recommend this course to all security software developers, managers and of course to designers."
4502,"Very good, excellent course"
4503, Cool ! 
4504,Thanks for the course. it's very useful for my present job :). 
4505,"would be nice if you could see the questions and answers after you take a quiz or exam, that way its easier to lean where you went wrong on a question."
4506,Nice course with more important info
4507,thanks alot
4508,"Best course to learn about usable security, If you are familiar with Human Computer Interaction then easily can related the security issue in between Human and Machine. "
4509,Well organized. Material is well presented and relevant.
4510,"I am having a very difficult time finishing this course. I find the topic dull and the content uninteresting. It is the first course of the CyberSecurity Specialization .. I hope the other courses are not like this.I rated it one star for a couple of reasons. 1- I have been in software for many years and I know about software design. I would NOT have expected to have a weeks long course on software design and usability when my desire is to learn about software security. I understand its importance, but this course should be part of a UI design course, NOT in a technical CyberSecurity specialization IMO.2 - the course is all about theory, not about practical matters. Let's admit it - today's security software is not for the uninformed/experienced. Given this, again, I feel this course would be better served in another specialization about UI Design or for software design best-practices.That is my .02. I am moving onto other courses before finishing the Usability Security..... I am aware that I will have to complete this course to get my certification. This alone will discourage me from purchasing a specialization in the future."
4511,This course broaden your perspective of security and how are the best ways to design the security of the systems from the perspective of the users.I recommended this course to all programmers and designers no matter what level you have.
4512,this course is amazing
4513,"Exactly what I needed in a concise, interesting and provoking way."
4514,It was a powerful course
4515,Great class. Ms. Golbeck is very clear and the pacing is great. I like that you can skip ahead to the next week if you have the time.
4516,"Covered many topics which are complementary to skills i'm improving or I wanna improve. Also, usability is always something relegated on software engineering so it's valuable to find a course to learn more about it."
4517,"I find this course a good example of online course. It combines proper introductory material, good video courses, reading materials, and quiz. The quiz exercises are a bit challenging, and the final exam has very good questions, which require careful and independent thinking. As the final exam can only be taken once, it increases the challenge of passing this course, and makes the certificate more valuable."
4518,"Muy bueno el curso, mucha informacion util y con ejemplo de casos reales o faciles de aplicar en lo cotidiano"
4519,Great course. I recomend for everyone.
4520,I loved the idea of Security by Design.
4521,Very interesting course that will help you in designing systems that people will want to use!
4522,"The course was pretty good, I certainly learned a lot, but more hands on material would have been nice (Interactive).Thanks"
4523,"This course improved my perspective of security and privacy. The concepts of usability is something I will use on every system I develop from now on. The University of Maryland team does a wonderfull work to keep the understanding easy and completed, much thanks to them."
4524,"Good introduction to usable security, with interesting and illustrative examples and scenarios showing how usable security concepts play out in real life and in tools and services we use on a day to day basis. "
4525,A great course that has completely changed my perception towards software design with the course USABLE SECURITY. The materials and lecture videos are nothing but wonderful. I really had a great time while learning. Thanks
4526,Informative and practical use of Security design
4527,Great course!
4528,Nice course
4529,Very Good course
4530,I did not learn a lot. 
4531,Great education program for usable security 
4532,"This course is about good practices for user interface design. If this is what you are looking for it may be worth your time, just be aware that the production (quality) of the videos is among the worst courses I have taken in Coursera. On the other hand, if you are looking for a heavy Cybersecurity related course I suggest you to stay away from this one, unless you are taking the specialization in which case you don't have other choice.Content: 2.5/5Videos Quality: 1/5Practice/Theory ratio: 1/5 "
4533,"Instructor was easy to follow, made clear points with today's technology examples and kept me engaged during my time."
4534,Great
4535,Very good course.. I learned much!Thank you for this opportunities
4536,"Helps reform UNIX and C lovers, let's not be the BOFH and make usable systems for our users!"
4537,Useful concepts. Quite simple.
4538,Excellent course. A must for every software architect of any software that has human interaction.
4539,Bad sound quality
4540,"Honestly i only finished week 1. I was sorely disappointed that the quizzes were locked. I wasn't aware that if you audit the course you were not allowed to complete the quizzes as other courses offer this option. From what I gather from week 1 the course topics seems really good. I think it would be great if you consider letting persons who audit take the quizzes otherwise what's the use - I mean i could always go on youtube and watch videos on the same topics, the difference with coursera courses is that you get the opportunity to test the knowledge gained by doing quizzes and assignment. I hope you will consider allowing everyone to take the quiz. My issue above is the reason why I gave the course a 1 out of 5."
4541,"I sincerely enjoyed this course. The instructor was clear, concise, and obviously passionate about the subject matter. I appreciate that reading materials were complimentary to the videos. I can say I actually walked away with information I can apply to my career. I gained a new perspective about usability (testing and implementation) that I will be employing in my network authentication practices and policy development."
4542,thanks for the lectures. the best so farvery informative. never knew system designers have to go through a lot to make it usable. wow now am a system designer :)
4543,amazing course and i would recommend it for others for sure
4544,If there were some Powerpoint slides in the course memorising would have been easier. Thanks a lot.
4545,Good Course. But has many generic stuffs. We will get to know about most of the security details that we come across our day today life
4546,Excellent introductory course for increasing your usability and security in soft
4547,Great course!Very interesting and very ingaging content (I would go so far as to say very usable).
4548,Is an excellent course.
4549,This is the first course that will only let you grade the quiz if you purchase the course. Highly disappointed...
4550,Great course! Very intriguing insights regarding security. So many of my 'myths' got busted.
4551,Jen covers the material well but it isn't the most technical
4552,It was really good on content part. I really like the course material. It is going to help me in my current organization project development work. At the same time i want to explore other available courses on cyber security.
4553,"I love this course, I have learn a lot!"
4554,"I've learned a lot in this course about usability. It focuses more on the user and creating a system that works best for the user, rather than the designer. I've also learned how to create better passwords that are more secure and user-friendly. I would recommend this course to anyone."
4555,I think this course was worth taking an I thoroughly enjoyed through every bit of the lessons.
4556,this course helped me to understand designing and usability
4557,"A totally new insights to security. Since I am a Software Engineer student this concepts are going to prove invaluable in my future tasks. Great tutor and Coursera support, love it."
4558,"This course have very little to do with actual security. Most of the time you will hear about how to design applications, and what is a good design policy."
4559,Wonderful concepts presented beautifully. If every software developer take this course; 
4560,"Very excellent course module for usable security, real time examples makes students understand easily."
4561,It is one course which should done by each and every one who is using the computer as it talks about daily security problems and this course will let every one aware about how to keep there password and at what duration User should Change there password to keep there System Secure.
4562,"I like it, but i feel that sometimes need more examples o dynamic"
4563,"Good explanations and detailed. Interesant concepts, developed in a comfortable way."
4564,This course and the Professor are awesome.
4565,Great insight about security and security system design.
4566,Excellent Course. 
4567,Found it very useful. The content is articulated very well and is substantiated with research work &amp; survey. This gives me a way to objectively assess system from security point of view
4568,"An excellent Course on Usable Security &amp; Privacy. Lectures by Jen Goldbeck are practical, peppered with good anecdotes that makes the course interesting. Many concepts that are taught are immediately implementable not just theory. Full Five stars to the course. Thank you Professor.Best Dr Jagan Vaman PhD CISA CGEIT C|CISO"
4569,Very useful content that can be used in our workplaces
4570,"Great exposition of didactic and interactive readings and materials. I was not dissappointed, and as the course advanced, so did the difficulty, i happenned to have a base on the subject, but it was an enjoyable and sometimes funny learning experience."
4571,Good interesting course. Good lecturer. But course shoud covet more information because it's a little bit easy. 
4572,"Was a better course than the other reviewers tended to complain about. Taking the examples literally might not be the best actionable route to completing a lot of the quizzes and final exam, its mostly theory on how to build sustainable and efficient systems while at the same time ensuring the security of them has the least effect on the usability of the information system or applications in mind. Some of the videos were somewhat off topic and seemed to not actually be related to what was on the quizzes at the end of the weeks topic. Some questions on quizzes weren't explained or only hinted at in the videos only to be the main topic in the next week. Other than that, a solid course. "
4573,"This is a basic overview of security issues and user input for web sites, etc. It focuses on design, usability and other issues that affect how people interact with security log-in and other issues.It's a good foundation for looking at your or other's work and knowing the best way for the computer to interact with a user. "
4574,"this course is cool but not hard enough i think, it should cover more materials and it should be harder. "
4575,"Its level increases gradually, the lectures have been explained in a lucid manner and there is a lot to gain from this course"
4576,"I think this was a very well-thought out course. In my opinion, it was well presented, contained very useful information, was accessible to someone with a limited background in cybersecurity, and used plenty of real examples to back-up its claims. An area that could use improvement is testing: some of the quizzes provided questions that seemed hard to follow, particularly the choose "
4577,Interesting topics and some very good case studies. But overall I found the course a little repetitive and lacking technical depth.
4578,"Good introduction to the general security of UX design and experience. Remember this is just the start. Not too technical or difficult, quite easy to be honest. "
4579," Despite not being very fond of areas such as human-computer interaction, I found this course to be well-presented and useful. Definitely a necessity for anyone planning on building secure software. "
4580,"Great course, with really well-explained and interesting classes. A minor problem was the audio issues, but nothing that would hinder your learning."
4581,Informative and the reading material for the week helped a lot 
4582,I like how in depth this gets. it explains it very well an in ways for people who are starting off in this field to get a basic understanding in exactly what we are learning. very well put together! 
4583,"I'm not a cyber professional, but I deal with a lot of security issues just as a part of the job. I'm also researching new hardware methods for cyber security systems. I found aspects of this course to be useful to me. Enjoyed the "
4584,Great course with enriching materials to support. 
4585,"This was an extremely elementary and thus disappointing course. While the importance of Usability was rightly emphasized, the representation in terms of examples, case studies, etc. was simplistic. I appreciated having my attention drawn to the pitfalls of HCI design and the consequent failure of the corresponding systems. However, the solutions were presented as if: 1.) there are always correct interface/usability choices; 2.) the correct choice is all that's needed for the system to be optimally functional; and 3.) there is never a tension between usability and effective functioning of a system (that can't be resolved with correcting the usability). It is irresponsible to suggest, for example, that a user selected memorable password is generally adequately secure without also covering ways that an interface can guide/nudge the user to create a secure password. Wide recognition of the importance of this may be more recent than the studies covered in the course. There is nothing wrong with studying old, seminal research, even in this age of Internet time, but I wish I wasn't left wondering what, if any, developments had occurred in the decade or so since that research took place. As for tension between usability and security, it absolutely exists. For instance, PGP encryption is a reliable way to secure information, yet making it usable remains a challenge. This is not even mentioned in the entire course. In fact, this course would leave an otherwise uninformed student believing that there are usability solutions waiting to be applied to every cause of info insecurity if the techies would just look. I wish the course had at least acknowledged that there are cases where a slight compromise on usability might be necessary for the sake of appropriate security.Lastly, for those designing an HCI for security, it is important to understand threat models. This concept is also missing from the course. === I reviewed this course (above) immediately after I finished it. I am now in the 3rd week of Software Security, the 2nd course in the Cybersecurity specialization, and am realizing that 2 stars was a generous assessment. Based on the prerequisites of the Software Security course, the Usable Security course, in its current form, is too elementary to be appropriate for people who have the experience/knowledge required for the rest of the courses in this specialization. As I explained above, the course relies heavily on decade-old research but does not cover any developments since. For instance, the usability issues covered in the studies are for ancient versions of browsers with no discussion of how the browsers and our infosec vulnerabilities have changed since those studies were published. Another example is the instructor's eschewing of password managers while many knowledgeable folks in the infosec community today recommend their use. The usability challenges of password managers and a discussion of how they might be mitigated would have been more appropriate. "
4586,I really learned so much from this course
4587,Very interesting and a different approach to make security acceptable to users. Currnet technology allow that
4588,Clear and professional!
4589,Very informative! 
4590,A really good course in usable security. A little more of assignments would have been better
4591,"Reasonable class about designing user interfaces, not much about cybersecurity."
4592,I just completed the course. This course is recommended to beginners like me because I learned a new perspective to cyber security. It is exciting to see the psychological aspects in cyber security. I would have given more rating if social engineering is explained too. This is just an introduction to the course and may not be appealing for people already in the field which should be expected anyway.
4593,The concepts are explained in best way so that even the layman can understand it and use it in his daily life and be secured
4594,Extremely practical lessons that can be applied at work immediately.
4595,Very good need more good content like this. 
4596,"Very clear and organized, I will certainly make use of what I learned when writing programs or designing software."
4597,Great course and interesting. 
4598,"iTS Okay. a few things seem a bit hokey. the interviews etc. But overall, not too bad. Good learning points.But will I pay for this. NO. Mainly b/c its hard to translate it in to a tangible value. No employer will say, OH, you took this class. Let me give you a job or promotion or more money..."
4599,"Cours tr??s int??ressant, le professeur parle et articule suffisamment pour ??tre compr??hensible m??me pour quelqu'un qui n'a pas un tr??s bon niveau en Anglais. En plus, il y a les sous titres. Un cours tr??s int??ressant qui vous permettra de prendre un peu de hauteur (ou de recul) par rapport"
4600,"Excellent course, excellent teaching, excellent professor. Thanks."
4601,"Videos with guest speakers were unhelpful. Also, quizzes were not accurate and poorly written questions. "
4602,"very helpful course , and it is help us to improve our knowledge and skills ."
4603,"Thank you! I have learned a lot through the course, in a fun and easy way. "
4604,Muy bueno
4605,"OK, but not really in-depth. Still has useful pointers, but they could be summarized on an A4 sheet."
4606,"This is a course for students with little or no work experience. I've been in the industry for twenty years and found some good information, but the quizes aren't designed for experienced adult learners. Not being able to discuss with the professor why an answer is incorrect or even knowing exactly what about an answer makes it incorrect further distances the students from learning. Given that one essentially spends an extra work day each week on the course, I expected more value for my precious time. This week I decided the value isn't there. I might recommend the course for undergrad students but not for working adults."
4607,"Awesome. I am genuinely exited that I actually took and finished this course. Great content, actionable and at some moments, eye opener.I totally recommend it."
4608,Great course with a easy way yo learn about Usable Security.
4609,Very useful insight about Usability in Security. Advice to everyone interested in Cyber Security.
4610,"Doesnt meet my expectations - it is all about Usable, but not about Security at all."
4611,"Very informative, easy to understand and gives a clear understanding about the overall concept on usable security."
4612,Excellent and useful lecture
4613,"The entirety of this course can be taught in a few sentences. If there is too great a sacrifice to productivity for the sake of security, then people will find a way around any security mechanisms in place. If something is difficult to use, then people will likely not use it. "
4614,I missed more pratical exercises about it.
4615,Gives different perspective on the Cyber Security field.
4616,thanks
4617,Excellent explanation with very nice examples.
4618,Excellent course. Learned a lot about usable security.
4619,the best one
4620,Great course. It opened my mind in a few aspects of day to day privacy and security aspects people tend to ignore.
4621,It's a good course
4622,It was very interesting course! Thank you.
4623,Excellent course filled with plenty of info to get you started thinking about usable security.
4624,"This course really brings security and privacy to life. It connects the technically detailed 'how' of the other courses (cryptography, software and hardware security) with the why. More importantly it helps us make informed choices when designing, and helps us identify the real options."
4625,"Great course, I loved the examples and video of practices throughout the learning!"
4626,A very fascinating and enjoyable course! I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to take the first step in learning about cybersecurity.
4627,"I found this course very interesting. Even if I already have some knowledge of security in general, I was very happy to follow this course and go in details about all aspect of usable security. Lessons are very clear and easy to understand. I will go forward with other security courses."
4628,"Very interesting course, good material"
4629,great
4630,I learned the psychology of implementing security systems.
4631,"Excellent course, well explained. Not too much things to learn at once. Ideal when you want to start. Would be useful to have also a slide deck next to it for the review and exam preparation."
4632,Liked the structure of the course and the way concepts have been integrated with real life practical examples. Would have loved to understand some examples or references to 'design thinking' consideration of some specific industry problems - like building a payments system or a ticketing system etc.
4633,"There are many parts of the lectures that are very quiet and even with my speakers turned to max, I struggled to hear, while other parts were clear. The course is interesting, but I doubt that anyone would pay to attend this course."
4634,"Aprendi a conciliar as necessidades dos usu??rios e os requisitos de Seguran??a da Informa????o, tornando o sistema mais seguro, eficiente, simples e satisfat??rio."
4635,"I strongly recommend this course to all security software developers, managers and of course to designers."
4636,"Very good, excellent course"
4637, Cool ! 
4638,Thanks for the course. it's very useful for my present job :). 
4639,"would be nice if you could see the questions and answers after you take a quiz or exam, that way its easier to lean where you went wrong on a question."
4640,Nice course with more important info
4641,thanks alot

4712,"Very clear and organized, I will certainly make use of what I learned when writing programs or designing software."
4713,Great course and interesting. 
4714,"iTS Okay. a few things seem a bit hokey. the interviews etc. But overall, not too bad. Good learning points.But will I pay for this. NO. Mainly b/c its hard to translate it in to a tangible value. No employer will say, OH, you took this class. Let me give you a job or promotion or more money..."
4715,"Cours tr??s int??ressant, le professeur parle et articule suffisamment pour ??tre compr??hensible m??me pour quelqu'un qui n'a pas un tr??s bon niveau en Anglais. En plus, il y a les sous titres. Un cours tr??s int??ressant qui vous permettra de prendre un peu de hauteur (ou de recul) par rapport"
4716,"Excellent course, excellent teaching, excellent professor. Thanks."
4717,"Videos with guest speakers were unhelpful. Also, quizzes were not accurate and poorly written questions. "
4718,"very helpful course , and it is help us to improve our knowledge and skills ."
4719,"Thank you! I have learned a lot through the course, in a fun and easy way. "
4720,"OK, but not really in-depth. Still has useful pointers, but they could be summarized on an A4 sheet."
4721,"Awesome. I am genuinely exited that I actually took and finished this course. Great content, actionable and at some moments, eye opener.I totally recommend it."
4722,Great course with a easy way yo learn about Usable Security.
4723,Excellent and useful lecture
4724,good course with great instructor
4725,Definitely liked it. Tons of useful information. Strongly recommend to everyone who wants to learn Bootstrap.
4726,Very Good Tutorial. Very good platform to learn more in web development.
4727,Great instructor. 
4728,"Thank to Mr Muppala for clear,understandable and also joyful lesson. Recommend to all people who wants to improve themselves about these issues."
4729,great class
4730,Awesome course for web developers.
4731,"Very well crafted course, it emphasizes why Bootstrap its such a popular web-dev language nowadays, its quite easy to understand and quite pleasant to see and use, also made clear by such an outstanding teacher, i wholeheartedly recommend this course and good luck if you get it."
4732,Good course!
4733,"Great course, I learned a lot."
4734,"Soooooooo boring. I actually use Bootstrap in my job on occasion, but I've never learned it properly. This course was so disorganized. The cuts to questions happened sometimes mid thought, and the questions weren't thoughtful or graded. So fairly pointless. The exercises were presented without context and then you foud out the directions were placed AFTER the video walk through... How? And there's also the issue of basically just duplicating the code that is hastily presented (sometimes) with no actual thought. Just copy and paste the whole thing. That's not teaching or learning. I am sensitive to the fact that the professor's native language isn't English, but it was very challenging to listen to his speech pattern and inflection for 20 minute videos. My goodness, edit!! There was no reason for them to be so long and so full of filler. The exercises weren't clear, and I found that the reviews I received were split. In other words, other students weren't sure what they should be doing on the exercises either. I've never done peer-reviewed assignments before, and I don't think I'll do them again.I found the professor in the first course informative. I learned things about HTML, CSS, and JS that I thought I already knew. The exercises were challenging but attainable. If he was the professor for this entire specialization, I would stick it out. But I literally dread listening to the rest of this course let alone 5 more courses of this guy droning on while jumping around the code not explaining things clearly or (oddly enough) slowly enough. Canceling my membership early and looking for a better course elsewhere. Yikes."
4735,really great professor !!
4736,Nice Course content..And Best Teachers...Thank you coursera to help me to learn Bootstrap
4737,"Great course about bootrap, it explains all the basics"
4738,Great Course!
4739,A must guide for any one willing to understand from scratch and take some challenges on web design these days
4740,Nice course for fundamentals of bootstrap!!
4741,"The course is super good, and easy to follow, "
4742,"The explanation is lengthy,there are short pauses in between and the way he explain is not really that clear. It is also hard for us to grade the assignment. "
4743,Great course. Working with doing is best method for learning.
4744, Excellent instructor with a sense of humor. Nicely organized course. - Iftekhar 
4745,Thank you a very much for this.
4746,"Very informative and fun approach to the Bootstrap framework, thank you to Dr. Mappala and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for making this class available to everybody through Coursera."
4747,nice one
4748,Great Learning
4749,Excelente
4750,I took great advantage of this course
4751,Excellent instructor.
4752,Thank you.
4753,Overall is Ok. It gives you a grasp of the technology but do not expect to become an expert in Bootstrap or jQuery after this course. You still have to learn &amp; practice a lot. 
4754,Very Good
4755,"Focuses on Bootstrap responsive design and Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. You will learn to create professional looking and responsive web pages. Also there is introduction to some web tools including node.js, NPM (node package manager) and Bower. Highly recommend this course to anyone learning front-end web dev. Great course. Great Instructor. "
4756,Great course to introduce you to developing using bootstrap framework
4757,"It is very good. The teacher is full of positive energy and his efforts to make us learn is amazing. The assignments are not difficult as with enough attention during the lessons, you can do them with a bit of effort. Highly recommended."
4758,this is great course
4759,"Thanks all for this greate course, I want to give special thank to our teacher Mr Jogesh K. Muppala."
4760,"I really enjoyed learning about Bootstraps data- attributes as well as Node.js, Bower &amp; Git. This stuff used to be a mystery to me but this course clarified it for me."
4761,The delivery of the subject matter was practical and hands on. It builds confidence for new developers and provides exercises which enables a newbie to be develop self proficiency and effectiveness by researching.
4762,Excellent course
4763,Excellent course! A must.
4764,Super! Very valuable experience with Bootstrap!
4765,"Nice,i think bootstrap not too hard to understand."
4766,"Awesome Course , with a lot of details and great information also ... thanks to coursera they always bring to us a great value of knowledge "
4767,It is a great course. Detailed information in this course about Bootstrap has helped me a lot.
4768,I found the material was good and the instructor was engaging. I appreciate that he tries to make learning hands on. Overall I found this a great introduction to Bootstrap. My only criticism is that at times I felt like I was only copying and pasting code rather than really learning the material. I ended up copying and pasting plenty of tags that are never really mentioned or explained. 
4769,Very Good Experience
4770,"Good one to start with. Even though it is just basics, but a good foundation."
4771,This course is really good for anyone who has basic knowledge of any programming language. this will help you to connect dots on how web programming is done for companies and how tools are used to expedite your coding.
4772,Perfect.
4773,great course and the entire specialization is superb
4774,"this course in an excellent course , the instructors are well trained and excellent in programing. If i get children I will think a way of sending them to Hong kong to study this university "
4775,"It was a really good course. Some negative comments say things about the instructor speaking slow or do not liking the way exercises are donde (following the video). The instructor is clearly a non-native english speaker so it is normal that he does not speak it the way most are used to, but you can set the reproduction rate to a higher one.Everything else was just perfect and I really learned a lot."
4776,I learned a lot in this course. The instructor was clear.
4777,Good Course
4778,Excellent course on Bootstrap and responsive web design. Concepts well explained with plenty of good examples. You will definitely learn Bootstrap once you finish this course.
4779,"great course, rich in vital information for new developers"
4780,"This course is excellent, and comprehensive."
4781,Great course
4782,Awesome Course
4783,"A very good course that introduces important topics, tools and techniques"
4784,The course is excellent.The professor is very clear and presents many concepts and resources usefuls.
4785,Great course! Really complete To who is going to do it: Read the additional resources always! These are really useful
4786,Excellent course!
4787,GOOD!!
4788,"A lot of people says the course is boring because of the instructor but, for me he his doing well and i quite grab a lot from him things i didn't catch up before in previous Bootstrap course i took. his pace is perfectly ok and i had no problem with accent or something. I give him 5 stars"
4789,Loved it
4790,Good Course Work!! Very Good Faculty!!
4791,Cursos excelente. Aprendi muito de bootstrap e front end com este curso.
4792,Lecturer is too boring and volume is too low. 
4793,The only problem on this journey with Jogesh sir is that it seems like I have got to know his quirkiness so well that he feels like someone I would love to know personally but can't! I enjoy the way he seems to simplify concepts and bring them together in the end to make even the most difficult concept seem entirely simple.
4794,"Great course, well designed, everything is great, but there's always a room for improvement. may be more excercises will help improve it"
4795,"Really great! The materials, exercises and assignments. I would defiantly recommend someone to do this. One will have a great appreciation for bootstrap and the tools covered in this course."
4796,Very interesting.
4797,Excellent course for boot-strap
4798,So Userfull and funny course. it's very good if you want to leard front web UI developer.
4799,"This course was awesome! The mentor taught all the topics with such great ease and in the correct order. Not only the coding part was given value, its implications were also kept in mind. I would like to recommend this course to enhance your front-end skills. This course gives you whatever it has promised. Do check this course :)"
4800,Excellent lecturer. Gained a deeper insight into Bootstrap.
4801,Great course!
4802,"Very good course to take, the instructor will walk step by step through the course. Although is one course but gives you lots of components needed to be a good front-end developer. Some people saying in their comments that the course or the instructor is boring, but I'm telling you from my experience this course is worth to take it and to be frank no course is easy or sweet no matter who teach just be patient and you will learn. Thanks "
4803,The accent and rhythm of Jogesh makes it difficult to follow the course.There is no extra information in addition to the presentation. The teacher is only reading the slides which makes the experience quite limited/boring.The content is enough to get an idea of Bootstrap basic functionality.
4804,Great and smooth
4805,Excellent Course to learn Responsive web design
4806,Excellent
4807,Good course 
4808,fantastic Course !
4809," This course is a whoa!!! I recommend it for every new comer to bootstrap. I love the way the instructor (Jogesh K Muppala) took the course. Very simple to understand, well explained, very brief with nice practice exercise. Thanks for making the course available. I learnt a lot from it "
4810,The lecturer's narration is a little embarrassing... 
4811,great course with a lot of useful content. Bootstrap and Bower are very powerful tools!

4830,Great Course with a great prof who makes great jokes
4831,Great Course.
4832,A nice and complete course about front-end Frameworks. 
4833,Nice course on Bootstrap. From an entry level to a fairly advanced in just four pretty intensive weeks.
4834,love it. the best ever
4835,It's great and full of useful information
4836,Good introduction of front-end web frameworks &amp; tools.
4837,"Very Nice course. I have gained some confidence in Bootstrap now. I will like to Thank, Prof. Muppala for his hard effort for us students. Thank you Sir."
4838,comprehensively teaches the topics and impressed with it 
4839,Really good course for those who want to learn more about Bootstrap and basic stuff about front-end technologies.
4840,it was a good course. but it was super boring as hellthat's why I didn't continue learning the other modulesmost of coursera's courses as boring but this was the most boring
4841,Very nice! Some things I felt that went too fast but in general it was great!
4842,"The assignment instructions weren't clear and when uploading the assignment files, the pages didn't render properly. This also was a problem during peer review of assignments."
4843,Excellent course!
4844,"Absolutely great course, I learned a lot."
4845,Very useful course! I learned a lot and can't wait to learn more from the next course! Thanks
4846," Excellent course! It gave me an excellent introduction to a wide range of bootstrap components. I learned how to use bootstrap and its CSS clases and JavaScript components in my site, how to use bower to manage my project's dependencies, how to make some very basic functions using JQuery and how to use Less and Sass to preprocess my Stylesheets in a more handy way. I loved this course, because even when it seems to be very basic, i feel la I know a lot about this technologies i've learned. This is a must if you're new to bootstrap or some Web Development tools based on nodejs like Bower, Sass or Less "
4847,A great course to learn about bootstrap if you are a beginner. 
4848,Awesome course indeed. I bet these courses are more credible than the degree courses which we follow at most of the universities.
4849,Nice Course
4850,Very good
4851,Good
4852,Excellent course!
4853,Great course to understand responsive design and to take a nice and deep start up with bootstrap framework! 
4854,Excellent course. The content is well organized. It has a short task after each module. It helps a lot to understand every part of the course. I highly recommend it!!!
4855,very good course. I add this comment when I review this course :)
4856,"It's the very good course, the professor has a incridible form to explain."
4857,Needs more practical examples.Like project for free.
4858,Thanks for this opportunity!
4859,Good and Informative
4860,"I was able to learn Bootstrap effectively from this course. The assignments were good practise. However, reviewing other peoples assignments was a bit annoying, as their files had to be downloaded and put opened in a browser and it was a bit of as tedious process. The teaching style was good. "
4861,good
4862,"The assignment instructions and grading criteria are unclear/incomplete. Because of this, given these are peer graded assignments, it is likely to lose marks because the peers interpreted the instructions differently. Some of the topics covered in the lectures are not covered in the assignments, while other topics which are not covered are. All assignments build upon the code written in the exercises in all previous weeks, so there is no way to know if you are starting off with correct code. The lecture videos contain a lot of code examples, but the various key notions covered are not explained and the assumption seems to be you will look those up in the API. Sometimes the code examples in the slides contain mistakes. It sometimes felt like the content covered in the videos could have been delivered in a much shorter time."
4863,Very well delivered. I do believe however that the peer review may sometimes let certain details slip through and as a result the learning experience might be not as good as it could be.
4864,"Good, if basic, intro to frameworks and tools."
4865,It is an awsome course. 
4866,Very very helpful course! The instructor speed slowly and I can listen the course clearly! Thank you!
4867,Excellent Course
4868,good instructions
4869,I feel like the Bootstrap content was very well presented. It was easy for me to understand and I had no major problems with assignments after watching all the materials and doing excersies along the way. 
4870,"Easy, but learned a lot."
4871,A good course to getting used to how things work and being briefly exposed to the tools available.
4872,This is very good course about ui frameworks and tools
4873,"Good Teaching method! professor teaches very nicely!, Easy to learn!Thank you.Team: Couresera"
4874,It is always fun learning in Coursera! Professor Muppala made it even more interesting.Thank you sir!I feel more hands on assignments to have a better understanding will be more exciting .
4875,"It was an excellent journey on Bootstrap. The instructor, Mr Jogesh was really helpful in taking us through the course giving a strong insight into the bootstrap world. This course has given me a confidence in building a responsive website UI ahead. Hoping to enhance the knowledge in the coming courses in the specialization and build a strong career as Web dev.Thank You, Sir!"
4876,Good for to get knowledge in web tools.
4877,"It'a really good course, well explained.My only observation would be that it's really frustrating that you cannot submit your work, just because you didn't payed for the course."
4878,I loved the exercises and the way the process was centered on making the learner practice and take action!
4879,"two stars because I really suffered during this course .I didn't like the instructor behavior of explaining the topics he represents. First of all I didn't like the idea of building over one website, if you didn't get what was happening so you already ruined a part of the total website which you will continue building over during the whole coursesecond the assignments requirements requires additional searches which wasn't explained in details during the session third the explanation is so boring and you can easily lose your concentration because of poor communication skills forth the assignments requires two many details really, Also I need to get the code of other classmates using get source code option on my google chrome and then run it again , there are much efficient ways to handle that like running the delivered assignment directly on the server "
4880,"It's always tricky to create a course on a framework, since it's always updating itself, but this is a solid base if you think you can't manage to learn everything on your own and need a place to start. After this you'll be familiar with the concept of UI frameworks and therefore will be easier to learn them in the future."
4881,Great course for learning and understanding Bootstrap.
4882,Great Course
4883,the instructor is really amazing :)
4884,"Professor Muppala thank you, you really taught me a lot"
4885,Good
4886,Great introduction to Bootstrap and LESS. Assignments are practical and build on each other.
4887,Nice approach!
4888,Great course!
4889,I don't like the teacher
4890,This course is good and simple with explanation and i prefer anyone to take it because it is useful
4891,I was a really good course. However some of the assignment tasks could have been a bit more complex (For example week 4).
4892,Excellent course with good challenging assignments. It improves our understanding in designing complex webpages in a smooth and easier way. Recommended for everyone who are wishing to grow as a web developer.
4893,In this course we can learn about the fundamentals of front-end web development and some useful tools. 
4894,This course is a must for students / professional who are passionate about Web development. Provides a good understanding of skills that are required for one to succeed. 
4895,awesome course with very good practice but explanation need to be more enthusiastic
4896,Simply awesome I really like the teacher. 
4897,"Great course on bootstrap, after it you will have no problem creating a beautiful static webpage"
4898,"Pretty decent breakdown of Bootstrap, but execution can be poor with the assignments. For example, one of the end-chapter assignments is missing complete instructions, and enough digging in the forums refers to, a screenshot of the complete instructions. Rather unacceptable for a peer-reviewed course, okay for a free, self-auditing run."
4899,Great course..
4900,"Great course! For a beginner, it integrates basic concepts and wonderful practices, so that I got the knowledge and practical skills to build a beautiful and attractive web-pages. Also, it provides a broaden view of the techs in the web-development area. Thank you all the staff!"
4901,it is super :) 
4902,thx
4903,Good
4904,very good
4905,All around great platform to learn on
4906,"very powerful, covered a lot of topics and explain it very well, i gained a lot of experience from it and i recommend it to any junior in web development track."
4907,Wonderful!
4908,Nice Explanation.... 
4909,"In the end of this course, I acquired strong basic knowledge for continue using bootstrap UI FW in real tasks. Explanation of lessons was informative, easy for understanding, and sufficiently deeply."
4910,Professionally handled course that is easy to understand and teaches you a lot!
4911,Good :)
4912,Great flow and spirits. I appreciate your crack at jokes :) keep up the great work prof!
4913,Awesome course !!A must for those interested in easy UI development of website using bootstrap.
4914,Excellent course! It was a very good experience. In recommend everyone this course in order to improve your skills.
4915,Very good introduction for bootstrap
4916,"I think this course was way too ambitious. It's neat to imagine learning all of this stuff in four weeks, but one should be realistic. Sure, we had lectures explaining things, but in the end we mostly had to copy-and-paste code and confirm that it worked. There should have been many, many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understanding.Perhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate. To really understand and absorb this stuff, I'll need to spend a lot of time with the additional resources. The lectures and scaffolded exercises certainly exposed us to a lot, but it would be hard to say I really learned very much."
4917,Very basic course. It's not worth it 70$
4918,Great course!
4919,I can't stress enough how much my view towards front end development changed after taking this course. And have never stopped using the tools that I learnt here.
4920,I reminds me what I did to my previous company. It is like a brush up and the instructor is good in delivering the content.
4921,Excellent course.
4922,"I learn so much, thank you very much."
4923,Very good info about using Bootstrap! 
4924,Great way to get the basic knowledge about main tools
4925,I found excellent with Practical examples and assimilation As gradual Learning .
4926,good
4927,good
4928,Great course
4929,Good explanation. And good exercise. The exercise help me a lot to make a knowledge more clear.
4930,good course.
4931,"Thank you! Some of the exercises were not that well explained, but with the help of the forum everything was doable."
4932,Good course and assignments!
4933,Very good course and the professor is very nice!
4934,The course content was very informative and straight to the point. 
4935,It's a great course. It covers everything in a very easy-to-understand manner. Also the mentors are great.
4936,The Best course to introduce anyone to boostrap with topics that most tutorials/lectures don't cover. 
4937,Great course
4938,"wonderful course well structured learning material .Any one interested in web Development must do this course.Thank you ,Sir for teaching and providing us such a informative course ."
4939,Very Good Course
4940,Good .-.
4941,thanks i like the assignment really :)
4942,Great course and also great teacher
4943,The sound doesn't turn up very loud.
4944,Great teacher and great course!
4945,A nice course. Just learning a lot.
4946,Good lecture for knowing Bootstrap! 
4947,"Simply Perfect, Clear and fully understandable "
4948,"Excelente Curso, muy didactvo"
4949,Comprehensive guide to bootstrap
4950,"Course content is good, however instructions for the assignments are not complete. Often, instructions for the assignments that are required in the grading criteria are buried in the discussion forums, sometimes in multiple threads. And the method of grading is also only explained in the discussion forum. This can lead to the peer review grades being difficult to assign. The assignment pages should be updated to properly include ALL requirements and an explanation of how to grade the assignment."
4951,very good
4952,Very nice course
4953,"Well done! I liked that the exercises provided less and less instruction but were definitely do-able with a little research, just like real life. Highly recommend!"
4954,good
4955,Good 
4956,good course
4957,Really good course to learn Bootstrap!
4958,Thanks You
4959,"The course is good. It helps have clarity around Bootstrap elements, and covers basics on things like Less and Sass. At the end you will not be a super expert, but you will be able to understand how to build a basic webpage and how to use support elements like less, sass, and package management tools. "
4960,good
4961,"Fantastic course , well taught and explained with great examples."
4962,This is interesting
4963,Great and giving - i can now apply my newly achieved knowledge into my daily work. 
4964,"It is amazing how we learn on Coursera courses. We have build a solid atarting point on Bootstrap framework, understanding the main classes. We are already able to build something real web design."
4965,A very interesting course and a good overview of Bootstrap. The teacher's style helps a lot to grab new concepts.
4966,Challenging and fun
4967,"I like most of them, but I think it is kind of too many contents"
4968,Good professional advices. Much more than a simple tutorial.
4969,this course one of the most fantastic courses i take
4970,very clear and organized course
4971,great to understand basics of Bootstrap
4972,Very nice tutorial for starters. Includes all the necessary documentation needed and the exercises are very well planned such that they cover all the concepts. Highly engaging tutor. Strongly recommend!
4973,"I don't recommend this class. Jogesh K. Muppala has very labored English and his pace and verbosity make the lectures hard to get through. I've turned in around 10 assignments and have yet to get a grade on anything. The course content is poorly organized and executed. Peer grading is just dumb (and clearly doesn't work, since I have yet to get a single assignment back). When you turn in assignment files, they cannot be opened (and we found out from an apparent student how to get past the technical issues). Questions about the class and submitting assignments went unanswered. My advice, save your money and don't take this class."
4974,I loved this course. While this course will not make you an expert with Bootstrap it will however take you up to a level where you're able to learn on your own and actually understand why is something happening when it's happening.
4975,"Good course, i liked the exercises. It is well explained, but you also need to learn/read from other sites (what is linked as resource), to be able to do the weekly tasks. I liked this approach, the teacher is explaining the lectures well."
4976,"Excellent professor, excellent material, excelent course! :)"
4977,Very nice method to teach the basics of bootstrap frameworks. I recommend this course!
4978,"Excellent for absolute beginners! But, if you have good experience in CSS &amp; JavaScript you might play it at 1.5X, it is too informative to be attended by someone who knows even a little, it might be boring, then.Generally, the course is very informative, rich, instructions based and have very good exercises covering all the course content with a good-as-a-start hands on experience."
4979," This course will be very help for me in my masters track. Since I am doing master in this field so I want to study all the topic in more detail. Furthermore, the course is helpful for me in my career development. "
4980,"Great course , great teaching style and content :)Loved the course."
4981, Really good course on Bootstrap and Responsive design.
4982,"I think the course, while well laid out content-wise, is poorly executed. I'm thankful I audited the course. I would have been upset had I paid for it. Still, even the free access permits you to use all of the materials minus the major graded assignments. I struggled getting any styling to work with my CSS (files that was provided by the teacher) in conjunction with my Bootstrap. I was unable to replicate what he presented throughout the project (figuring it out on my own after-the-fact), as he would jump ahead in sections while verbally NOT visually detailing what he would be doing next. I was lost for a while. When I managed to correct where he'd left me in the dark, I found that my class assignments failed to override the bootstrap defaults. I didn't get much help when I asked if he had altered the bs files or changed his specificity in order to get them to work. Overall - I'd give the class a C+. I did learn a few things that filled in the gaps with responsive websites, but the tutorials were ultimately not very helpful. "
4983,Brilliant bootstrap. Strap on your boots and be prepared for a journey into the inner workings of Bootstrap (shamelessly 'borrowed' this pun from the course).
4984,"Found all the lessons very well explained. The exercises were clear and helped a lot to put all in action.The shared PDF's are a good guide. About the videos It seems to me a challenge to put many concepts in short ones, less than 10min of duration. I am very satisfied, even some videos could be considered too long. ;-)"
4985,Maybe the best first contact with bootstrap for any web developer 
4986,"Great course for beginners in Bootstrap, like myself."
4987,excellent!
4988,Nice course ;)
4989,Learned a lot!
4990,Very well explained! Details hand on exercises that help a lot understanding the subjects 
4991,"muy buen curso, cconciso y el profesor afable y conocedor del tema"
4992,Great!
4993,Excellent course.
4994,vraiment satisfait
4995,It is very good course and very much useful for us.
4996,"nice course, nice way of teaching by giving the assigments after the practice on exercises."
4997,Very Good Course for begineers
4998,great
4999,Awesome!
5000,Amazing course with great knowledge of UI Frameworks and its components. 
5001,Excellent!
5002,Good teaching method
5003,The course offers good material and covers the minimum requirements of bootstrap. The additional resources provided by the instructor are great for futher reading. The problem is the instructor delivers the material in an organized way but he is very slow. 
5004,Best Courser for beginner
5005,Nice course!!! 
5006,Excelent
5007,"The course proposal is very good, but the material and the examples need to be improved."
5008,"As a beginner, this cours is greate "
5009,"I really liked that, I never coded anything with Bootstrap and it was awesome. Now I'm prepared and ready to go ahead with Angular Course."
5010,The instructor is great and super funny.
5011,Very well explained !!
5012,Excellent!
5013,This course is really useful for beginners like me. But. sometimes i feel like fast forwarding the course. It was too slow in the middle.
5014,Good basic course
5015,The student is carefully led into the vast language of Front-End coding with easy-to-follow videos and exercise instructions.
5016,Love it so far. The lesson exercises make everything easy to learn and not boring. 
5017,Very useful course. Professor explained material in a nice and interesting way.
5018,"I think the classes and the exercises could be far more dynamic and didactic, but besides of that is a good course to get a grip of Bootstrap if you follow along writing the code and if you tinker a little by yourself afterwards. But it's definitely for people with solid JS and CSS bases."
5019,Nice course!
5020,Good
5021,"It is too hard to understand what he is saying, his accent is impossible to follow. Besides, the lectures are not dynamic, it is just him reading the slides with the most monotonous and boring voice ever. I took the first course of the specialization with David and this is the complete opposite. I would love to see the whole 5 courses with David and not only the first one."
5022,I can beat my chest and say I know bootstrap it was an awesome experience... I was taught well which is a whole lot better than self learning/teaching which leaves a you with a whole lot of unknown information about the subject.
5023,"Straight to the point, very explanatory ....Made learning easy and fun."
5024,"My frst Certificated Courera Course.I took about 12 hours to finish it.I think this Course is a 5-star-course, and maybe the best Bootstrap MOOC course on Internet;The curriculum is set reasonably,I believe with this course finished ,you will have a solid grasp of bootstrap,and know how to build enterprise Web UI.what's more,the Professor is very kind and with a sense of humor."
5025,Great Bootstrap usage and explanation of classes in the framework. 
5026,great course!
5027,i'm really glad i took this course most especially when it comes to bower et al. Really really glad for the opportunity. thank you
5028,Thank you for this course. I learned so much on this course. It has encouraged to not give up on this new career of web development I have started
5029,Great course for people who start creating web application. Great exercises and assignments. Thank you very much.
5030,"Wonderful course, well designed content, exercise and assignment. Only that difficulties of the assignment could be improved so as to ensure bette learning. We want more challenge! lol "
5031,"good course with clear explanation, thank you "
5032,It's a good course where I come across bower and CSS how to use the function for the UI frameworks.
5033,Excelent course!
5034,Excellent for bootstrap beginners
5035,"I have learned many thing by attending the class, which is good for helping me find a job."
5036,Easy way to understand and assignments covers the most important parts in every week . 
5037,"Clear explanations,exercises are very detailed and contain sufficient complexity to make them useful."
5038,Extremely practical! Thank you 
5039,Buen curso para aprender lo mas importante de bootstrap y tener una idea basica de herramientas como node.js y bower. Lo recomiendo mas que nada a la gente que quiera aprender sobre bootstrap.
5040,Excellent!!! Learning so much! Recommend to beginners!
5041,really good
5042,"this is a good course to get started on front-end web frameworks , and the teaching was very good ."
5043,"nice course and good instructor. but talks too slow, I completed whole course at audio speed x1.5."
5044, Well designed and informative! 
5045,"For all the many courses I took on Coursera, this course is one of the best."
5046,"Before , I have heard alot about Bootstrap in jobs requirements , from my class mates and so on ... I don't know why I didn't have enough courage to start learning Bootstrap by myself .... after completing this course .. I can consider myself good at using the power of Bootstrap ... this course gives me a strong push towards enrolling Web world and diving deeper and learning more ... thanks Coursera thanks Honk Kong University thanks Dr. Jogesh K. Muppala"
5047,"I would like to express my gratitude to prof. Muppala for this incredible course.There are indeed many great resources for learning any of the technologies and tools used in this course and specialization. But what is unique about this specialization, is that it gives us not only solid foundations needed to use these tools, but, just as importantly, a clear context as to where a certain tool or its segment is used. Sure enough, having in mind the broader context, it is much easier to understand all of the segments individually.I would also like to thank Kre??imir and all the other mentors that helped make this course a pleasant experience.I can't wait for the next course on Angular JS to start!"
5048,excelent
5049,This course can be a bit dry at times. But still very informative
5050,awesome course... 
5051,Good course with great teacher
5052,Great intro to bootstrap. I feel like more bootstrap features and web tools could have been covered. 
5053,Good class. Lots of fun.
5054,Very good
5055, One of the best on coursera.. tons of praise for the professor. 
5056,"This class teaches you the essentials of Bootstrap v3. It is by no means a complete course on Bootstrap, but it will teach you how to use the main components effectively."
5057,"The full course should be available to everybody with the assignments, only the certificate should be given to those who have paid for the course."
5058,"If you're expecting a decent tutorial on Bootstrap, this is the course for you. If you're expecting a course on fundamental UI design and implementation concepts, you might be a little disappointed. Overall, well presented with a fun restaurant mock web site as the final project."
5059,"Excellent course. Well taught by Prof. Muppala. Instructor has covered all key points of Bootstrap. Towards the end, he is appropriately introduced node.js and bower. His restaurant example is very appropriate for the course contents and builds continuity through out the course. "
5060,Last assignment does not have full instructions on how to complete it. Otherwise a good course.
5061,Really nice
5062, best tutorial for bootstrap. 
5063,I enjoyed the course. Not a difficult course but the course experience was great. Instructor was also really good at explaining concepts.
5064,helps to know every section of bootstrap
5065,Awesome!!!
5066,Well structured and informative.
5067,Now for me bootstrap is more clear.
5068,"Very interesting, actual material and good teacher."
5069,Perfect Bootstrap learning course.
5070,NICE EXPERIANCE
5071,Excellent Course!
5072,Great Courses!
5073,very good ! This course help me a lot. Really appreciate ! 
5074,Great!
5075,"Valuable and very well organized, I found it quite simple"
5076,This course is great if you are looking for learning responsive web designing using Twitter Bootstrap. Lot of areas are covered in this single course along.
5077,Thank you!
5078,"I enjoyed this course and felt it to be a good introduction to Bootstrap.The time allocations were not realistic, though. I have a fairly strong (albeit outdated) background in programming and web design, but I still felt that I spent a lot more more time than what was allocated for learning. I imagine that this can be very discouraging to beginners. I am looking forward to the remaining modules. "
5079,Very useful course
5080,"Enjoyed the course!I learned bootstrap before from codeschool, but it wasn't as good as this course!"
5081,"The topic is overall well covered.The material are not easy to go through and do not reference well key knowledge area, specifically: how to apply them.The exercises and the assignments could be largely improved: the targets and the guidance are not always clear. Adding up on the same files instead having one file per exercice / one learning key point does not help."
5082,Great and easy step by step bootstrap course 
5083,"I would recommend reading the docs on the bootstraps website, this course doesn't add much value to just the normal bootstrap docs"
5084,"This bootstrap course is very nice , every components are explained nicely. Assignments also good. Waiting for next angular js lecture "
5085,Excellent!!!
5086,Great course. So detailed and has so many practical tasks. Definitely recommend! 
5087,Good Course
5088,It is a very useful course
5089,Nice Course!!
5090,Well Organized and very instructive. Thanks.
5091,"helping me lot, thanks"
5092,Excelent!
5093,"I really enjoyed the course, it was taught well and i had fun learning about bootstrap."
5094,Very good course for programmers new to this area. Course is prepared very well. It was very useful for me. Thanks
5095,Nice course.Recommend this one as an introduction into Bootstrap/Angular
5096,Cool
5097,Excellent course. Every week the professor made an incredible effort to make it easy. I highly recommend it.
5098,Interesting topic for easy website building 
5099,Very well organized and linked.
5100,Nice class
5101,Excelent course. The teacher is amazing and the course content is great!!!
5102,Nice lecture and good for starter to learn
5103,"Such a good tutorial for beginner,Thank you so much for this. "
5104,This course gave me the fundamentals to start with the development of responsive web sites. The learning process is well supported with some exercises for each reviewed topic.
5105,"I audited this course and did the assignments independently.This course focuses on examining Bootstrap's CSS and Javascript components in much detail. Towards the end one is introduced to NPM and Bower.Concepts are explained through a project. Nearly all major components of Bootstrap were covered, many of which are often ignored in other courses I have taken. The course materials (the slides) are very well made. I like the pace at which this course goes and the instructors are very active and helpful on the discussion forums. "
5106,This was a four star course and the links to additional information were a good resource. 3 stars for the discussions which were left unanswered much of the time and not a highly active mentor group. Much was left to student when stuck and exasperated options.
5107,Excelente curso. Muchas gracias por brindarme la oportunidad de ser parte de ??l.
5108,Thorough introduction into Bootstrap. I especially liked the hands-on exercises!
5109,Nice and clear.
5110,"Good course. The assignments are a bit too easy since they give the code in the assignment details basically, but still the course gives a good introduction to bootstrap and other web frameworks and tools. "
5111,Explanation from scratch! Just Brilliant!
5112,"Excellent instructor. Good content, and very good explanations. Very good additional resources."
5113,best course...
5114,Good informative course for starters on bootstrap.
5115,"Good Course ,Good content for Bootstrap."
5116,Very good!
5117,Exceptional Tutorial... This is really a nice tutorial. Well presented and explained. Practical activity is too good. Thanks 
5118,This course was an excellent introduction into Bootstrap. It was very useful to me. The instructor was very knowledgeable and presented the subject in a very intuitive and logic manner.
5119,Awesome Course (y) Must for all beginners!!!!
5120,watching the videos with speed 1.5 is optimal
5121,Recomendado
5122,Great information and structure to this course. Easy to follow along and understand the concepts. I would not be able to do the same thing just by surfing the net. 
5123,It is easy to start coding using the Bootstrap. This course provides most useful components of Bootstrap library and uses a real project to apply css and js libraries.
5124,"A large portion of the course is just copy and pasting code that is provided to you. While the code that is pasted is explained, and a lot of content is covered as a result of not having to write it, I feel my overall retention is much lower than in other courses."
5125,Overall a good course
5126,Good
5127,The course is good. Gives a brief overview of Javascript. 
5128,"The course is good. I already use Bootstrap and still finding useful information here. But the sound is too silent. Also teacher speaks too slow, it makes listening even more difficult."
5129,Joggesh is a great instructor. He is very thorough in his lectures and his presentations.
5130,Thanks for this course it is very useful.
5131,As Interesting as funny &amp; useful
5132,Its been an interesting course
5133,Great Course!!
5134,Nice materials and trainers. Very useful
5135,"Enjoyed course. Wish the review questions didn't include 'ands ' (both had to be right for a 'Yes' and pts) . With many ways to solve problems, these 2-part questions didn't always fit. Sometimes a peer had one exactly and then did the other part a different way that worked just fine. They make it harder to grade people. In most cases, if it worked I said it was good-to-go."
5136,Great
5137,This course was very informative and assignments were very good.trainer was clear and good.
5138,strongly recommend!
5139,"A informative class with a great instructor. Teaching is mostly through videos but their are exercises each day as well, which I appreciate (I'm a hands on kind of learner). The assignments at the end of the week are challenging in that they usually ask you to learn something from a 3rd part website or take what you know and combine it in ways he hasn't shown you. While that might be difficult for some I find it refreshing. By the end I feel that I know the breadth of bootstrap and have decent skills to implement basic websites with it."
5140,good.
5141,"I'm enjoying this course. Material and themes covered by professor are very useful to anybody involved in web development.Maybe, I will try to improve the way we review peer's work."
5142,Very well planned course.
5143,Thank you for the excellent training.
5144,I learned bootstrap from this course for the first time and now i'm a full time web developer and i'm still using the course videos to get my hand on some components of bootstraps.
5145,love this lesson!i can understand everything and i learned so many useful things!
5146,Excellent contents!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5147,"A very good course, working on one large website project. The lecturer talks a little slowly, but makes things very clear. Some of the review criteria for the assignments are wrong for example div-xs-12 should have been col-sm-12 , which makes fair grading difficult at times."
5148,Excellent tutorials
5149,"Well, I've learnt a lot of things, thank you so much!!!"
5150,Very good. 
5151,"This course is a hit. Bootstrap is easy to use, has so many facets and applications and therefore, it's vital to understand it. Because if you understand Bootstrap, you understand HTML, CSS and at least the concept of JavaScript.Professor Jogesh manages to get all this across in a way that is focussed on a project at hand, but allows the mind to construct a complete reference and understanding for the framework as well as its underlying technologies. It is quite the feat, both as a technology and as a course."
5152,good course
5153,"great course, great instructor "
5154,great experience
5155,"Great Bootstrap course, sadly it's mandatory to pay to get a feedback with the projects"
5156,"-I like the teacher a lot. He speaks understandable, at the right speed and he explains well in my opinion.-The slides contain just the right information. I like the practical approach especially.-Assigment was a bit easy, but still covered the essentials."
5157,"This is a well-organized course, easy to understand. The knowledge is very practical and useful to front-end web development."
5158,"i think the assignment of this course was very good and i think any one that did the assignment by himself ,have learned some good web dev skills ."
5159,Best course
5160,very nice course to enable me follow up the latest web development technology applied in industry. 
5161,Well defined and covered topics.
5162,Very good video lectures
5163,It's excellent especially the pop ups during video 
5164,Great Course!
5165,Would have like it more if JQUERY section was covered in more depth covering more examples and features.
5166,good intro to bootstrap
5167,Good job
5168,"Good course, but a little expensive to participate. it's terrible that i cannot submit the assignment."
5169,??timo curso!??timo conte??do!??timo instruto!
5170,"First, the assignments always had poor instructions. It wasn't until grading time you would find out what the criteria are. (After your assignment is submitted)Secondly, there was no documentation/help for the fact the Windows needs a webserver to run content in this section. (Many versions of Windows can't do this) Discovered/resolved over many hours, when course content would not work.The actual course content was sparse/not much to it other than Bootstrap bootstrap bootstrap. After how good the first course was/how much ground it covered, this course was frustrating, poorly documented, and a disappointment."
5171,This course content is very good! but i got stuck sometimes because some program installation is very annoying(ex... bower...).
5172,Good course
5173,The teacher is very good! He explains very well and the material is very carefully prepared. Great Course!
5174,Really nice content. Great teacher
5175,"Difficult to understand, not a good explainer."
5176,Great introduction to Bootstrap and responsive design.
5177,"The lecture is well organized, slides are very clear and easy to follow. After each class, there is a clear instruction on exercises available both in PDF format and video format, which is very helpful for beginner like me. "
5178,"That was a great introduction to Bootstrap 3. And a big plus for introducing bower and npm. However, it is still recommended to code a serious webpage yourself after finishing this course to solidify the elusive knowledge."
5179,Very helpful course to get hands on using Bootstrap framework and in order to learn the responsive approach of modern web development. This course provides a good insight on front-end development. I also discovered a very nice editor called Brackets (recommended in the lessons) and used it to test the examples on my computer. Brackets has a great feature for live preview in the Chrome browser.The material has a very good structure and detail level. I want to thank to Jogesh Muppala for teaching this course. 
5180,Very nicely created course. Enjoying it :)
5181,Good course!
5182,"Well presented course, with carefully thought out exercises and assignments that all worked together to reinforce the material. The videos explaining the assignments helped to clarify the requirements, and Jogesh Muppala's sense of humour makes the lectures a pleasure to watch."
5183,clear and comprehensive
5184,thank you
5185,Very good course. Thank you HKUST!
5186,Excellent course which give a detail concept of web Programming.
5187,Excellent course
5188,A very good course. If you want to learn about Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools then this is the best source for you. The instructor is so awesome and his teaching methods are very comprehensive.
5189,Prof. Jogesh rocks!
5190,"A lot of necessaty informaton, good explonations."
5191,Fantastic!
5192,"Dr. Jogesh Muppala is a great teacher, I've never missed the way throught the course so far. Also he sometimes makes funny jokes."
5193, the course was awesome 
5194,Awful teacher
5195,This course was a good introduction at Bootstrap and front end development. It was a pleasure to listen to the lecturer.
5196,Material as well as trainer is excellent. Perfect course for beginners.
5197,very practical
5198,Excelent!
5199,Very good course. It explores most of the Bootstrap components. It gives you more that enough information to start building a nice responsive website. Many thanks to the professor and his colleagues!
5200,Really helps you to under the front-end web development
5201,"jogesh mupalla should be more descriptive about his explanation, he should explain if not all then most of the components of the bootstrap coding , which he sometimes skips or misses, otherwise the course is good"
5202,"So many powerpoint slides.. It's very boring course. The tutor just read slides without deep explanations, wikipedia much more interesting. It's just observing course, theoretical 95%."
5203, Great 
5204,"This course is excellent. I like the learn by doing method adopted and during the course you built a good website. The last part dedicated to node.js, bower and npm is very helpful to understand how to use these web tools."
5205,Really happy to getting know how bootstrap works. I have heard a lot about it but till this Course it was only magic for me.
5206,"Good content, and covered a lot in a short span of time"
5207,"The course is very nice and informative. However, in comparison to the first course, where everything was explained to you in smallest detail, here you have to think much more on your own. "
5208,Excellent introduction!
5209,Very good. Thank you
5210,"Excellent course, get you working with Bootstrap very quickly and efficiently. "
5211,good
5212,"Est?? muy bien explicado, despacio, y tiene ejercicios que se van haciendo para practicar, ademas de un peque??o cuestionario al final de cada bloque dentro de la semana, y al final de cada una de ellas."
5213,I really grateful to the Coursera as well as The Hong-Kong University of Science and Technology for providing such an opportunity to learn great technologies.I am also thankful to Professor Jogesh Muppala for guiding us throughout the course. :)
5214,Excellent!!!
5215,"+++ PROs First ++++ Pretty in-depth discussion of bootstrap+ You may watch the videos at 1.75x or 2x speed; you would enjoy the course a lot more+ You learn a lot towards the end of the course+ Homeworks were pretty good--- CONs ----- The bootstrap lessons are pretty much copy pasting code-- Week 4: Web Tools could be a little bit longer with even more examples about grunt, and Yo (we didn't see any example use cases on those topics)"
5216,Good lecture and assignment. Let me learn a lot of things.
5217,"At times the homework requirements are not well-detailed, comparing to the grading instructions."
5218,like this course
5219,the teacher is excellent
5220,Great course
5221,Excellente!
5222,tough but useful
5223,Great course
5224,I love the course and thanks Coursera to give me the chance to attend the course for free.
5225,Excelente thank you
5226,"I concur with others of a similar opinion on this course:Assignment instructions/criteria differ from the grading rubric criteria. Assignments mostly copy and paste. Referring people to the Bootstrap docs as reference defeats the purpose of an instructor. Many of the assignments required you to do things against best practices, like inserting inline styles to make your element look like the instructor's screenshot of his page.The last week's content seemed to be a slapdash mix of bits and pieces, and trying to inform people about Node modules via solving a quadratic equation seemed really strange. How about an example from the real world, like even an e-commerce application? (In the comments on this, the instructor said there wasn't time in this course to explain Node modules, but that he provided a clearer example in the Node.js course. Hunh? Why wouldn't you do a simpler example in the drive-by assignment?)Instructor consistently mispronounced words that are CENTRAL to the field, which just seemed weird and made me question his credibility. This might sound petty, but kuh-rooze-zel for the word Carousel? It would be like a fashion designer mis pronouncing tulle as tull-ee or bias as bye-ez.Just not impressed. I am glad my employer paid the tuition and not me. The only positive was it enforced a schedule and structure for me to try my hand at Bootstrap. I had already worked with Foundation."
5227,Great course! Easy to understand for a beginner and the exercises/assignments gives you hands-on experience. Highly recommended!
5228,Nice course with good explanation.
5229,Muito bom. Recomendo. Foi abordado quase tudo do bootstrap.
5230,Course content is good and it is well structured. Instructor is also quite knowledge and explains the concepts well.Definitely recommended.
5231,great course
5232,I was expecting the assignments to be harder. But overall a really good introduction to Bootstrap. 
5233,"The tutor is doing great describing everything in a short, tight format. I had a great time understanding Bootstrap.It would be great if we had more exercises. A separate project, mirroring the one from the lectures and exercises."
5234,I love Muppala!!!
5235,Perfect course
5236,Excellent course and teacher
5237,Great course! Easy to understand for a beginner and gives all necessary info for building a website.
5238,The best course I've seen! I can't describe how many new things I've learn during this course and how helpful it became for me!
5239,Very fun!
5240,Excelent!
5241,Very good course. Enjoy it a lot. Thank you Professor Jogesh.
5242,excellent course and the Teacher is the best.
5243,Good
5244,"Fairly disappointing compared to the first week of this course. The balance of instruction to exercise was very low. I also resent being sent to raw Bootstrap documentation; if I could have read that, I likely wouldn't be taking the course. It makes it frustrating to jump into the exercises when the course had 5-7 minutes of lectures, 15 minutes on the exercise and then an assignment on something new.Update: I'm also impressed by Mr. Muppala taking feedback like a boss and blaming students for low reviews."
5245,Really good course. Well structured and with a great teacher. It is really worth it.
5246,"Nice courses, covering the fundamental knowledge for Bootstrap"
5247,Great Course !!
5248,Well organized course.
5249,Really useful. Thanks for everything.
5250,Good Professor. Very knowledgeable
5251,The best way to understand Bootstrap was to do a hands-on project. Professor Jogesh Muppala has done an amazing work explaining it with the project work.
5252,Very good and interesting. I had great fun!
5253,"Very nice course, was very easy to learn from!"
5254,Really the best!!! But It will be good if lecture includes some errors we can make and silly mistakes which affects results adversely. Jogesh sir is very good teacher and he is clear and brief in less time
5255,I'm feeling great doing this specialization. Thank you by the valuable content.
5256,Top
5257,Excelent course to learn about bootstrap and fundamental CSS and Javascript.I recommend foolowing this course and his teacher.
5258,"Good Overview of Bootstrap, its usage and frameworks. "
5259,Great course for learning bootstrap and other tools! Congratulations.
5260,It was a nice time to do all these exercises and watch videos with all steps to complete the task
5261,Good but the assignments are minor changes instead of full blown impls
5262,Great course ! 
5263,"This course took me from barely understanding html5 and js to being able to create (with help) navbars, drop-downs, breadcrumbs, carousel, modals, thumbnail inserts, and a lot more. I also learned to use Brackets, a very helpful code editor. Instruction was thoroughly organized, and I never, ever found a syntax error in the code Prof. Muppala provided. I am looking forward to the next course in this full-stack series. "
5264,It nice to be building on one examples and see different ways to do it.
5265,Excellent course and instructor. I just wish the Angular course had an option to do the exercises without purchasing the course.

5268,"Course is great, but I putted 4 stars because of missing hints for assignments. It will be great to have such hints in this course."
5269,Good course! It will be much better if the slides can be packaged in a zip file for the learners to download.
5270,Nice and helpful course
5271,Great way to get started with Bootstrap's functionality and gives you a way to go past the short but important course content and figuring things out by yourself.

5276,Wonderful course and instructor!!
5277,great course
5278,"I really liked the course, and the way grading is design compared to other courses, even thought we should be able to take only some points off, many times it's partially well and would deserve only 1 or 2 points to be deducted, and we have to deduct all or none. thanks"
5279,Great course! I recommend it!
5280,The best course !
5281,awsome guide covering various tools and methods for developing a modern website. 
5282,One of the best and practical specializations on coursera.

5300,"Great class, the professor has a rather interesting sense of humor which actually makes the whole experience more enjoyable. The assignments are challenging enough to make sure you learn, but are still doable within the allotted time. One recommendation from me is to use the same tools he uses in the videos (such as Brackets) as it becomes a bonus to get familiar with new development tools. "
5301,cool
5302,One of my favorite courses! Very fruitful and interesting since it helps students to build a decent base in ???bootstrap. Highly recommended course. 
5303,Excellent introduction course!

5306,Atrav??s deste curso compreendi todas as principais funcionalidades do Boostrap. 
5307,Buen curso
5308,Fantastic course. It shows how we can leverage existing tools to build easily nice Front Ends

5312,Like the instructor a lot and how the course has been designed.
5313,"Great course, expand my knowledge and skills about bootstrap. Great excercise help me to understand the concept of bootstrap very well. Very recomended for who want to be a great website developer."
5314,very good!
5315,"This course was really helpful , it will teach you lot of things in no time ."
5316,Expertly structured Course. Great learning experience.
5317,I like how every week there is an exercise that makes all the difference when it comes to understanding concepts that have been taught
5318,could be better
5319,Excellent course for intermediates!!
5320,I love the way the professor try to explain the concepts. I really did enjoy learning this course. I would definitely recommend this course!
5321,"Excellent introduction to Bootstrap framework. The professor does a great job explaining the main features of Bootstrap and what you need to do to get started. Also introduces other web development tools such as node.js, npm, bower, less/sass CSS preprocessors, etc.. "
5322,"I wanted a structured introduction to the topics in this course and that is exactly what it gave me. The instruction is clear, precise and well delivered. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get started with web front end development."
5323,Very good course :)
5324,Fantastic course! Really comprehensive yet easy and pleasant to follow. Just a minor comment - I'd like that review criteria were more specific beforehand - I actually had lower grades in a couple of assignments due to review items that only showed up after submission.
5325,useful course.
5326,Great class and awesome teacher. Keep it up.. ! 
5327,I really liked this course and I tought it was well constructed!
5328,poor teacher.. 
5329,I really enjoy the classes in this specialisation. A lot of detail is covered in an easy to follow set of lectures. Of the MOOC classes I have taken these have been my favourite
5330,"This is a great course for anyone looking to take their knowledge of basic web design to a new level. I found bootstrap a little intimidating at first but this course does a great job of teaching and explaining it at a great pace. If you're new to web development and tired of making websites that look like they're from the 90s, bootstrap is a great tool to get your websites to look modern and professional. The instructor is very knowledgeable and explains things thoroughly (he's also very funny!). I recommend incorporating the additional learning materials as they will help you understand the concepts discussed in the lectures on a much deeper level. Lastly, be sure to do every exercise as they are essential to completing the assignments. Have fun!"
5331,Great professor and good explanations with a bit of a challenge with the assignments which made you have to make sure you understand the material.
5332,Awesome Course.. The way of teaching is very nice.. After taking this course now I am able to make responsive design using bootstrap.
5333,"Good course for learning Bootstrap, delivered well by the instructor."
5334,Good Course
5335,Nice course. Gave all the necessary insights about how UI of modern day professional web sites is made.
5336,"a great course to learn bootstrap, jquery, less, sass and web tools like bower"
5337,Awesome jokes!!
5338,Great course for beginners!
5339,Very good course and very helpful.
5340,"The course is pretty well structured and the exercises were explained pretty well. It was pretty easy to follow the steps and do the assignments, but sometimes required a little bit more explanation on what does what, and why sometimes even after following his steps, our website might not look similar to what he has done on the exercise. One thing also if possible I'm not sure if carousel is pronounced ka-ruu-sel in Hong Kong, but it's Char-uh-sel like the ride, which to me was quite annoying to listen to."
5341,Good course to take to advance bootstrap framework knowledge.
5342,Excellent course!
5343,A very good course. The best what I have seen in this area. I would make only some minor changes but I didn't watch the first course so there might be some complementary information what I don't know or wanted this course to have. The first 3 weeks is nice package for learning Bootstrap.
5344,Good Course for bootstrap introduction
5345,"I found this course an excellent expansion to what I already know about HTML, CSS and JS. There were points where I was frustrated and confused, but the material is presented clearly and enough reference links were provided that I wasn't frustrated or confused very long. I appreciated the instructor's sense of humor and the presentation of the material. I recommend it if you need Bootstrap familiarity and associated knowledge."
5346,Professor Muppala is an excellent teacher.
5347,the course is very good... perfect explanations and challenging assignments
5348,Great lectures to take put you right on track!
5349,Awesome course!!! very satisfied!!
5350,It gives you a lot of information about Bootstrap and various tool you can use for Front-End Web Development. It gives you hand on experience with Bootstrap and how it functions. It doesn't explain to you everything which can be a good thing or bad thing depending on how you see it. Overall it's a great course that makes you see how Web UIs are made.
5351,Exceptional.
5352,"This course was pretty cool. A lot of very useful stuff was covered, but I feel like it went too fast.But I think it could be better connected together in terms of broad principles, rather than just going through tons of particular examples. I still don't feel like I have a mental framework for how to lay out a web page, other than the basics of the 12-column grid system. It all seemed very ad hoc.It's by no means a bad course, and I still gave it four stars since the material is very useful, but I definitely think it could be improved upon.Also, the ratio of homework/lectures is way too low. I definitely think the course should put more emphasis on actually creating websites oneself. Many of the homework assignments took me under an hour -- after I spent hours watching all the videos and taking notes trying to remember it all."
5353,Super useful and practical!
5354,"I like the way of explanation, and good to know some more interesting things in bootstrap "
5355,"I so much enjoyed learning with Mr.Muppala. I love his style, course structure, clarification. Made me really enjoy web development. Thank you :)"
5356,Great course. I've learned a lot.
5357,Great Review of Bootstrap and UI Frameworks. Not very difficult at all.
5358,"Excellent course, excellent instructor, excellent material!This course really taught me a lot."
5359,Good course covers all the basics
5360,the lectures sometimes used to get very boring :-|
5361,Great course about Bootstrap
5362,great course! Really up to date. :)
5363,"Excellent tutor, excellent contents in notes. In one word Outstanding"
5364,"Very generous and clearly delivered content. Most Coursera courses only manage to scratch the surface due to time and attention span restrictions, but this one really tries to provide a complete overview of the many possibilities that you can explore later by yourself."
5365,Excellent teacher and course format / materials. Teacher also makes a big effort to answer questions in the forum also. 
5366,Excellent
5367,"Easy to learn, great contents"
5368,Great course for beginners. 
5369,This course contains almost every aspect of bootstrap and is a great course for anyone to get started with frontend frameworks. The teacher Jogesh sir has a very good way of teaching. Happy feeling after studying this.
5370,It???s very difficult to listen what the teacher say. The teacher is not good for expression.????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
5371,"Solid course, very hands-on, accomplishes its goals."
5372,"The lecturer is clear, but there is a problem with the paste.It is much too slow. He states the obvious too often, talks VERY slowly, and that makes it hard to stay focused."
5373,Thank you professor Jogesh K Muppala.This is one of the best courses in the UI domain and any one interested must attend.The best part was the hands on teaching methodology and added to this the spice up was What mistake I made - learn and correct by validating other participants work... I enjoyed it..... :)Apologies for always been the late latif in submissions... 
5374,"Excellent, clear and complete course."
5375,Good walkthru of the basics of bootstrap (and more)
5376,"excellent course, great instructor and material "
5377,100%

5381,Badiya hai!!! :D
5382,Great course.
5383,Cool.
5384,This instructor is awesome. Would love to see more material from him.
5385,"Even if I have worked with Bootstrap before, I found this course very useful to review and deepen my skills. The lessons and exercises are very clearly explained. The course is easy to follow and very enjoyable. I took this course as part of the Full Stack Web Development Specialization. "
5386,Excellent teaching! Learning made easy in baby steps... very useful for beginners with little experience in web developing. Recommended!!
5387,"This course is very good. I took me from zero Bootstrap to a very competent level. I was even able to make a side website project that I now use at work. There are minor things that are not explained, but extra material is provided, so no problem."
5388,Great course and great staff
5389,Nice overview of bootstrap and why css frameworks are used. Time well spent! 
5390,It's a good introduction to understand how Bootstrap works. 
5391,Great introduction to Web UI Frameworks!
5392,"Excellent course on the topic, I say. Good and detailed videos and explanations, a lot of links to improve your knowledge when / where you want to read more on topic(s) , nice and challenging enough topics for practice and checking your understanding.Thank you very much, Jogesh K. Muppala for such interesting and deep course. "
5393,"Very good teacher with a complete material , excellent examples and exercises . Congratulations !!"
5394,Very useful course.
5395,Can't wait to learn!
5396,"This is a very good course to be introduced to Bootstrap. During the course, you create your own website so you always use the things you just learned. Also, the course is very well structured."
5397,"This is a good course. Even though the exercises are not graded, they are important."
5398,Brilliant coursework :)
5399,It would be better if the assignments were not guided so straight forward.
5400,Very interesting and comprehensive course
5401,great introduction
5402,Very detailed and informative course with lots of hands-on exercises.
5403,Very Good
5404,"This course was very well-designed and prepared. The professor has a great way to present the material in a thorough, methodic manner. Lots of attention is given to practical exercises which are easy to follow and greatly help in digesting large amounts of material that the professor presents."
5405,Pedagogical and to the point.
5406,Amazing Course to get a hang of how modern web pages are made
5407,This instructor is excellent! He makes it very easy to follow along. I've learned much!
5408,Excellent course that slowly builds up a web site with exercises and assignments. Instructor has good sense of humor which makes the lectures interesting and fun. 
5409,A great course. I recommend it 
5410,First course by David Rossiter set the bar very high. This is like going through a manual or series of instructions. Would like 2 courses to be taken by David and 2 by Jogesh...Else the style becomes very monotonous. The course by David was awesome. This is not as good
5411,very good course.Thanks 
5412,Breaks page in end.. Some of Bootstrap components were only described do this and this instead WHAT are the parts and options and WHY do we do this and that.
5413,Its really awesome. 
5414,"Great intro course that fully dives into Bootstrap and all it's capabilities. The site that you build in this course can actually be a decent addition to any portfolio for a new web designer too. I would have given it a 5/5, but I thought the course moved too slowly and rushed over explaining the available JavaScript and jQuery plugins that Bootstrap has to offer. The plugins are quite useful not just within Bootstrap, and they can be installed and customized for a range of web projects.Expect to dedicate at least 3-4 hours a week just completing the module lectures and exercises along with the homework assignment. This is not out of the ordinary though, Bootstrap does have a lot of components to cover. I truly believe Professor Muppala is the best person to do it as well. I appreciated his input in the discussion forums and thorough instruction. "
5415,"4rd assignment is tooooo easy - i expect here complicated task with non-trivial work with modules but not this child's plays.Other assignments and lectures looks good, but here is too many errors in subtitles - not critical but in every video i detect at least 1-2"
5416,Great instructor!
5417,Coursera is the best!!
5418,"Un contenido muy trabajado. Bajo mi punto de vista un gran curso, considero que los profesores le han dedicado mucho tiempo a su elaboraci??n.Un curso magn??fico para iniciarse y la mejora de conocimientos de dise??o Web con Bootstrap "
5419,"If you want to understand Bootstrap and, by extension, other similar front-end frameworks, then this course is for you. Prof Jogesh's light-hearted approach to teaching is very interesting and makes learning a very big fun! "
5420,Very great course for web development with real examples
5421,It is slow. but very good.
5422,Very intresting course.Thank you so much
5423,"A very easy,lucid hands on Bootstrap, Excellent teaching by Prof.A must do course for for aspiring Web Entrepreneurs..."
5424,"Mr Jogesh Muppala explains in detail and very clear how to use Bootstrap. He explains each step he does in detail, his code is easy to understand and is very helpful towards students. Thanks to him I finally understood how the grid classes in Bootstrap work."
5425,Muy completo y muy pr??ctico. Los felicito.
5426,Awesome!
5427,Excellent course!!Thank you
5428,great course
5429,"Very good introductory course. You do have to be somewhat familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript to get the most of it. The course is sometimes superficial, but it does teach you a lot in very little time. Great course!"
5430,It is an easy course.
5431,It is highly recommended for introducing Bootstrap.
5432,Perfect course! Explanation is very good and the examples help you get through all assignment. 
5433,Excellent course. Great instructor.
5434,Excel??lent!
5435,Great explanations and exercises. 
5436,"Great course. From my experience in Coursera, it is perfect presentation. Only one thing. Instead of inserting block of code, during exercise, better when instructor is typing the code. So, it comes to better realize for a student, feeling where he is, at the point. "
5437,One of the best course in Front-End Web UI Framework in Coursera!!!!!!
5438,"I found this course greatly useful in learning everything about Bootstrap: from basic grid system to interactive classes, as well as javascript, jQuery and more."
5439,Excellent teaching process which makes you really learn the material to get the grades.
5440,I could learn and practice bootstrap components in this course. 
5441,Nicely done and very helpful course for beginners.
5442,"A very detailed and professional class for web developers. It is very good for someone who want to focus on web development!! I was your student in HKUST android class, thank you professor!"
5443,good
5444,"80% focused on bootstrap framework, all the explanations were pretty clear to me."
5445,One of the most educative and comprehensive style of giving materials I've been seen for now.
5446,Very well structured. I would recommend it to everyone who are interested in web development.
5447,great!!!
5448,Very beneficial. And the professor is awesome.
5449,Great course. Great introduction to Bootstrap.
5450,it's really a deep look into the bootstrap frameworkIt's excellent to the newbies of bootstrap to cahge them from zeros to heros but for a man like me that have been working for 3 years with bootstrap it was tedious but had to take it to complete the speclization

5457,I enjoyed every detail. Best web learning experience so far.
5458,"I had used Bootstrap out of necessity in the past, picking up bits here and there. This course was excellent for filling in the gaps and giving a proper overview of Bootstrap and how it can (and should) be used for front-end development. "
5459,It is awesome
5460,Not the best tutor but perhaps one of the worst. Hard to understand what he's trying to say.
5461,Thank you for an excellent course!
5462,Great!
5463,I found week two to really outweigh the others in terms of difficulty in the assignment but It's probably the week I learnt the most! Great Job!!
5464,"Amma mia ! ,Good course."
5465,Awesome teacher and course !
5466,Very intersting and exiting work please keep going.
5467,"Good teacher with expirience. Help to understand and learn a lot of Bootstrap features. And thanks for node.js, and for bower in last week.Thanks you, Jogesh Muppala."
5468,Great intro for Bootstrap with appropriate exercises. Very informative and will never go back to vanilla HTML!
5469,Excellent course and great study material
5470,I Learnt a lot. Thank you
5471,It was an excellent course!!
5472,"Great course, great instructor, lot of interesting material!"
5473,"As an experienced web developer, I'm not sure I'm in the target for this course, but it covers all important principles in Bootstrap, shows how to use most components, and gives pointers to more advanced articles that are really interesting. So it's 5 stars for me : I learned all I need to know to become proficient with Bootstrap on my enterprise projects !"
5474,very interesting and course. I recommend it highly. steep learning curve
5475,good???
5476,Well formed with lots of details course!
5477,"Good coverage of bootstrap, but the other parts were very briefly touched upon (nodejs, bower etc.)"
5478,really nice course! Check It Out!
5479,Straight forward and involving
5480,I like thecourse.I think it's benifi
5481,Prof. Muppala is a great instructor. This was a very engaging course. 
5482,A great course.
5483,"I wish, the professor could pay more attention to from questions from students."
5484,"This is the second course in the Full Stack series by Hong Kong University. Because I find the first course in this series very interesting (the assignments are challenging and easy to understand; the professor does a very good job in explaining the materials), I continue to take the second course, which is this one, a shoot. However, it is a complete disappointment. In every single assignment, it requires a file, which is built by going through every single lectures of the course. That means I have to go through every videos and copy his code to my code in order to get the file. If you have a lot of time, that is perfectly fine. However, if you are a college student like me, you properly will not be able to commit that much time. Personally, when I take a course, I take a look at the assignment and then see what knowledge I need to have in order to complete the assignment. Because of this, I may watch the lecture or just Google out the answer. Requiring a file in order to complete an assignment strips away my liberty in doing so. Furthermore, if you miss a step in the video, your file may very well be ruined and you need to rewatch the video again to see what you missed.Also, the course is extremely slow paced. I have to play back rate to x1.5 normal speed. Sadly, even with faster speed, the lectures are also poorly structured. There are many other materials online that can cover the same amount of information in less time and easier to understand. Combined with the required file for each assignment, this course can easily be a torture."
5485,"Great introduction to using Bootstrap properly as well as basic use of node, Less and bower"
5486,Instructions are very clear and very useful!
5487,Excelente!!!!
5488,"Excellent lessons, complete and comprehensive"
5489,"I enjoyed this quite a bit. I already knew some bootstrap, but following along in this course really cemented the ideas well and showed me new views on the material."
5490,NIce Examples of bootstrap and good idea about bower library package manager and node.js
5491,Very good course on Boostrap. It was great to have an introduction to this framework. The teachers did a good job in explaining the concepts. The videos and the materials are very good.It would be great to have a follow-up course to learn more advanced stuff.
5492,The explanation with examples is pretty clear to understand.Course contents are perfect.
5493,I had a lot of fun completing this one.
5494,Es un buen curso como introducci??n a Bootstrap

5500,Good course for greenhand.
5501,Fantastic materials and great instructor!
5502,"This Course is very useful for me , cause after this course I find a job of Front-End development"
5503,"One of the best course I have taken in Coursera. Very well structured, the professor makes every concept looks really simple. The assignments are the best part, they give us the confidence you need to start designing your own responsive front-end web application from scratch. The level is suitable for beginner and mid-level."
5504,"A good course, content are a little bit too much in 4 weeks study. Exercises and assignment are easy. "
5505,Very well done with excellent videos and examples. Great intro to Bootstrap.
5506,"Its awesome course, very good for people want to learn Bootstrap, Node.js....Building website from start is a good approach.Jogesh Muppala just rocked it.Eagerly waiting for AngularJs sessions."

5509,very comprehensive and good introduction to Bootstrap and jQuery
5510,Very helpful. I would recommend.
5511,Very good course for introductory purposes nevertheless practice makes perfection
5512,"preety boring, lots of code copying. "
5513,I prefer anonymous classmates reviewing.
5514,very explanative
5515,"Well structured, and covers most topics in Bootstrap and more. Strongly recommended, and looking forward to the coming courses. "
5516,Quite useful 
5517,This is so much building me from ground up.
5518,Really liked the structure of the course. Concepts were introduced gracefully. These were then well practised with detailed examples. The comments added by Professor Jogesh were quite refreshing too.
5519,Excellent course
5520,Teacher is very smart and he use a really nice methodology
5521,It is easy and interesting.
5522,"First of all, Thank you for the video. I liked it very much. Course is in very detailed indeed with lots of information. "
5523,Great course. Thanks for your time mr. Muppala :)

5527,A very informative course 
5528,Very good but should be longer
5529,Excellent.... 
5530,Great course. exercise and assignment are carefully designed to reiterate the concept. Practical tools are like LESS/SASS are covered. The approach to have students help grade each other homework is very good.
5531,Great job and a detailed explanation.
5532,I really like this course. It provides a wide aspect of bootstrap and good exercise. Learned a lot from this course.
5533,This topic and especially a whole course is mandatory for any front-end developer. Thank you!
5534,Very enjoyable course.
5535,"enjoyed the course a lot! Our professor made this course what it is, thank you!"
5536,"This is the best teacher, you learn a lot in a short time. "
5537,Excellent course with useful examples. I really recommend this course.
5538,Genial!!!!!!Awesome!!!!!
5539,"Although the course structure and information is great, the course exercise and grading organization has a lot of space for improvement. Current structure doesn't make it possible for the learner to determine the speed. All the parts are equally important. You have to carefully go through hours of instructions. Each week and the assignment builds on what you have done before, but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations. This causes a lot of confusion.Peer evaluation rules are not shown before you submit your work. After submitting my work, I discovered that there are requirements that were not in the assignment."
5540,Excellent course. One of the best tech courses I've taken. I'm experienced in Java technologies but only back-end and Swing. And now it opens me a whole new world.I'm grateful. Thank you.The only drawback is that I really want to pay for the entire Full Web Development course but I can't find a way to pay for all the courses and keep the grades I got in the first two courses.Thank you!
5541,O curso ?? muito bom. Recomendo!
5542,Excellent course! A great way to learn the basics of Bootstrap.
5543,This is where I started to open the new beautiful world of Front-End Web Development :)
5544,The best one.
5545,"Professor, I truly enjoyed your course. The exercises were very clear and you are an amazing teacher! Thanks so much!"
5546,Proffesor Jogesh K. Muppala is probably the best instructor I have ever met in Coursera. He is active on discussions and really help us to understand the topic. He is also has a great sense of humor and his lecture videos are magnificent. Good Work :)
5547,"Very good content, lots of exercises to get familiar, very good professor."
5548,Amazing course and the teachers are very funny
5549,"This course was awesome! I have been studying web development for quite a while--I even have several completed projects under my belt--but, this course filled in a ton of gaps in my knowledge. I expected to breeze through the material without learning much, but to my surprise, I learned something new in each lesson. Jogesh Muppala is an awesome professor. He explains things well and is very active in the course discussions. I would recommend any course he facilitates!!"
5550,Excellent course
5551,"It was simple yet useful, and the instructor is definitely a nice guy!"
5552,Good introduction with practice.Unfortunately no certificate of accomplishment is available. This makes the Coursera platform less interesting.
5553,"A great course! A good mix of walkthroughs and challenges with a nice dose of humor mixed in. Jogesh is a great professor. If you want to learn bootstrap, look no further than this course!"
5554,This course made my knowledge clear. There is a lot practice and thats cool.
5555,"Very thorough, hands-on."
5556,"This course is AMAZING! It was the BEST course I've ever taken in Coursera. Prof. Muppala is great, his lectures cover everything you need, so you do not feel lost at all although you learn pretty advanced stuff.. Course material is well-organized, and exercises go great with assignments. In short, this course is not like other introductory courses that just teach simple things or syntax. I really felt that I learned some stuff that I can actually use for my own projects. "
5557,Thank you for this best lecture.
5558,"This one is much harder and time consuming, compared to the first course of the specialization.Also, to receive maximum points for assignment, you need to think ahead and make things assignment don't ask you directly (like removing the script if you're not using it, you'll receive 5 pts).Good course anyway."
5559,Great Course!
5560,"Excellent course, simple and easy to follow instructions, very complete."
5561,I have learnt a lot in this course. It is a well thought interesting course. You will have to work hard but it is well worth it. Perfect courses 100%.
5562,"I like the course, I think it is complete"
5563,Very interesting course ; the level is neither too easy nor too hard.Explanations from Jogesh are very clearThanks a lot
5564,"Thank you so much for the course. It is one of the best one I have had. The material was explained thoroughly, additional resources were extremely useful and the videos provided sufficient examples. Also, the teaching style (and humor) are greatly appreciated. I learned a lot, while also consolidating my knowledge from Mr. Rossiter's class (HTML, CSS and JS). Many thanks!"
5565,Very good materials and practices. Thanks!
5566,"Excellent course. Good preparation for the course by instructor, and guidance in discussion forums. If you want to learn a good amount in short period of time, this is recommended. Nice set of assignments that give you a feeling of accomplishing something with what you are learning."
5567,"This course teach a lot and there is a lot of course requered and additional material. Everything is well explained and the instructor is awesome and funny. It is time demanding, but worth all the time you spend learning."
5568,"This course is a requisite for anyone wanting to learn and apply frameworks for client side web development. What takes this course to 5-stars is the instructor, Jogesh Muppala. Aside from his humour, he prepares the content of this course in such an unambiguous and clear format that I think the material would be enjoyed by even the most diehard non-techy. There is a wide assortment of Coursera experiences but I would say that this should be the type other instructors aspire to duplicate."
5569,"Great Course, hard fun!!!"
5570,This course give me a great understanding on the bootstrap framework.I'm happy because I can now build awesome web interfaces with the skills that I have learned here.
5571,The best course for Bootstrap!!! Thanks a million!!!
5572,currently at week 2 - learning bootstrap is a great fun.
5573,I would like the course to be more dynamic.

5606,"Very informative and fun approach to the Bootstrap framework, thank you to Dr. Mappala and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for making this class available to everybody through Coursera."
5607,nice one
5608,Great Learning
5609,Excelente
5610,Excellent instructor.
5611,Thank you.
5612,Overall is Ok. It gives you a grasp of the technology but do not expect to become an expert in Bootstrap or jQuery after this course. You still have to learn &amp; practice a lot. 
5613,Very Good
5614,"Focuses on Bootstrap responsive design and Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. You will learn to create professional looking and responsive web pages. Also there is introduction to some web tools including node.js, NPM (node package manager) and Bower. Highly recommend this course to anyone learning front-end web dev. Great course. Great Instructor. "
5615,Great course to introduce you to developing using bootstrap framework
5616,"It is very good. The teacher is full of positive energy and his efforts to make us learn is amazing. The assignments are not difficult as with enough attention during the lessons, you can do them with a bit of effort. Highly recommended."
5617,this is great course
5618,"Thanks all for this greate course, I want to give special thank to our teacher Mr Jogesh K. Muppala."

5620,Excellent course
5621,Super! Very valuable experience with Bootstrap!
5622,"Nice,i think bootstrap not too hard to understand."
5623,"Awesome Course , with a lot of details and great information also ... thanks to coursera they always bring to us a great value of knowledge "
5624,It is a great course. Detailed information in this course about Bootstrap has helped me a lot.
5625,I found the material was good and the instructor was engaging. I appreciate that he tries to make learning hands on. Overall I found this a great introduction to Bootstrap. My only criticism is that at times I felt like I was only copying and pasting code rather than really learning the material. I ended up copying and pasting plenty of tags that are never really mentioned or explained. 
5626,Very Good Experience
5627,"Good one to start with. Even though it is just basics, but a good foundation."
5628,Perfect.
5629,"this course in an excellent course , the instructors are well trained and excellent in programing. If i get children I will think a way of sending them to Hong kong to study this university "
5630,"It was a really good course. Some negative comments say things about the instructor speaking slow or do not liking the way exercises are donde (following the video). The instructor is clearly a non-native english speaker so it is normal that he does not speak it the way most are used to, but you can set the reproduction rate to a higher one.Everything else was just perfect and I really learned a lot."
5631,I learned a lot in this course. The instructor was clear.
5632,Good Course
5633,"great course, rich in vital information for new developers"
5634,Great course
5635,"A very good course that introduces important topics, tools and techniques"

5637,GOOD!!
5638,Loved it
5639,Good Course Work!! Very Good Faculty!!
5640,Cursos excelente. Aprendi muito de bootstrap e front end com este curso.
5641,The only problem on this journey with Jogesh sir is that it seems like I have got to know his quirkiness so well that he feels like someone I would love to know personally but can't! I enjoy the way he seems to simplify concepts and bring them together in the end to make even the most difficult concept seem entirely simple.
5642,"Great course, well designed, everything is great, but there's always a room for improvement. may be more excercises will help improve it"
5643,"Really great! The materials, exercises and assignments. I would defiantly recommend someone to do this. One will have a great appreciation for bootstrap and the tools covered in this course."
5644,Very interesting.
5645,Excellent course for boot-strap
5646,So Userfull and funny course. it's very good if you want to leard front web UI developer.
5647,"This course was awesome! The mentor taught all the topics with such great ease and in the correct order. Not only the coding part was given value, its implications were also kept in mind. I would like to recommend this course to enhance your front-end skills. This course gives you whatever it has promised. Do check this course :)"
5648,Excellent lecturer. Gained a deeper insight into Bootstrap.
5649,Great course!
5650,"Very good course to take, the instructor will walk step by step through the course. Although is one course but gives you lots of components needed to be a good front-end developer. Some people saying in their comments that the course or the instructor is boring, but I'm telling you from my experience this course is worth to take it and to be frank no course is easy or sweet no matter who teach just be patient and you will learn. Thanks "
5651,The accent and rhythm of Jogesh makes it difficult to follow the course.There is no extra information in addition to the presentation. The teacher is only reading the slides which makes the experience quite limited/boring.The content is enough to get an idea of Bootstrap basic functionality.
5652,Excellent Course to learn Responsive web design
5653,Excellent
5654,Good course 
5655,fantastic Course !

5675,"Very Nice course. I have gained some confidence in Bootstrap now. I will like to Thank, Prof. Muppala for his hard effort for us students. Thank you Sir."
5676,comprehensively teaches the topics and impressed with it 
5677,Really good course for those who want to learn more about Bootstrap and basic stuff about front-end technologies.
5678,it was a good course. but it was super boring as hellthat's why I didn't continue learning the other modulesmost of coursera's courses as boring but this was the most boring
5679,Very nice! Some things I felt that went too fast but in general it was great!
5680,"The assignment instructions weren't clear and when uploading the assignment files, the pages didn't render properly. This also was a problem during peer review of assignments."
5681,Excellent course!
5682,"Absolutely great course, I learned a lot."
5683," Excellent course! It gave me an excellent introduction to a wide range of bootstrap components. I learned how to use bootstrap and its CSS clases and JavaScript components in my site, how to use bower to manage my project's dependencies, how to make some very basic functions using JQuery and how to use Less and Sass to preprocess my Stylesheets in a more handy way. I loved this course, because even when it seems to be very basic, i feel la I know a lot about this technologies i've learned. This is a must if you're new to bootstrap or some Web Development tools based on nodejs like Bower, Sass or Less "
5684,A great course to learn about bootstrap if you are a beginner. 
5685,Awesome course indeed. I bet these courses are more credible than the degree courses which we follow at most of the universities.
5686,Nice Course
5687,Very good
5688,Good
5689,Great course to understand responsive design and to take a nice and deep start up with bootstrap framework! 
5690,Excellent course. The content is well organized. It has a short task after each module. It helps a lot to understand every part of the course. I highly recommend it!!!
5691,very good course. I add this comment when I review this course :)
5692,"It's the very good course, the professor has a incridible form to explain."
5693,Thanks for this opportunity!
5694,Good and Informative
5695,"I was able to learn Bootstrap effectively from this course. The assignments were good practise. However, reviewing other peoples assignments was a bit annoying, as their files had to be downloaded and put opened in a browser and it was a bit of as tedious process. The teaching style was good. "
5696,good
5697,"The assignment instructions and grading criteria are unclear/incomplete. Because of this, given these are peer graded assignments, it is likely to lose marks because the peers interpreted the instructions differently. Some of the topics covered in the lectures are not covered in the assignments, while other topics which are not covered are. All assignments build upon the code written in the exercises in all previous weeks, so there is no way to know if you are starting off with correct code. The lecture videos contain a lot of code examples, but the various key notions covered are not explained and the assumption seems to be you will look those up in the API. Sometimes the code examples in the slides contain mistakes. It sometimes felt like the content covered in the videos could have been delivered in a much shorter time."
5698,Very well delivered. I do believe however that the peer review may sometimes let certain details slip through and as a result the learning experience might be not as good as it could be.
5699,"Good, if basic, intro to frameworks and tools."
5700,It is an awsome course. 
5701,Very very helpful course! The instructor speed slowly and I can listen the course clearly! Thank you!
5702,Excellent Course
5703,good instructions
5704,I feel like the Bootstrap content was very well presented. It was easy for me to understand and I had no major problems with assignments after watching all the materials and doing excersies along the way. 
5705,"Easy, but learned a lot."
5706,A good course to getting used to how things work and being briefly exposed to the tools available.
5707,"Good Teaching method! professor teaches very nicely!, Easy to learn!Thank you.Team: Couresera"
5708,It is always fun learning in Coursera! Professor Muppala made it even more interesting.Thank you sir!I feel more hands on assignments to have a better understanding will be more exciting .
5709,"It was an excellent journey on Bootstrap. The instructor, Mr Jogesh was really helpful in taking us through the course giving a strong insight into the bootstrap world. This course has given me a confidence in building a responsive website UI ahead. Hoping to enhance the knowledge in the coming courses in the specialization and build a strong career as Web dev.Thank You, Sir!"
5710,"It's always tricky to create a course on a framework, since it's always updating itself, but this is a solid base if you think you can't manage to learn everything on your own and need a place to start. After this you'll be familiar with the concept of UI frameworks and therefore will be easier to learn them in the future."
5711,Great course for learning and understanding Bootstrap.
5712,Great Course
5713,"Professor Muppala thank you, you really taught me a lot"
5714,Good
5715,Great introduction to Bootstrap and LESS. Assignments are practical and build on each other.
5716,Nice approach!
5717,I don't like the teacher
5718,This course is good and simple with explanation and i prefer anyone to take it because it is useful
5719,I was a really good course. However some of the assignment tasks could have been a bit more complex (For example week 4).
5720,Excellent course with good challenging assignments. It improves our understanding in designing complex webpages in a smooth and easier way. Recommended for everyone who are wishing to grow as a web developer.
5721,In this course we can learn about the fundamentals of front-end web development and some useful tools. 
5722,This course is a must for students / professional who are passionate about Web development. Provides a good understanding of skills that are required for one to succeed. 
5723,awesome course with very good practice but explanation need to be more enthusiastic
5724,"Great course on bootstrap, after it you will have no problem creating a beautiful static webpage"
5725,"Great course! For a beginner, it integrates basic concepts and wonderful practices, so that I got the knowledge and practical skills to build a beautiful and attractive web-pages. Also, it provides a broaden view of the techs in the web-development area. Thank you all the staff!"
5726,thx
5727,Good
5728,All around great platform to learn on
5729,Wonderful!
5730,Professionally handled course that is easy to understand and teaches you a lot!
5731,Awesome course !!A must for those interested in easy UI development of website using bootstrap.
5732,Excellent course! It was a very good experience. In recommend everyone this course in order to improve your skills.
5733,Very good introduction for bootstrap
5734,"I think this course was way too ambitious. It's neat to imagine learning all of this stuff in four weeks, but one should be realistic. Sure, we had lectures explaining things, but in the end we mostly had to copy-and-paste code and confirm that it worked. There should have been many, many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understanding.Perhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate. To really understand and absorb this stuff, I'll need to spend a lot of time with the additional resources. The lectures and scaffolded exercises certainly exposed us to a lot, but it would be hard to say I really learned very much."
5735,Very basic course. It's not worth it 70$
5736,Great course!
5737,I can't stress enough how much my view towards front end development changed after taking this course. And have never stopped using the tools that I learnt here.
5738,I reminds me what I did to my previous company. It is like a brush up and the instructor is good in delivering the content.
5739,Excellent course.
5740,I found excellent with Practical examples and assimilation As gradual Learning .
5741,good
5742,good
5743,Great course

5745,good course.
5746,Good course and assignments!
5747,The course content was very informative and straight to the point. 
5748,Great course
5749,"wonderful course well structured learning material .Any one interested in web Development must do this course.Thank you ,Sir for teaching and providing us such a informative course ."
5750,Very Good Course
5751,Good .-.

5753,Great course and also great teacher
5754,Good lecture for knowing Bootstrap! 
5755,"Excelente Curso, muy didactvo"
5756,Comprehensive guide to bootstrap
5757,"Course content is good, however instructions for the assignments are not complete. Often, instructions for the assignments that are required in the grading criteria are buried in the discussion forums, sometimes in multiple threads. And the method of grading is also only explained in the discussion forum. This can lead to the peer review grades being difficult to assign. The assignment pages should be updated to properly include ALL requirements and an explanation of how to grade the assignment."
5758,very good
5759,Very nice course
5760,good
5761,Good 
5762,Thanks You
5763,good
5764,This is interesting
5765,Great and giving - i can now apply my newly achieved knowledge into my daily work. 
5766,"It is amazing how we learn on Coursera courses. We have build a solid atarting point on Bootstrap framework, understanding the main classes. We are already able to build something real web design."
5767,A very interesting course and a good overview of Bootstrap. The teacher's style helps a lot to grab new concepts.
5768,Challenging and fun
5769,Good professional advices. Much more than a simple tutorial.
5770,this course one of the most fantastic courses i take
5771,very clear and organized course
5772,great to understand basics of Bootstrap
5773,Very nice tutorial for starters. Includes all the necessary documentation needed and the exercises are very well planned such that they cover all the concepts. Highly engaging tutor. Strongly recommend!
5774,I loved this course. While this course will not make you an expert with Bootstrap it will however take you up to a level where you're able to learn on your own and actually understand why is something happening when it's happening.
5775,"Good course, i liked the exercises. It is well explained, but you also need to learn/read from other sites (what is linked as resource), to be able to do the weekly tasks. I liked this approach, the teacher is explaining the lectures well."
5776,"Excellent professor, excellent material, excelent course! :)"
5777,Very nice method to teach the basics of bootstrap frameworks. I recommend this course!
5778, Really good course on Bootstrap and Responsive design.
5779,Brilliant bootstrap. Strap on your boots and be prepared for a journey into the inner workings of Bootstrap (shamelessly 'borrowed' this pun from the course).
5780,Maybe the best first contact with bootstrap for any web developer 
5781,excellent!
5782,Learned a lot!
5783,Very well explained! Details hand on exercises that help a lot understanding the subjects 
5784,Great!
5785,Excellent course.
5786,vraiment satisfait
5787,Awesome!
5788,Good teaching method
5789,The course offers good material and covers the minimum requirements of bootstrap. The additional resources provided by the instructor are great for futher reading. The problem is the instructor delivers the material in an organized way but he is very slow. 
5790,Best Courser for beginner
5791,"I really liked that, I never coded anything with Bootstrap and it was awesome. Now I'm prepared and ready to go ahead with Angular Course."
5792,Very useful course. Professor explained material in a nice and interesting way.
5793,Nice course!
5794,Good
5795,I can beat my chest and say I know bootstrap it was an awesome experience... I was taught well which is a whole lot better than self learning/teaching which leaves a you with a whole lot of unknown information about the subject.
5796,"My frst Certificated Courera Course.I took about 12 hours to finish it.I think this Course is a 5-star-course, and maybe the best Bootstrap MOOC course on Internet;The curriculum is set reasonably,I believe with this course finished ,you will have a solid grasp of bootstrap,and know how to build enterprise Web UI.what's more,the Professor is very kind and with a sense of humor."
5797,Great Bootstrap usage and explanation of classes in the framework. 
5798,i'm really glad i took this course most especially when it comes to bower et al. Really really glad for the opportunity. thank you
5799,"good course with clear explanation, thank you "
5800,It's a good course where I come across bower and CSS how to use the function for the UI frameworks.
5801,"I have learned many thing by attending the class, which is good for helping me find a job."
5802,Extremely practical! Thank you 
5803,really good
5804,"For all the many courses I took on Coursera, this course is one of the best."
5805,"I would like to express my gratitude to prof. Muppala for this incredible course.There are indeed many great resources for learning any of the technologies and tools used in this course and specialization. But what is unique about this specialization, is that it gives us not only solid foundations needed to use these tools, but, just as importantly, a clear context as to where a certain tool or its segment is used. Sure enough, having in mind the broader context, it is much easier to understand all of the segments individually.I would also like to thank Kre??imir and all the other mentors that helped make this course a pleasant experience.I can't wait for the next course on Angular JS to start!"
5806,This course can be a bit dry at times. But still very informative
5807,awesome course... 
5808,Good course with great teacher
5809,Great intro to bootstrap. I feel like more bootstrap features and web tools could have been covered. 
5810,Really nice
5811,I enjoyed the course. Not a difficult course but the course experience was great. Instructor was also really good at explaining concepts.
5812,helps to know every section of bootstrap
5813,Perfect Bootstrap learning course.
5814,NICE EXPERIANCE
5815,very good ! This course help me a lot. Really appreciate ! 
5816,"Valuable and very well organized, I found it quite simple"
5817,Very useful course
5818,"Enjoyed the course!I learned bootstrap before from codeschool, but it wasn't as good as this course!"
5819,"The topic is overall well covered.The material are not easy to go through and do not reference well key knowledge area, specifically: how to apply them.The exercises and the assignments could be largely improved: the targets and the guidance are not always clear. Adding up on the same files instead having one file per exercice / one learning key point does not help."
5820,Good Course
5821,It is a very useful course
5822,Well Organized and very instructive. Thanks.
5823,"I really enjoyed the course, it was taught well and i had fun learning about bootstrap."
5824,Cool
5825,Excellent course. Every week the professor made an incredible effort to make it easy. I highly recommend it.
5826,Nice class
5827,Nice lecture and good for starter to learn
5828,This course was an excellent introduction into Bootstrap. It was very useful to me. The instructor was very knowledgeable and presented the subject in a very intuitive and logic manner.
5829,Awesome Course (y) Must for all beginners!!!!
5830,Recomendado
5831,Great information and structure to this course. Easy to follow along and understand the concepts. I would not be able to do the same thing just by surfing the net. 
5832,It is easy to start coding using the Bootstrap. This course provides most useful components of Bootstrap library and uses a real project to apply css and js libraries.
5833,Overall a good course
5834,Good
5835,Joggesh is a great instructor. He is very thorough in his lectures and his presentations.
5836,Nice materials and trainers. Very useful
5837,good.
5838,I learned bootstrap from this course for the first time and now i'm a full time web developer and i'm still using the course videos to get my hand on some components of bootstraps.
5839,Excellent contents!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5840,Very good. 
5841,"This course is a hit. Bootstrap is easy to use, has so many facets and applications and therefore, it's vital to understand it. Because if you understand Bootstrap, you understand HTML, CSS and at least the concept of JavaScript.Professor Jogesh manages to get all this across in a way that is focussed on a project at hand, but allows the mind to construct a complete reference and understanding for the framework as well as its underlying technologies. It is quite the feat, both as a technology and as a course."
5842,good course
5843,"great course, great instructor "
5844,great experience
5845,"i think the assignment of this course was very good and i think any one that did the assignment by himself ,have learned some good web dev skills ."
5846,Best course
5847,Well defined and covered topics.
5848,Would have like it more if JQUERY section was covered in more depth covering more examples and features.
5849,good intro to bootstrap
5850,"First, the assignments always had poor instructions. It wasn't until grading time you would find out what the criteria are. (After your assignment is submitted)Secondly, there was no documentation/help for the fact the Windows needs a webserver to run content in this section. (Many versions of Windows can't do this) Discovered/resolved over many hours, when course content would not work.The actual course content was sparse/not much to it other than Bootstrap bootstrap bootstrap. After how good the first course was/how much ground it covered, this course was frustrating, poorly documented, and a disappointment."
5851,Good course
5852,The teacher is very good! He explains very well and the material is very carefully prepared. Great Course!
5853,Really nice content. Great teacher
5854,Great introduction to Bootstrap and responsive design.
5855,"That was a great introduction to Bootstrap 3. And a big plus for introducing bower and npm. However, it is still recommended to code a serious webpage yourself after finishing this course to solidify the elusive knowledge."
5856,Good course!
5857,clear and comprehensive
5858,Excellent course which give a detail concept of web Programming.
5859,Excellent course
5860,A very good course. If you want to learn about Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools then this is the best source for you. The instructor is so awesome and his teaching methods are very comprehensive.
5861,Fantastic!
5862,very practical
5863,Excelent!
5864, Great 
5865,Really happy to getting know how bootstrap works. I have heard a lot about it but till this Course it was only magic for me.
5866,"Good content, and covered a lot in a short span of time"
5867,Excellent introduction!
5868,Very good. Thank you
5869,"Excellent course, get you working with Bootstrap very quickly and efficiently. "
5870,good
5871,I really grateful to the Coursera as well as The Hong-Kong University of Science and Technology for providing such an opportunity to learn great technologies.I am also thankful to Professor Jogesh Muppala for guiding us throughout the course. :)
5872,Excellent!!!
5873,Good lecture and assignment. Let me learn a lot of things.
5874,"At times the homework requirements are not well-detailed, comparing to the grading instructions."
5875,like this course
5876,Great course
5877,Great course
5878,Excelente thank you
5879,"I concur with others of a similar opinion on this course:Assignment instructions/criteria differ from the grading rubric criteria. Assignments mostly copy and paste. Referring people to the Bootstrap docs as reference defeats the purpose of an instructor. Many of the assignments required you to do things against best practices, like inserting inline styles to make your element look like the instructor's screenshot of his page.The last week's content seemed to be a slapdash mix of bits and pieces, and trying to inform people about Node modules via solving a quadratic equation seemed really strange. How about an example from the real world, like even an e-commerce application? (In the comments on this, the instructor said there wasn't time in this course to explain Node modules, but that he provided a clearer example in the Node.js course. Hunh? Why wouldn't you do a simpler example in the drive-by assignment?)Instructor consistently mispronounced words that are CENTRAL to the field, which just seemed weird and made me question his credibility. This might sound petty, but kuh-rooze-zel for the word Carousel? It would be like a fashion designer mis pronouncing tulle as tull-ee or bias as bye-ez.Just not impressed. I am glad my employer paid the tuition and not me. The only positive was it enforced a schedule and structure for me to try my hand at Bootstrap. I had already worked with Foundation."
5880,Muito bom. Recomendo. Foi abordado quase tudo do bootstrap.
5881,great course
5882,I love Muppala!!!
5883,Excellent course and teacher
5884,Very fun!
5885,excellent course and the Teacher is the best.
5886,"Fairly disappointing compared to the first week of this course. The balance of instruction to exercise was very low. I also resent being sent to raw Bootstrap documentation; if I could have read that, I likely wouldn't be taking the course. It makes it frustrating to jump into the exercises when the course had 5-7 minutes of lectures, 15 minutes on the exercise and then an assignment on something new.Update: I'm also impressed by Mr. Muppala taking feedback like a boss and blaming students for low reviews."
5887,"Nice courses, covering the fundamental knowledge for Bootstrap"
5888,Great Course !!
5889,Well organized course.
5890,Really useful. Thanks for everything.
5891,Good Professor. Very knowledgeable
5892,The best way to understand Bootstrap was to do a hands-on project. Professor Jogesh Muppala has done an amazing work explaining it with the project work.
5893,Top
5894,"Good Overview of Bootstrap, its usage and frameworks. "
5895,Great course ! 
5896,It nice to be building on one examples and see different ways to do it.
5897,Excellent course and instructor. I just wish the Angular course had an option to do the exercises without purchasing the course.
5898,it was a nice course and i enjoyed with the learning .
5899,Nice and helpful course
5900,"Finally I understood, how the bootstrap works! Thanks a lot!"
5901,"nice class, learnt a lot "
5902,Wonderful course and instructor!!
5903,Great course! I recommend it!
5904,The best course !
5905,The course helped a lot in making me grasp the basic understanding of bootstrap
5906, excellent 
5907,Mr Muppala is an amazing teacher and this course delivers the information you need on a need-to-know basis. 
5908,Good course to begin with Bootstrap
5909,Excellent course. In my opinion the learning materials of the last week can be divided in two weeks.
5910,Great course to learn the fundamentals of bootstrap!
5911,Very nice introduction. Very structured and good assignments.
5912,"Great professor, content and learn experience! I recommend it to everyone who is interested in the topic!"
5913,I like this course very much
5914,very good course and awesome teacher
5915,Best course for front-end developers!
5916,like this course very much. you will learn a lot
5917,"Great class, the professor has a rather interesting sense of humor which actually makes the whole experience more enjoyable. The assignments are challenging enough to make sure you learn, but are still doable within the allotted time. One recommendation from me is to use the same tools he uses in the videos (such as Brackets) as it becomes a bonus to get familiar with new development tools. "
5918,Anybody who wants to develop a basic understanding of bootstrap or node.js should take this course.
5919,Very interesting course and very pleasant Professor !
5920,Atrav??s deste curso compreendi todas as principais funcionalidades do Boostrap. 
5921,Fantastic course. It shows how we can leverage existing tools to build easily nice Front Ends
5922,Course is well presented and is very easy to understand.
5923,"I really like this course. It perfectly fit the proceeding course: HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript. "
5924,Very useful course! I feel like I have a good idea of how to use Bootstrap and am using it in all of my projects right now.
5925,Like the instructor a lot and how the course has been designed.
5926,"Great course, expand my knowledge and skills about bootstrap. Great excercise help me to understand the concept of bootstrap very well. Very recomended for who want to be a great website developer."
5927,very good!
5928,Expertly structured Course. Great learning experience.
5929,could be better
5930,I love the way the professor try to explain the concepts. I really did enjoy learning this course. I would definitely recommend this course!
5931,"Excellent introduction to Bootstrap framework. The professor does a great job explaining the main features of Bootstrap and what you need to do to get started. Also introduces other web development tools such as node.js, npm, bower, less/sass CSS preprocessors, etc.. "
5932,useful course.
5933,"This is a great course for anyone looking to take their knowledge of basic web design to a new level. I found bootstrap a little intimidating at first but this course does a great job of teaching and explaining it at a great pace. If you're new to web development and tired of making websites that look like they're from the 90s, bootstrap is a great tool to get your websites to look modern and professional. The instructor is very knowledgeable and explains things thoroughly (he's also very funny!). I recommend incorporating the additional learning materials as they will help you understand the concepts discussed in the lectures on a much deeper level. Lastly, be sure to do every exercise as they are essential to completing the assignments. Have fun!"
5934,"Good course for learning Bootstrap, delivered well by the instructor."
5935,Good Course
5936,Awesome jokes!!
5937,Very good course and very helpful.
5938,Good course to take to advance bootstrap framework knowledge.
5939,Excellent course!
5940,Good Course for bootstrap introduction
5941,the course is very good... perfect explanations and challenging assignments
5942,It gives you a lot of information about Bootstrap and various tool you can use for Front-End Web Development. It gives you hand on experience with Bootstrap and how it functions. It doesn't explain to you everything which can be a good thing or bad thing depending on how you see it. Overall it's a great course that makes you see how Web UIs are made.
5943,"This course was pretty cool. A lot of very useful stuff was covered, but I feel like it went too fast.But I think it could be better connected together in terms of broad principles, rather than just going through tons of particular examples. I still don't feel like I have a mental framework for how to lay out a web page, other than the basics of the 12-column grid system. It all seemed very ad hoc.It's by no means a bad course, and I still gave it four stars since the material is very useful, but I definitely think it could be improved upon.Also, the ratio of homework/lectures is way too low. I definitely think the course should put more emphasis on actually creating websites oneself. Many of the homework assignments took me under an hour -- after I spent hours watching all the videos and taking notes trying to remember it all."
5944,"I like the way of explanation, and good to know some more interesting things in bootstrap "
5945,"Excellent course, excellent instructor, excellent material!This course really taught me a lot."
5946,Good course covers all the basics
5947,"Excellent tutor, excellent contents in notes. In one word Outstanding"
5948,Excellent teacher and course format / materials. Teacher also makes a big effort to answer questions in the forum also. 
5949,"Easy to learn, great contents"
5950,"Solid course, very hands-on, accomplishes its goals."
5951,Good walkthru of the basics of bootstrap (and more)
5952,Excelente
5953,Great course.
5954,It's a good introduction to understand how Bootstrap works. 
5955,"Excellent course on the topic, I say. Good and detailed videos and explanations, a lot of links to improve your knowledge when / where you want to read more on topic(s) , nice and challenging enough topics for practice and checking your understanding.Thank you very much, Jogesh K. Muppala for such interesting and deep course. "
5956,Very useful course.
5957,Brilliant coursework :)
5958,Very Good
5959,"This course was very well-designed and prepared. The professor has a great way to present the material in a thorough, methodic manner. Lots of attention is given to practical exercises which are easy to follow and greatly help in digesting large amounts of material that the professor presents."
5960,Excellent course that slowly builds up a web site with exercises and assignments. Instructor has good sense of humor which makes the lectures interesting and fun. 
5961,A great course. I recommend it 
5962,very good course.Thanks 
5963,Breaks page in end.. Some of Bootstrap components were only described do this and this instead WHAT are the parts and options and WHY do we do this and that.
5964,"Great intro course that fully dives into Bootstrap and all it's capabilities. The site that you build in this course can actually be a decent addition to any portfolio for a new web designer too. I would have given it a 5/5, but I thought the course moved too slowly and rushed over explaining the available JavaScript and jQuery plugins that Bootstrap has to offer. The plugins are quite useful not just within Bootstrap, and they can be installed and customized for a range of web projects.Expect to dedicate at least 3-4 hours a week just completing the module lectures and exercises along with the homework assignment. This is not out of the ordinary though, Bootstrap does have a lot of components to cover. I truly believe Professor Muppala is the best person to do it as well. I appreciated his input in the discussion forums and thorough instruction. "
5965,"4rd assignment is tooooo easy - i expect here complicated task with non-trivial work with modules but not this child's plays.Other assignments and lectures looks good, but here is too many errors in subtitles - not critical but in every video i detect at least 1-2"
5966,Great instructor!
5967,"If you want to understand Bootstrap and, by extension, other similar front-end frameworks, then this course is for you. Prof Jogesh's light-hearted approach to teaching is very interesting and makes learning a very big fun! "
5968,It is slow. but very good.
5969,Very intresting course.Thank you so much
5970,"Mr Jogesh Muppala explains in detail and very clear how to use Bootstrap. He explains each step he does in detail, his code is easy to understand and is very helpful towards students. Thanks to him I finally understood how the grid classes in Bootstrap work."
5971,Muy completo y muy pr??ctico. Los felicito.
5972,great course
5973,"Very good introductory course. You do have to be somewhat familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript to get the most of it. The course is sometimes superficial, but it does teach you a lot in very little time. Great course!"
5974,Perfect course! Explanation is very good and the examples help you get through all assignment. 
5975,Great explanations and exercises. 
5976,Excellent teaching process which makes you really learn the material to get the grades.
5977,Nicely done and very helpful course for beginners.
5978,good
5979,Very well structured. I would recommend it to everyone who are interested in web development.
5980,Great course. Great introduction to Bootstrap.
5981,Nice course to learn bootstrap and tools very fast.
5982,Very useful course. Learned a lot about bootstrap.
5983,Very good course!
5984,Excellent course on Bootstrap. Very thorough and comprehensive.
5985,"I had used Bootstrap out of necessity in the past, picking up bits here and there. This course was excellent for filling in the gaps and giving a proper overview of Bootstrap and how it can (and should) be used for front-end development. "
5986,I found week two to really outweigh the others in terms of difficulty in the assignment but It's probably the week I learnt the most! Great Job!!
5987,Awesome teacher and course !
5988,Very intersting and exiting work please keep going.
5989,Great intro for Bootstrap with appropriate exercises. Very informative and will never go back to vanilla HTML!
5990,It was an excellent course!!
5991,"Great course, great instructor, lot of interesting material!"
5992,very interesting and course. I recommend it highly. steep learning curve
5993,"Good coverage of bootstrap, but the other parts were very briefly touched upon (nodejs, bower etc.)"
5994,Prof. Muppala is a great instructor. This was a very engaging course. 
5995,A great course.
5996,"I wish, the professor could pay more attention to from questions from students."
5997,"Great introduction to using Bootstrap properly as well as basic use of node, Less and bower"
5998,Excelente!!!!
5999,"Excellent lessons, complete and comprehensive"
6000,"I enjoyed this quite a bit. I already knew some bootstrap, but following along in this course really cemented the ideas well and showed me new views on the material."
6001,NIce Examples of bootstrap and good idea about bower library package manager and node.js
6002,Very good course on Boostrap. It was great to have an introduction to this framework. The teachers did a good job in explaining the concepts. The videos and the materials are very good.It would be great to have a follow-up course to learn more advanced stuff.
6003,An excellent course about bootstrap with excellent content videos and exercises
6004,Good explanations of all bootstrap materials.The last assignments are just too easy. 
6005,Very introductory course to Bootstrap!!
6006,Fantastic materials and great instructor!
6007,"One of the best course I have taken in Coursera. Very well structured, the professor makes every concept looks really simple. The assignments are the best part, they give us the confidence you need to start designing your own responsive front-end web application from scratch. The level is suitable for beginner and mid-level."
6008,"Its awesome course, very good for people want to learn Bootstrap, Node.js....Building website from start is a good approach.Jogesh Muppala just rocked it.Eagerly waiting for AngularJs sessions."
6009,Good learning course for new UI techniques 
6010,very comprehensive and good introduction to Bootstrap and jQuery
6011,I prefer anonymous classmates reviewing.
6012,This is so much building me from ground up.
6013,Really liked the structure of the course. Concepts were introduced gracefully. These were then well practised with detailed examples. The comments added by Professor Jogesh were quite refreshing too.
6014,Excellent course
6015,It is easy and interesting.
6016,Great course. Thanks for your time mr. Muppala :)
6017,"Course was amazing , Moreover the professor knows how to deliver the content and make it simple and easy. Good part it starts from scratch to build a web with bootstrap."
6018,Good course.
6019,Very good but should be longer
6020,I really like this course. It provides a wide aspect of bootstrap and good exercise. Learned a lot from this course.
6021,This topic and especially a whole course is mandatory for any front-end developer. Thank you!
6022,Very enjoyable course.
6023,Excellent course with useful examples. I really recommend this course.
6024,"Although the course structure and information is great, the course exercise and grading organization has a lot of space for improvement. Current structure doesn't make it possible for the learner to determine the speed. All the parts are equally important. You have to carefully go through hours of instructions. Each week and the assignment builds on what you have done before, but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations. This causes a lot of confusion.Peer evaluation rules are not shown before you submit your work. After submitting my work, I discovered that there are requirements that were not in the assignment."
6025,Excellent course. One of the best tech courses I've taken. I'm experienced in Java technologies but only back-end and Swing. And now it opens me a whole new world.I'm grateful. Thank you.The only drawback is that I really want to pay for the entire Full Web Development course but I can't find a way to pay for all the courses and keep the grades I got in the first two courses.Thank you!
6026,This is where I started to open the new beautiful world of Front-End Web Development :)
6027,The best one.
6028,"This course was awesome! I have been studying web development for quite a while--I even have several completed projects under my belt--but, this course filled in a ton of gaps in my knowledge. I expected to breeze through the material without learning much, but to my surprise, I learned something new in each lesson. Jogesh Muppala is an awesome professor. He explains things well and is very active in the course discussions. I would recommend any course he facilitates!!"
6029,Excellent course
6030,Good introduction with practice.Unfortunately no certificate of accomplishment is available. This makes the Coursera platform less interesting.
6031,Very interesting course ; the level is neither too easy nor too hard.Explanations from Jogesh are very clearThanks a lot
6032,Great class and teacher
6033,Its a good course. Covers all the basic concepts.
6034,"Nothing much to learn, the videos were rather short. There's no lecture on computing the angles and the full features of the framework. The framework wasn't updated for Swift 3."
6035,waste of time and money
6036,Why there is no minus one star? Because one star is way to much for this course. Stay away!
6037,"In this capstone project, you're given a framework to work with, and asked to create an app with pretty minimal required criteria. The problem is, there's very little instructions or support, so it feels like a classroom where the instructor said do whatever you want and walks out of the door. Overall the specialization feels ill-organized and of questionable quality, and there are plenty of negative sentiments in the forums."
6038,"After the first week, the instructors never showed up to answer a single question in the forums. The capstone project itself was disappointing, I learned much more from doing my own app in class #3.I took the Coursera Android specialization, which was eons better than this. I would not recommend this iOS specialization to anyone. I would never again take a MOOC from U of Toronto."
6039,A Wortlhy Course
6040,"This capstone project was a huge disappointment to me. The course caption stated that this would be where we would use Location, Design and Usability, and Persistence and Settings to build a high quality app. Also stated is that you???ll apply your skills to create a fully-functioning photo editing app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Earlier I have also read that we would be allowed to build an app of our choice or according to teacher's specification. That text now seems to have been removed.Anyway, none of these promises were kept. Instead we got something like 20 minutes of lectures in total for the whole four weeks, all on a simple framework to track face features. Unfortunately this framework isn't very competent, so there's only so much you can do with it. Most of us have only placed some static images and simple animations on top of the face shown in the camera view, and that is actually enough to get full marks according to the form used in the peer review. How does that even begin to fulfil the promises of the caption?We have paid as much for this course as for the previous three. There should of course be a similar amount of lectures on more advanced topics like current best practises for UI design, the Location API which was promised, and other interesting things that provide the building blocks for a state of the art iOS app. For a real cornerstone project, I expect that more than 4 weeks would be necessary in order to be able to build a good app, since many of us are doing this on our spare time.I feel sad that I had the misfortune of signing up for this course before it was made, but hope that you will take our collective criticism and make a good course out of this for future students."
6041,The capstone project had nothing to do with the previous three courses.
6042,I'm kind of disappointed with this last level. It isn't really what i expected.
6043,This is a joke.
6044,"If I could, I would rate it 0/5 stars.Do not, I repeat, DO NOT pay and enroll this course. And you will be disappointed if you do. There, now you have been warned. This part of the specialization has been put together in a haste, without effort and absolutely without any care of teaching. I'm completely shocked and disappointed.In other words:It is a complete joke and a sad excuse for a MOOC. Shame on you University of Toronto!Yes, harsh words, and here's why:The course description does not reflect the contents nor the final assignment. Face tracking? That's pretty far from what I expected from this when I paid $284 for the specialization.In total, there is only 25minutes of video lectures. Really? That's it? It's way too little for a capstone project course.Staff does not care about learners's concerns. Zero effort to respond in the discussion forums. It takes days before there is any response at all.The assignment descriptions and requirements are sparse and vague. Why are we doing face tracking when the description talks about location apis and putting it all together?"
6045,"The course has been released way too early, clearly it lacks most of its content and what does exist isn't working properly either."
6046,"Nothing much to learn, the videos were rather short. There's no lecture on computing the angles and the full features of the framework. The framework wasn't updated for Swift 3."
6047,waste of time and money

6050,A Wortlhy Course
6051,The capstone project had nothing to do with the previous three courses.
6052,"Solid introduction with a lot of references. Lot of topics are not deep enough discussed and a lot of additional reading is necessary in order to get a lot out of the course. Furthermore, the presentation style and the (language) understandability of the lecturer are not very good. Too few exercise questions. Would still recommend it as introduction course and for the high number of good paper references."
6053,Amazing!
6054,"It's an introductory course to key Pattern Discovery techniques with a comprehensive coverage of important subjects. However, it should be complemented by following the referenced material in order to obtain a wider and more complete picture of the field."
6055,Great course for beginners without experience in Python programming
6056,Should be more support in the forum for quiz and assignement
6057,"The explanations are not clear. The course is very theoretical, there's just one obligatory programming task. It's one of the worst courses I have ever enrolled in."
6058,The course exercises are medium-hard. But the topic coverage is spot on.
6059,"I'd review this course for two parts: lectures and programming assignments.Lectures: Prof. Jiawei Han is a pioneer of the subject. However, I was expecting a more indepth elaboration of techniques. In almost all his lectures he covered very crucial topics at a near-shallow level. For someone like me, it was a motivation to be learning the subject from him but I was left disappointed a little bit. I felt if i was just to gain a superficial understanding then I would have browsed through any website/blog/article rather than paying for this course and coming here under his tutelage. I will not expect him to be as thorough as he'd be in his lectures at UIUC (although why not!) but a more elaborative explanation with more notable examples (instead of pointing to the reading material at the end of 4th minute of the lecture) will be more fruitful and a better learning experience.The programming assignments are challenging and will definitely open up the thought process towards being able to imagine what patterns mean and how to go about extracting them."
6060,very nice!
6061,"I learned a lot from this lecture. And I believe the lecture is excellent except that if he could become a little bit funny, then it would be perfect. Thanks,Clark"
6062,"Really disappointing. The slides contain a lot of paper references that seem to be of high quality (that's the reason I'm giving it 2 stars and not just 1)... but the course itself is bad: it covers many algorithms, but so superficially that you learn nothing; and there are not enough programming assignments to really allow you to get any intuition on the concepts.I would love to see this be turned into a 5-course, 30-week specialization in itself (and the professor sure looks like he has the knowledge to fill these 30 weeks)... but as a single course over 4 weeks, it's not good."
6063, too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment 
6064,"I like this course. Its provides a good base for pattern discovery, with useful high level techniques, this can be used as a starting point. Something to improve can be incorporating at least one lesson with best practice coding techniques to solve the practical exercises. "
6065,The course is very helpful and brings fascinating insights for projects.
6066,"A list of research papers to read further that's it. The course is too short to cover the subject so it covers nothing in the end.The programming assignment have no help, whatsoever it's do it any language. The 2 programming assignment doesn't have much to do with the course. We don't even talk about the algo to use to do it. It looks like coursera has asked the professor to add a programming assignment to the course and he had 3 minutes to choose what it could be.It shouldn't be advertised in coursera as it is.Ah, forgot to mention that no one replies to the forums,actually no one uses them.I think the subject is very interesting but this course gives a really bad advertising to Coursera, the university and the professor.It needs more work before it's deployed on the platform.I am going to try another Coursera course in the same kind of subject I hope it won't be the same."
6067,"Solid introduction with a lot of references. Lot of topics are not deep enough discussed and a lot of additional reading is necessary in order to get a lot out of the course. Furthermore, the presentation style and the (language) understandability of the lecturer are not very good. Too few exercise questions.

6070,Should be more support in the forum for quiz and assignement
6071,The course exercises are medium-hard. But the topic coverage is spot on.
6072,"I'd review this course for two parts: lectures and programming assignments.Lectures: Prof. Jiawei Han is a pioneer of the subject. However, I was expecting a more indepth elaboration of techniques. In almost all his lectures he covered very crucial topics at a near-shallow level. For someone like me, it was a motivation to be learning the subject from him but I was left disappointed a little bit. I felt if i was just to gain a superficial understanding then I would have browsed through any website/blog/article rather than paying for this course and coming here under his tutelage. I will not expect him to be as thorough as he'd be in his lectures at UIUC (although why not!) but a more elaborative explanation with more notable examples (instead of pointing to the reading material at the end of 4th minute of the lecture) will be more fruitful and a better learning experience.The programming assignments are challenging and will definitely open up the thought process towards being able to imagine what patterns mean and how to go about extracting them."
6073,"I like this course. Its provides a good base for pattern discovery, with useful high level techniques, this can be used as a starting point. Something to improve can be incorporating at least one lesson with best practice coding techniques to solve the practical exercises. "
6074,"A list of research papers to read further that's it. The course is too short to cover the subject so it covers nothing in the end.The programming assignment have no help, whatsoever it's do it any language. The 2 programming assignment doesn't have much to do with the course. We don't even talk about the algo to use to do it. It looks like coursera has asked the professor to add a programming assignment to the course and he had 3 minutes to choose what it could be.It shouldn't be advertised in coursera as it is.Ah, forgot to mention that no one replies to the forums,actually no one uses them.I think the subject is very interesting but this course gives a really bad advertising to Coursera, the university and the professor.It needs more work before it's deployed on the platform.I am going to try another Coursera course in the same kind of subject I hope it won't be the same."
6075,Week 4 is very bad! Bad quality of video.Bad speaker.
6076,"very useful, Swift is a great program lan"
6077,"Hard and confusing, did not like this course."
6078,very good course. And trainers are expert in thier field. Thankyou. very nice experience
6079,"This is a good course in swift. The lecture videos goes into some depth, not just skim through the basics. So in that regard it's good. But the quizzes and assignment can be a bit improved. With that said, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested learning iOS development with Swift."
6080,"DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE - THE guy who reads (not teaches) the course, Justin-Nicholas Toytama is horrendous. He's too lazy to even type out the codes and has the world's most monotonous voice. He pauses often to read this notes and has 0 enthusiasm teaching this class. If this class is not part of the certificate specialization, i wouldn't even pay for this course. $64 gets you further with Nick Walter or Rob Percival's Udemy course. "
6081,Excellent!
6082,Some videos are blurring
6083,"Week 4 was particularly tough to get through. Instructor seem uninterested, and the constant hair flipping was distracting. Videos came through blurry despite using high quality settings. There was a lot of code to get through that could have been better organized. On a few occasions, I had to back-track through the videos to find something I missed. And, in one area, instructor had to go back and fix something but didn't bother to provide guidance as to were to go and do this yourself. In the end, I gave up following along with the videos and built the app using my own research."
6084,"looks like it has great contents but really hard to finish it , due to video and audio issueIn some lectures , I can't hardly read the blurry syntax and almost impossible to hear "
6085,"The video quality was so bad, can not see the code clearly. Please update the better video."
6086,"Instructor voice is too low and intro music is too high.Video quality is bad.Course content is for very beginners people, beginners to programming not only to Swift.Sorry to say it, but this course is really bad. Does not deserve to be in this specialization!"
6087,Great course. Easy to follow. 
6088,"Great overview of Swift - nice, challenging assignments. Instructors explain concepts well in videos."
6089,"would love to have this course in 2 sessions, instead of one, "
6090,Good. Week 4 was very challenging.
6091,you can take the assignments only if you pay
6092,"very useful, Swift is a great program lan"

6098,Good. Week 4 was very challenging.
6099,Great course in NLP which provides a broad overview of the topic. The programming assignments can make you confident in solving NLP-based problems in business applications.
6100,Its a tough course but worth it!More in depth details will be much better.Coding Assignments can be explained much better. In this course there is problem in understanding coding assignment details as in some cases they are not explained correctly.
6101,"The professor spews the material like reading poetry. The material is disorganized jumping from one topic to another and back. The quizzes are just plain dumb containing questions like what article was written by authors x, y, z. The homework is barely related to the material and one of them, the one that made me abandon wasting further time with this class consists of wasting a huge amount of time (days) configuring parameters and running an application over and over again to tune them(waiting up to ten minutes on my i7 machine to make one pass over the data). My impression is that this guy didn't spend any time to prepare this course and just used the material/homework from a more advanced class that he did previously. You will not learn almost anything by taking this class, as none of the topics is explained well and is the opposite of self contained. Just a huge waste of time..."
6102,"I got very good introduction not only for NLP but also for other adjacent topics like ML, probability theory, linear algebra. Highly recommend if you want to get involved in these topics."
6103,An ambitious sweep across the NLP landscape. Requires at least intermediate knowledge of Python; especially the programming assignments are barely doable without advanced debugging skills. Exercises often refer to material not covered in the course up to that point.
6104,"Although the course seems to be very interesting and cover wide spectrum of NLP subjects, it is full with references to other materials some of them are no longer exist in the location given. Also the programming exercises quite often are detached from the material and also have references to materials that were not covered in lectures accompany them.My advice to author - made lectures and exercises more self-contained. Do not try to cover enormous amount of material during one week. Make exercised to be closely connected to the material given during that week."
6105,"The content is important and the course goes through a great extension of the NLP topics but the methodology is bad. The video lectures are often overcharged with many different varieties of a processing method that is not well explained. The quiz are often not well related to the lecture and the assignments are badly explained and there's no much documentation related to them. Comparing to Andrew's ML course, this one is really bad."
6106,"After about week 6, helpfulness decreased quite a lot.."
6107,"I found the topics well chosen, providing an good overview of techniques used for NLP. The introduction to NLP was a bit long, assuming that people who take this course know what NLP is about and why it is difficult for computers. However my main critics is the lengthy programming exercises that were badly described. I spend a significant amount of time just to try to figure out what to do. It required reading of papers and chapters of books to understand the algorithms. I missed the formulas and methods in the lecture notes. A little bit more technical details in selected topics (that are used today) and less of a broad overview of historical approaches would earn 5 stars from me."
6108,"Great overview of many of the most important topics of NLP. Practical examples and exploration of different approaches for each task (from first attempts to state of the art) make it easier to understand and absorb the theoretical content, while acquiring insight for concrete applications. "
6109,The course skims through loads of topics .Need to go deep in some of them.
6110,Recommended for new users who want to learn NLP.
6111,"A lot of good information, but I found it hard to retain most of it without a less dry style of presentation. Assignment were quite hard, and instructions were a bit too sketchy."
6112,"It's more towards teaching linguistics and theoretical concepts. I understand that is also required to understand the subject. However, I was expecting more practical training on coding different programs with various ways. I suggest to introduce a balance in theory concepts and practical training."
6113,"I don't have the impression that much effort was invested in this class to present natural language processing as introductory as possible for beginners in this field, i.e. someone who not necessarily has a background in computational linguistics. "
6114,"The assignments were not well supported by the lecture material, which were much to shallow. I guess an Intro level course is going to be broad and shallow, but if you are going to have assignments that require implementation then that should be better supported by the material. And don't even get me started on the final..."
6115,"Excellent introductory course. The programming exercises were all interesting and helpful, actually, I think the course could include more programming exercises and video quizzes."
6116,Content is not well adapted to a digital format.
6117,"I really like the course, would recommend to have more assignments."
6118,"Very challenging course, but I enjoy it"
6119,Very good introductory course on natural language processing. 
6120,"This course SEEMS to be a great course. But personally I think it's not.It talks about so many things but none of them are explained clearly. I can't get the picture of this field clearly.The assignment looks nice. But it's not. First, it's not well-organized. Sometimes you need to look at next week's course to do this week's quiz. The programming assignment is VERY VERY unsatisfying. It's not explained clearly; there's no helpful instruction; and it is very confusing. You need to spend hours and hours just UNDERSTANDING what you need to do. And some algorithms are not even told in the course and you need to implement them! I know this could be a good exercise but I would hope it at least provide some useful resources.Generally, I am very disappointed. I feel like I'm spending hours and hours but learning nothing. Just confusion. Please consider reformat the homework; make it more doable for new learners in this field."
6121,Nice introductory course.
6122,wonderful courses
6123,Very helpful.
6124,interesting 
6125,too much of introduction. can easily cut down of that. when you first listen to it - there is no way to remember all the details

6142,Enjoyed this one. Always wanted over-engineer the project. So keep it simple if you want to succeed!
6143,Very good course specialization. You can learn a lot if following closely. They gonna have to modify the course using Angular 2 in order to be relevant to the newest/modern framework. 
6144,"It's very time consuming, but it's worth it! It's when you put all the concepts learned in the previous courses, and with this, the bugs also come altogether.A tip: Scale down your idea, because the time may not be enough!"
6145,"Dear Instructors;Thank you for the excellent course and the great sessions you provided. Keeping a combination of technology, professionalism and humor in your sessions was always a great experience and brought smile to my face when following your instructions. I believe keeping this spirit in your courses will be of great help and fun for all students. Wish you well in your future teachings and online courses and hope to follow more of them in the future.Kind regards;M.Karami"
6146,Great overall experience. I found it quite flattering that someone who's final submission I had to grade sent in the exact same paper I sent in and provided the same links I provided to an API on areascore.ca (which is a domain I own) as well as links to repositories in my bitbucket account (which I now have made private). The only thing that would upset me is this person getting a better grade than I did. 
6147,"I feel grateful that I found this course. This course is my first step as a learner in Coursera and it helps me to learn the fundamental skill that I need for my thesis, which is about CRM mobile application.

6150,Excellent course. I would recommend to everyone willing to boost your career to a new level.
6151,"Very interesting, but when presenting the work, the script offered for each report gives a somewhat sparse information.

6152,That was a great experience!
6153,"The course is well structured and Prof Muppala presents it in an interesting way. The range of technology covered was good and would be useful. The CapStone Project timelines are not realistic at all - one has to start implementing almost from the word go, the artificial interim reports are distracting if one does not realize that and I think many students are forced to a second session to complete the course.

6175,"Liked the course, below are the specific points:Pros:1. Good introduction to Social media analytics2. Good demonstration about the packages used for this analysis for Python and R, before this course I didn't know about Tweepy, NLTP, textblob etc. to do the analysis directly3. The assignments were not too difficult, sometimes faced challenges due to code not working or data availability. ( The Yelp data set needed in Week 3 is about 10 GBs!)4. Course is not too difficult or time intensive to finish or work onCons:its just an introduction towards Social media analytics, do not expect much.You will not be taught the introduction and work around for python and R, although the course says that you do n't need to know the programming languages to work, but if you don't know then you are in trouble. Many times code will not work or you will not be able to convert the file or save the file as instructed in the videos, so expect a good proportion to be spent on Internet searching for solutions.The community is almost dead, All the 4 weeks I faced problems in my code because I am from non programming background and so I posted on the forums but got exactly 0 replies from the Instructor and the Course staff. As a result, I had to resort to internet search and trial and error for running the provided codes since I am not a hardcore programming guyThe course is fun to learn and get introduction to data analytics but don't expect to go and apply these concepts in your organization. Reason? they don't tell you how to get big amounts of data for your organization or the professional social media data providers available who provide large amount of data to organizations to do analysis on. If you want to run an analysis of 50 tweets or 25 you tube videos then its fine anything more than that? Good luck trying to mine Youtube video for 2000-3000 videos or 10,000-20,000 tweets ( which is the minimum amount you will need to run an analysis on and get the correct results) through Python and free APIs Overall, a fun introductory way to know about Social media analytics but don't expect too much and do not expect to be a social media data scientist through this course.

6176,Very useful to learn the basics of social media analysis (twitter and youtube) with python and R.It's a good course to start.
6177,"The course material should be provided on coursera itself. Instead of having to download a 1.8GB dataset from yelp, the two files could have been shared here. "
6178,"A good, basic introduction to Social Media Data Analytics"
6179,"I'd like to give just one star rating for this course, as it is very far from what I expected. The course expect students to know Python, to know R, but did not go deep enough to help students understand the insight from social media data. In fact, lots of R task can be replaced with Python, so the course could be designed in a much better way that students do not always switch between two programming environments. This course mainly teaches how to download data with keywords, and how to plot graph, not worth the effort of learning. Therefore, I would not recommend this course to anyone."
6180,"Far from being a real course, it need polishing, at this point it looks more like a basic tutorial with a few error, perhaps next versions will be better. "

So I would suggest our teacher , to summarize the main points of those interview in a better way . "
6200,"Excellent course providing not only the knowledge of algorithms but also useful insights into developing and maintaining recommender systems.

6214,"It's a good introduction to mobile app development; however, the class is unmaintained. Since 2014 when the videos and lectures were written, the frameworks have advanced and become incompatible with the lessons. Links in the lessons to documentation do not give useful information because they're for the wrong version of the framework. Still worth taking, but as a paid class I have higher expectations. "
6215,"Great course, great materials, great technologies."
6216,"Muito bom, com os exerc??cios e as explica????es, fica f??cil de aprender"
6217,"Wow! Is developing an app THIS simple if I know Angular! This course and the way it proceeds in each step gave me a lot of confidence that developing an android app is simple.I haven't started anything yet (I did not do the exercises), but the fact that I know. It is easy is a good enough take home from this course."

6220,"Great lessons, learned a lot, love it, appreciate!"
6221,Excellent course
6222,"Excellent. A bit long in terms of duration and explanation, but at the end you end up learning and understanding the concepts well. Finally after many attempts I have been able to learn Ionic."
6223,Best course by best Instructor.
6224,Great course with lots of technologies evolved.
6225,So funny and really interestanting if you want to learn mobile app movil in few steps.
6226,Yeah!
6227,"Bad video quality, errors in tasks and descriptions, no clear path through the course."
6228,Awesome course and especially awesome faculty teaches all the concept so well and adds some humor as well very satisfied :)
6229,"Doesn't provide as much of an in-depth info as I was expecting, but its a good course to get you started with hybrid app development. "
6230,"Really good course, learned a lot of hybrid development"
6231,"Great course indeed, can recommend it to anyone interested in mobile development"
6232,Very interesting and useful course for web mobile development! I recommend it! 
6233,Very interesting course
6234,"Some things are not updated. Some things should be reviewed deeper. It is a good course to start developing hybrid apps, but should be updated."
6235,"Platform tooling for emylators and native devices is tricky and if done wrong, it impacts a students ability to finish the course. However these topics get very little attention."
6236,"As always, a great course!"
6237,nice class!
6238,Very Informative and well defined!
6239,"A well organised course with increasingly interesting exercises and assignments that really help you to understand the Ionic platform. Additionally, the lecturer has a great sense of humour which makes the course just that much better."
6240,Excellent course!!!
6241,Awesome course
6242,Awesome course
6243,Very good
6244,very nice
6245,This course gave me the key concepts and technologies for mobile programming
6246,A lot of outdated information. A lot of mistakes. But still a good way to understand the basics.
6247,verry good
6248,"Thank you for this course, it's very good to develop mobile application with IONIC FRAMEWORK."
6249,great course
6250,Great course about developpement for multiplatform mobil app (ios/android). 
6251,"good tutorial, I wish there is more detail of how to setup the plugin and stuffs. "
6252,This is definitely a must for everyone seeking to learn mobile hybrid app development
6253,Great course really enjoyable and informative. 
6254,Nice and straightforward. Perfect if you want to get an Ionic app up and running and already know angularjs.
6255,Wonderful Course!
6256,Great knowledge is obtained here! I begin to really understand the value of JS in our lives :)
6257,Excelente
6258,"Thanks a lot, that was a great course"
6259,All is very clear and assignments were very well for improving my understanding.Thank you.
6260,Supremely well explained. Thank you teacher.
6261,show
6262,Great course!
6263,nice course for the beginner to developing mobile app by html/ css/ js skill
6264,I liked the course very much. Learnt a lot of new things.
6265,Awesome information provided 
6266,Great Course as always!
6267,Very good course. Most of the new features and technologies were well explained. Maybe a little more hands-on exercise will not be a bad idea.
6268,"Nice one, really unique"
6269,"The structure of the course is awesome, and the instructor is fantastic. Am enjoying his teaching approaches. Keep up the good work. "
6270,"It??s a very good course, but when we get to the part of really generating the app, I had a lot of problems that were not covered in the course. "
6271,"amazing course, recommended "
6272,It's hard to setting up development environment correctly 
6273,"While the subject matter was extremely relevant, I didn't think this course was taught well. Much of the lecture and exercise focused on providing direction than actually teaching. I felt as though I was just copying and pasting sample code. At times it was as though the professor was rushing to introduce new modules rather than discussing how and why certain concepts should be used. In most cases, I could have learned the Ionic modules just as well by reading the documentation and looking at sample code, which is often what this course felt like. I'd have much rather seen the concepts explained in more detail than rushing to add new modules without any context.The quizzes are not challenging (the professor always puts the correct answer as the first choice) and the exercises just provide cut/paste code snippets without any reasoning or explanation. I would have preferred to have the exercises conducted by providing a high level goal and then a solution to check against rather than the put this code here approach that's used. The assignment grading is either far too obvious (whether a required module was injected or not) or completely arbitrary. Generally the assignments lacked nuance and complexity as well. I didn't feel like I really learned any of the concepts behind this material after going through the course."
6274,So far so good!
6275,"Wonderful course, a complete introduction guide for new hands. "
6276,Last section with the emulators needed more guidance on how to install. I received few errors just trying to install the platforms emulators in my pc
6277,"??timo curso! Did??tico, coeso e claro. "
6278," For all the many courses I took on Coursera, this course is one of the best. "
6279, Definitely recommended. Prof is as always amazing. Explains concepts well and gives excellent examples. Exercises are top-notch as well. 
6280,"It began with the basics of Ionic and it ended with an APK that I've installed on my phone! This MOOC is a life changing one, It includes a lot of amazing extra resources that you can learn from and the exercises were very important in helping me understand all the concepts taught. It also encouraged me to go there and try many ngCordova plugins on my own."
6281,Cannot be better than this.hatz off to professor.
6282,is great
6283,"The course could be explained much more in depths. Certain concepts are explained on the surface and remained not so clear. The teacher is very nice, however, he could explain the material in much easier way"
6284,Great course
6285,Love the course and the prof is awesome!
6286,Its good 
6287," Best full stack courses, you can even understand how Angular works better"
6288,"Excellent course, and a delight to learn from the Prof. giving the lectures . Thank you"
6289,"Excelente es de lo mejor, recomendado 100% "
6290,Not as good as previous courses from this specialization
6291,Excellent 
6292,excellent course
6293,Good course!!!
6294,A massive thanks to Prof. Muppala - this course provides a very gentle and easy to access entry into the world of app development. I tried to get into Android Studio and Xcode before and was overwhelmed by both - taking this approach made it a lot easier for me to get started and the course layout (especially in conjunction with the previous course about AngularJS) provided me with just the right tools and concepts at the right time and pace!
6295,Excellent course. This was a great intro to hybrid app development. The specialization has been building gradually to this point and everything learned so far has been helpful in grasping the concepts for this course. 
6296,"Quite comprehensive, entertaining course. Unfortunately, not being able to submit the assignments without paying a fee is rather offputting - Especially taking into account we're talking about peer-to-peer reviews"
6297,Not too difficult
6298, Excelent! 
6299,Very nice course
6300,Top
6301,"Good course, but the development cycle is hard and I had to suffer a lot when it comes to the device emulations . I know the time is short, but I would be happy if you can provide a course or some helpful links. The first two weeks are nice to develop, because of the ionic serve --watch. "
6302,very good.
6303,"Great classes, awesome teacher. Hands on, straight to the point.... A++++ "
6304,Thank you good course
6305,Excellent. The whole specialisation is excellent. Good balance between theory and practice. 
6306,Wonderful course and a wonderful professor / teacher
6307,Excellent course! Informative theoretical course and great practical exercises.
6308,"Lo recomiendo altamente :) Curso muy completo, recomendable seguir la secuencia de los primeros cursos para entenderlo mejor."
6309,Excellent! Especially seeing how easy to convert existing website developed in previous courses using Bootstrap and/or AngularJS to an Android or iOS application.
6310,The teacher is great. Everything is very well explained.
6311,Realy good
6312,??timo curso!??timo conte??do!??timo instruto!
6313,"The lectures and assignments dealing with Ionic were useful and informative, but that's only the first half of the course. The Android/iOS portion felt extremely rushed. For all of the hassle of setting up my Android environment, I get one week of lectures/exercises out of it and that only covers rudimentary functionality."
6314,Remarkable.
6315,Great course. Ionic rules!
6316,Both the specialization and the course are top quality. Professor Muppala is the best!
6317,Recommended for any learner - I'm in awe of the professor and how he neatly explains everything at a clear pace.
6318,"Sometimes It's not so easy to finish some assignments, but you must to do it again and again. Great amount of useful information"
6319,A very good course for familiarizing yourself with Hybrid Mobile Development. Teaches you the basics and some good features that comes with the Hybrid Mobile App Development.
6320,Great course.
6321,I had the opportunity to learn in an very organized course.Thanks.
6322,As always Professor Muppala presents a well structured and detailed course. Excellent!
6323,"I can't just rating and didn't write a preview. Because this course is so useful and have a great lecturer. What I like most is, the exercise, the assignment is so really EXCITING and make me want to learn more about whole MEAN stack. Biggest thank's for the Lecturer. Really recommended for you who still reading and don't want to purchase this course. Because this is really WORTH it! Thank you. God Bless you!"
6324, Great 
6325,Awesome!
6326,The material is not mature yet. Some things were not tested by the teacher before being part of the course and do not actually work. Questions asked on the forums about it got no answers before the end of the course.
6327, Excellent introduction! 
6328,"This course serves as a great introduction to mobile web development. Notice that multiplatform in this case means iOS and Android (no Windows Phone) and you do get a bit of hands on work on Android SDK and XCode, although mostly for setting up both environments. Professor Muppala is again outstanding in the class, covering a wide range of topics combined with multiple exercises which in my case really furthered my understanding. One thing I believe could improve would be having either at least one assignment forcing you to deploy to Android and another one to iOS. In my case, it was just too comfortable to simply deploy to an iOS device and barely look at Android. Also, the vibration function should not be part of an assignment, as not everyone will have a device to test it and neither of the emulators really use it. One final recommendation for those pressed with time: I was able to follow Professor Muppala quite easily while playing the lectures at 1.75x (it's funny how slow he seems to speak when I set in back to 1x :-) )."
6329,Good
6330,I got the feeling that we ran through the material and did not spend ample time setting up the testing and understanding the environment. Maybe the course need to be two weeks to cover this properly. 
6331,Best course in the specialization so far!
6332,"Great course.Thank you everyone, the teacher,the university and the Coursera team for providing a valuable course."
6333,"good course indeed, but should have information about places we can fin help especially parts where we run emulators."
6334,One the best I ever had been enrolled.Thank you very much :D
6335,"Great course, lots of learning and lots of fun. Some frustrations, but once you overcome that, is even more fun"
6336,Great
6337,Inovator
6338,I took the initial offering of this courser. It is an excellent class that I am sure will only improve over time. Prof. Muppala is a wonderful instructor and I learned so much in this course. My only suggestion would be to clarify some of the grading details as there were some questions on certain items in the last assignment. I would definitely recommend this series of courses and I am looking forward to taking the final course in this Full Stack Web Development series.
6339,Muito bom. S?? acho que a aplica????o constru??da no curso poderia ser uma melhor e independente dos cursos anteriores.
6340,great course
6341,"Again, amazing :)"
6342,A well explained with good support course! I recommend this to everyone interested in the field. Note: I would want to know how to move further with the app and introduce it inside app store and google play store. This is omitted in the course. I am looking forward for this course updates if there will be any - and I think it will be improved!
6343,Fun and useful
6344,Awesome!!!!
6345,"Good course, although felt like it didn't quite cover enough fundamental material concerning Ionic framework and how it sits within the scope of the specialization. "
6346,I like this.
6347,Awesome course. The instructor is analytical and clear and the assignments are just great.
6348,Excellent course.
6349,Its really a very interesting and well though out course and the prof is knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches. I have personally become hooked up to Prof Muppala's courses.see you in Server Side soon.
6350,Course was great. I learnt so many things in less time. Thank you professor Muppala
6351,Excellent course and would recommend it to anybody
6352,Awesome course!!
6353,A pity that the submission are now blocked for not paying students.
6354,Good helpful course. 
6355,Good course.Unfortunately the last week's worth of material wasn't particularly insightful or useful.
6356,really great coursei wish it had automatic test to assignment results
6357,excellente course. Going to the 5 course on this specialization.. Thanks Jogesh K. Muppala. See you again.
6358,Really great course to learn the basics of building a mobile app using the Ionic framework and Cordova
6359,"By learn through the courses without submit the assignments. The course was still very impressive and easy to learn, thanks proffessor! See you in next course."
6360,Awesome course
6361,"Definitely a five star course. I followed the professor in the Full Stack Specialization. He was always knowledgeable and helpful, as well as full of senses of humor. "
6362,Great course !
6363,Good.
6364,"I am taking this course now, It is amazing to be able to develop IOS and Android Mobile apps and the same time. A good tip, you need to see the previous course about angular to understand better this about Ionic."
6365,"Would have given full, but the assignments are paid..like WTF!!!"
6366,very good :)
6367,Really good and practical course. It helps you reinforce the knowledge that you got from the three previous courses.
6368,The teacher is really good and you can see that they are doing a fantastic job with all the specialization 
6369,"Course Content and everything was good, video lectures have some disturbance please delete that noise."
6370,Should use ionic 2!
6371, Excelente 
6372,"Great course, great materials, great technologies."
6373,Enjoyed this course less than the other courses in the series. Needs to be refreshed and updated.

6457," I found this course very informative, it expanded to me the landscape of cyber security."
6458,very boring. Just reading from slides. 
6459,Excellent
6460,"This is not a class for a non-computer scientist or a non-electrical engineer. It's frustrating to learn the material this way, but the information is valuable."
6461,Only two stars because of poor quality of videos.
6462,"Audio quality is very poor, this makes it very difficult to understand, sometimes impossible to understand the professor which is not a native eanglish speaker. His mispronunciation and strugle with words combined with low audio volume makes it almost imposible to understand at times."
6463,"The course gives a very high level overview of hardware security and does not go into particular details. Understandably, hardware labs are not included in this online course and the only practice is basic boolean and modular algebra. Quality of the media and transcripts can be improved. Sound is very low and noisy in some videos which makes it hard to watch on a mobile device. Some videos seems to be cut of too early and week's 6 videos are out of order, which is annoying. Overall it's an okay overview of the topic for someone who is unlikely to apply it at daily job (e.g. software engineer like myself)."
6464,"Course contents was good , assignments were challenging . One suggestion is to provide pdf for each classroom session or may be a weekly pdf would be great , It so happened that attending each quiz without pdf it was hard to search from video/transcript back and forth"
6465,Wow! Great and accessible introduction to HW security. 
6466,"A lot of it wasn't comprehensible. Also, I may have not been well prepared for it. I should have tried to learn of the background required for this course."
6467,I enjoyed this course and I learn many things
6468,Great overviez on Hardware Security
6469,"foreign accent is totally ok, but very poor presentation skills by lecturer. material should be refreshed some already outdated "
6470,It was a very nice course. Lots of exposure was given to mathematical ways of analyzing threat.
6471,Complete course in order to have a clear overview of HW security. I would recommend it to all HW engineers or System Engineers as well.
6472,If you really serious about security - you have to start with your hardware...
6473,"The most boring course i have ever done in my life... Soporific course, Content interesting, but professor is just reading slides, with reading mistakes every 2-3 words. I would not recommend this course at all."
6474,"Poor presentation skills (mostly reading slides)Unclear and inconsistent in what pre-requisite knowledge is needed for the course (in one place he assumes one does not know digital logic, but then later he assumes you know hardware languages, fpga design, etc.).Was a waste of time, shame on Coursera that pre-requisite knowledge was removed from the site."
6475,Very slow paced and boring. The instructor is not good at teaching.
6476,"It is a great intro course with very rich information about hardware security. But just as some other students have mentioned, the difficulty level of each assignment is not well balanced, and Week 6 videos are out of order. "
6477,"Excelente curso, para alguien que estudia electr??nica le ayudar?? a ver un enfoque en seguridad."
6478,"Some content is good and informative but there's a big problem with the teacher accent (adding a ch at the end of half the words) and his diction (hesitating on the other half the words). Also it seems that the course was created in a rush and lacks a lot of polishing(*). Sometimes the course assumes a good level in computer science and then 2 minutes later it explains how to do a decimal to binary conversion! This makes many videos boring but the slides are not provided so you really have to view the videos entirely. I've followed much harder courses with pleasure but here it was torture to finish it. Also most of the course is just definitions of some specific terms and not practical explanations. I agree that defining a few words is important but here it's just too much. *: Some videos are in reverse order, some are stopped in the middle of a sentence, some quizzes are bugged and don't give credit properly and there's nobody to help students..."
6479,"The audio can be difficult to understand. Partially because of the Professor's accent and partially because the recording is poor. If you can get past that, it's a good course and the professor knows his stuff."
6480,The material used for this course is so old that makes me feel I'm taking a course in the 90's. The narration is very dull and therefore hard to follow. Really disappointing. 
6481,"The quality of the slides, video, and presentation in this course is much lower than those offered by this Speciality or coursera in general. Very disappointed in this."
6482,The content is rich but the way of teaching is dull.
6483," I found this course very informative, it expanded to me the landscape of cyber security."

6491,"A lot of it wasn't comprehensible. Also, I may have not been well prepared for it. I should have tried to learn of the background required for this course."
6492,I enjoyed this course and I learn many things
6493,Great overviez on Hardware Security
6494,"foreign accent is totally ok, but very poor presentation skills by lecturer. material should be refreshed some already outdated "
6495,It was a very nice course. Lots of exposure was given to mathematical ways of analyzing threat.
6496,Complete course in order to have a clear overview of HW security. I would recommend it to all HW engineers or System Engineers as well.
6497,"The most boring course i have ever done in my life... Soporific course, Content interesting, but professor is just reading slides, with reading mistakes every 2-3 words. I would not recommend this course at all."
6498,Very slow paced and boring. The instructor is not good at teaching.
6499,"It is a great intro course with very rich information about hardware security. But just as some other students have mentioned, the difficulty level of each assignment is not well balanced, and Week 6 videos are out of order. "
6500,"Excelente curso, para alguien que estudia electr??nica le ayudar?? a ver un enfoque en seguridad."
6501,"Some content is good and informative but there's a big problem with the teacher accent (adding a ch at the end of half the words) and his diction (hesitating on the other half the words). Also it seems that the course was created in a rush and lacks a lot of polishing(*). Sometimes the course assumes a good level in computer science and then 2 minutes later it explains how to do a decimal to binary conversion! This makes many videos boring but the slides are not provided so you really have to view the videos entirely. I've followed much harder courses with pleasure but here it was torture to finish it. Also most of the course is just definitions of some specific terms and not practical explanations. I agree that defining a few words is important but here it's just too much. *: Some videos are in reverse order, some are stopped in the middle of a sentence, some quizzes are bugged and don't give credit properly and there's nobody to help students..."
6502,"The audio can be difficult to understand. Partially because of the Professor's accent and partially because the recording is poor. If you can get past that, it's a good course and the professor knows his stuff."
6503,very good for learners
6504,I found that there were a lot of mathematical function in this course. I need to see the examples of how are those functions applied in the real programming which support the business.
6505,"Very well mounted course.For the majority of the topics explained, focused on techniques, not jut on theory.Good suplemental lectures listed."
6506,More programming assignments would have helped understanding the topics covered in the course better.
6507,A very useful course! thanks prof.
6508,"It?? a geat course, and the teacher shared his knowlege"
6509,It's worth to learn!
6510,"Interessant, but it wasn't organized too well. Some questions referred to topics which came in the next lesson"
6511," Too much theories ,I hope the professor add more programming assignment."
6512,"Very good course, but could have something practical."
6513,great introductory course for IR 
6514,"The course was great. What I had a real problem with was the lack of response for problems with the Honors programming assignments. I never received any feedback from the TA's and when I submitted to MeTa support, they said the school design the programs so they can't help. I got a Segmentation Fault on Assignment one which I never did get resolved. Because of this, I was unable to get the Honors status. "
6515, Great!
6516,excellent material and great explanations! The main problem here is that quizzes will sometimes cover subjects not introduced until the following week. 
6517,This course is really great but the programming assignments need to be updated. 
6518,thanks
6519,Great course for those trying to understand how ro analyse and process text data. It has the right amount of tools to help you understand the basics of information retrieval and search engines.
6520,Ok. It was a rerun and there wasn't much help in the Forum and there were too few exercises. But it was really interesting.
6521,The explanation is detailed and clear. But the missing star is because I hoped the course would have programming assignments using popular language as python.
6522,Good survey of techniques
6523,A great overview of text retrieval methods. Good coverage of search engines. A longer course will cover search engine better (remember this is a 6 weeker)
6524,"The videos could not be too longer than they actually are. If this change, could be done, the student or user could have more time to dig into the assignments problems and even read more textbooks related to the main topic."
6525,"Excellent ! Well organized, presented with aptitude to detail. Definitely will recommend and take further units in this specialization. Thanks Prof"
6526,Excellent Introduction to Text Retrieval and Search Engines technologies.
6527,much help for deep understanding of TR
6528,like it.
6529,The course is interesting and you can learn a lot. The professor is very knowledgeable in the area of search engines. However the course goes very early into mathematical details without too much context. The programming assignments are great and I would focus more on them as they really show you how the engine works. 
6530,"Love the way the professor introduces the concepts, doesn't overwhelm the student!"
6531,thanks
6532,"This is not a class I would normally pursue. I took it as part of the Data Mining certification. That being said, this class was wonderful. I learned the basics of text retrieval and search engines. I went from knowing nothing, to having a working sense of how search engine algorithms work. It was a challenging course for me, but very much worth the time and effort I put into it. It was like pulling back the curtain on the code behind Google, Netflix, and Amazon searches, and that has made me think of the world in a different way. I am now a human happily collaborating with machine learning systems. Thank you!!"
6533,Very good course for someone who wants to understand how text retrieval works. 
6534,This course is complemented with a software and text (not mandatory) and good explanation with diagrams... 
6535,"Very theoretical and somewhat dry. If you are interested in applied machine learning techniques (for text retrieval and analysis) this is not really the course to take. Gives a solid background though which, in my opinion, every aspiring data analyst needs."
6536,Great insights in this course... I learned so much!!
6537,"The material is compelling and the lecturer is engaging, but the course is not well prepared. The assessments are not relevant to the material covered and there are no collateral materials (e.g., downloadable slides/handouts) available to assist in learning."
6538,It is an excellent trending topic!
6539,very good for learners
6540,I found that there were a lot of mathematical function in this course. I need to see the examples of how are those functions applied in the real programming which support the business.

6561,Great insights in this course... I learned so much!!
6562,A great academic challenge!
6563,Great
6564,Wonderful course 
6565,Really good introduction to regression models. 
6566,Great course!
6567,"One of the better classes of the specialization. I found the quizzes quizzes (in particular week 3 and 4) quite challenging. I took the ML class before, which I do not recommend. Take this class before the ML class."
6568,"Awesome course. Handling a complex topic in a very lucid manner. However, be prepared of finishing in more than 1 class because it will really take time to grasp the concepts especially if you are not from statistical background. Great job Brian."
6569,Exceptional Learning!
6570,good intro
6571,well done!
6572,Really helpful and well presented.
6573,"Not impressed. Dr. Caffo tried to use non-calculus, non-linear-algrebra ways to explain complex concepts and derivations. IMO, he should not have done that. It only made things more confusing. Also the final project is so unsatisfactory in that we were to analyze the data with 32 obs but 11 variables! How robust could it be? Was expecting something much more challenging than that."
6574,Complicated but good information!
6575,Nicely presented and understandable course with a challenging an interesting project. 
6576,Good
6577,I think this is the best course I have ever came across in the coursera. Everything is discussed in the most simple manner with great depth.
6578,Some lab work (swirl()) did not match the material presentation order. Essential coursework delivered at a blistering pace. Good Stuff. 
6579,Very Good Course !
6580,"With the first few videos, I was concerned I would be re-living the nightmare that was the Statistical Inference course. (I gave a long review of that one. To summarize Statistical Inference: I hated it. But I learned things. Those things stuck. I used them in real life. That's good.)But wow, after getting through this course, I loved it. Very practical and useful stuff. It had me thirsting for more information and I found myself reading unassigned material. I became particularly interested in Anova and continuing to read up on it even though I am done the course.I would take this course again. I would recommend it to those wanting to learn more about data science. It's got some quirks and room for improvement, but overall it's a good course. "
6581,"Great course, although feeling as always a bit rushed on the last lectures. At least it makes you want to investigate more about the subject.I find frustrating however not to have a proper instructor example of the final assignment, it is hard to review other participants work and realize what they / you have done wrong without actually knowing how best the assignment should have been fulfilled.And as all courses in this specialization, there is not much interaction between participants, and not much effort by mentors to animate it"
6582,"Slightly better than the Statistical Inference course, but many of the same technical and delivery defects persist. With an otherwise high quality program, I recommend re-producing the inference and regression lectures to increase the overall value of the curriculum."
6583,2 thumbs up
6584,"Good course on the theories behind regression, followed by significant applications and how to use them in R. Lectures are very dry, but the information within them is very useful."
6585,Great introduction to regression models. Pretty clear
6586,"The concepts are well explained and precise. I think it depends on the individual to dive deeper into the topic by independent learning. Good data examples. Also following the suggested book of the author helps with some extra excercises. However , I feel extra practice questions would help ."
6587,"Good foundation in the Data Science Certification for Practical Machine Learning. There are 3 areas that I would like to dig deeper so far: Statistical Inference, Regression Models and Practical Machine Learning (perhaps + Deep Learning)."
6588,Lots of material needs additional study (from different sources) as it's only summarily explained. Much math without the link to the praxis :-(
6589,Very Challenging CourseVery well presented Great material/source of information for study Loved It !
6590,"In-depth and detailed, this one month course will provide aspirants with the knowledge and skills required to conduct efficient regressions."
6591,"Once again an excellent course, thank you!"
6592,"A very intense course, where a lot of concepts are introduced. In order for all the new information to be metabolized, it took me much more than four weeks."
6593,"This course has been the most difficult in the Dara Science track so far, but you get a more in depth knowledge in data analysis and interpretation based on statistical models."
6594,"This course was an improvement in teaching modality from the statistical inference course, with more polished content, but the link between the lectures and the actual exercises was still a bit strained. Overall, it felt like there was a bit of a disconnect between the swirl exercises and the lectures, and this led to a lot of self-teaching."
6595,Many things are not clear enough in multivariable regression part.
6596,"Amazing course, I learnt a lot."
6597,Very good material but often too fragmentend/messy. The notes would need re-writing.
6598,"This course is great, if you want to get into it. This was the first time I have been exposed to linear and generalized linear regression. I was overwhelmed by so much information and knowledge that I needed extra time to understand and to bring the pieces from week 1 to week 4 together. The peer reviews weren't (in my case) not very helpful. I missed concrete feedback on my approach and the result. I would have appreciated some kind of assurance that the achieved results are of quality and on the level of data scientist. "
6599,"Important material, poorly taught."
6600,Great Course
6601,Content regarding variable selection is kind of rough.
6602,Nice
6603,"Excellent course, but you have to use other materials from different courses as well."
6604,Very good course.
6605,I really enjoyed this course. I think the toughest for a newbie like me was the second course R programming. But the following courses including this one flow very well and are easy to follow with real life examples. It does get easier after the second course
6606,A little monotonous sometimes. Otherwise good.
6607,Excellent course.
6608,"This course is great, instructor is good, however, the material of this course is not well organized, even the swirl practice is not put in the correct week, not in the same pace as the lectures. The quiz and project are far much easier than lecture content."
6609,To fast pace and missing lot of content to make this lesson enjoyable!!!
6610,Muy intuitivo y con excelentes ejemplos!
6611,great courses!!! very practical but no a lot of mathemetics
6612,This is a great course. The content clearly explains the regression model.
6613, Very Nice! 
6614,"This was better than the statistical inference course, but Brian still puts too much emphasis on the precision of his language (as if he's teaching to other mathematicians) which makes it difficult to understand. I would like to see a bit more dumbed down explanation of the mathematics in the examples (similar to Sal at Khan Academy). If that happened, this would definitely be a 5 star course. "
6615,"Very interesting course, yet course content could be spread more evenly (week 4 is really a lot)"
6616,Was tough but thoroughly had fun completing it. Its a cleverly designed course.
6617,"This course is much improved, when compared with Statistical Inference. The instructor have put much effort in making the lectures interesting and casual, at the same time not loosing the value of contents. I especially liked some subtle jokes - just a finishing human touch.Some lectures from 4th week were not very well rehearser and shot hastily. Some quiz question were disproportionately difficult, but most of material is covered in course or course materials. Otherwise the course is very educational. "
6618,Hard but rewarding work that I think is perfect for Data Science.
6619,"I was hoping to learn about PROBIT models. I know they are very similar to LOGIT ones, but still... the pace is a little bit too fast and I think it requires more time than what it says."
6620,A well defined learning path to understand the fundation of machine learning techniques.
6621,"Great ressources. Usefull presentations, maybe too rich for a newbie.It was too fast for me. Could be done in 2x more time :/"
6622,good review of the fundamentals
6623,Learned a lot
6624,Great course.
6625,Excellent - thanks!
6626,Excellent course. Might be difficult to get full value of information without prior exposure/background.
6627,Very practical/hands-on intro to regression models. You will definitely be able to apply those methods after this course whenever you need them.
6628,"Regression models was almost just as difficult as statistical inference. Again, the swirls and exercises were of great help. The pace, as always, was quite fast, but in the end all the pieces fitted together. Congratulations on a job well done!"
6629,Like the way the Prof uses media. This is a very light touch on a very deep subject so it has to balance analytical work with the light trust me and just do it approach. The balance was mostly there although on a couple items I don't know that I had a good enough grip to know what I don't know.
6630,Good course! Prof Caffo is very clear in his explanations!
6631,Something was missing from this course. I cam away with an increased understanding of regression but I still feel like I struggle with many concepts and had to put in much more time than the recommended.Still when I found the answer it was all still contained and maybe the material itself is just advanced.my 2c
6632,"Requires much more than a month to digest the material and complete the assignments. A default/initial one-week offering is too tight unless you are only taking the course (not working). I know one can complete the course in more than a single round and I did that but I still don't think the expectations should be set for a single month.Instruction (video content) can be much better, at least compared to a lot of other courses on Coursera. "
6633,Nice Course
6634,Not worth it for the bucks. Instructor has tried his best to make no sense of the subject. I would be happy for a refund. 
6635,My name is Jose Antonio from Brazil. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications. The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructors
6636,Very good.
6637,Very good course
6638,Love the whole course approach on the importance of linear models and how one should interpret them to get a better grasp of the data one possesses - one should definitely take the statistical inference course before attempting this course beforehand.
6639,Very helpful!
6640,great introduction to regression models
6641,This course failed greatly to balance the workload by week. The third week which I think was the most important one have too many information to learn and assimilate whereas the first two weeks could be rearranged to start multivariate regression earlier. Another proof of week 3 issue: the related swirl exercises start in week2 (2 of them) and finish in week4 (2 more exercises) !!!!!I think one of the most important expertise and knowledge that a data scientist must know and master was unfairly squeezed in one week leaving no time for the learner/student to do more search/exercises on the subject. 
6642,"Great course. The content might be improved to be more clear. I feel that sometimes the instructor assumes we are familiar with some concepts we have not seen in previous courses. Also, some times he does a very good job explaining the WHY before the HOW, and some other times he does not. Very knowledgeable instructor."
6643,"I am no used to this educational system so I find difficult to follow without any proof or demonstration of the mathematical tools. I find proofs necessary for a good understanding of concepts. Another benefit of proof will be to have a more rigorous framework for variable names in the explanations. Even though this is more a practical course, it will benefit from being a bit more rigorous ; so at least people can make proofs on they own.Other than that, it is a great course. Very practical and to the point."
6644,nice and practical class! I think if provide some recommend reading may create more deeper insight in regression
6645,prerequisites are very mandatory to do this course
6646,"Great course to learn various regression models and R tools to implement them efficiently, butwas little hard to keep with the deadline. "
6647,"Sometimes videos were hard to understand, especially in week 3."
6648,"I enjoyed the earlier courses more. I did not like the way the materials were provided. There were a lot of very complex ideas were presented, in a very concise and brief manner. Also, there should be more exercises to practice. May be its me, but, I guess, I might need more time to fully comprehend the materials."
6649,"To me, this is by far the best course in the series. It deals with the scientific foundation of how to do data science: regression models, residuals, measures of the quality of the prediction, etc. The teacher is clearly a mathematician and has an academic style of presenting. He is very clear and chooses the subject in a clever way. One always understands what he or she is doing.Highly recommended. It doesn't get five stars only because it covers only the basics; I would have really liked it to last twice as much!"
6650,Very well thought-out!
6651,Everything you need to know to have a clear understanding of regression models and learn how to use their basic functions in R.
6652,Excellent overview of a very broad and complex topic with plenty of useful applications within R. The course project does an outstanding job at teaching the pitfalls of omitted variable bias.
6653,"I again found many of the lectures to be difficult to follow along, there seems to be lots of different styles of videos in the way that the person was superimposed on the slides. In fact it was often impossible to read the text in the slide due to the size of the presenters head which obscured the text. Honestly this data science course is getting worse as the months progress, you really should think of updating the content of the course if you want to continue to charge money for it. 2 stars as I did actually learn something despite the quality of the material and its delivery."
6654,It is a good course for learning regression model implementation in R. You may need to have a basic understanding of popular regression models like linear &amp; logistic as the course doesn't cover mathematical aspects in detail
6655,I really learned some useful knowledge and codes from this course!
6656,the lecture notes is a bit confusing
6657,"Extremely useful and exciting. Everything from previous modules fall in places and you may see some practical implementations from the course. By the way R is awesome!Many thanks to faculty, you do a great job. "
6658,Great - learned a bunch
6659,"I was really disappointed with this course. I took the other courses from Brian Caffo and truly enjoyed them. For the previous courses, I've always used the books and they helped me tremendously to be able to comprehend the material. There is a book for Regression Models but but it's a real mess. It feels like a draft that no one cared to take a second look. There is a bunch of wrong code and typos. The explanation doesn't go as far as it should. I had to resort to many different sources just to be able to get by the course. I hope the instructors review this course soon because it does not have the same quality as others. If they don't review it, don't bother paying for it. Try learning Regression Models elsewhere."
6660,"With all respect, Professor, if you are reading all our comments, I think you are a really smart person and you should take all the negative feedback from your students here, positively and constructively. As having good knowledge will never be equals to able to produce good students. Personally, I feel that you should lower down yourself and speak to the level of your students/audience. Use more simple examples, draw a big picture in our minds on what is this course all about, what are we going to achieve, in each of the topics, what are we going to look at and what methods available. For foundation class like this, I think few simple examples and introducing one or two useful methods in each topic would be more than sufficient to us. The objective should be providing us with the basic knowledge, get us interested in this subject, and able to apply those well taught basic knowledge. As when we are interested, for sure we will go and do more research, and some might even would like to move on to intermediate or advance levels.The key point here is speak to the level of your audience. Even if you are able to talk everything above the sky and up to the moon. If no one able to understand you, it is useless."
6661,"Given the importance of this subject, this course should have been split in two or more or have a longer duration to properly address subjects as GLM or model selection techniques."
6662,Good course. My only negative remark is that I really missed the swirl exercises that were available for the other courses of this specialization.
6663,The course is essentially just a review of formulas with very little intuition explained to the beginner. It was necessary to use a collection of outside material from other courses and readings to learn the concepts. This course needs to be completely redone with a focus on developing a student's intuition for the material and then support this intuition with basic examples that build as the course progresses. A fundamental demonstration of how to use R to work through regression models (starting from square one) should be added so that this becomes a self-contained course. As it currently stands it is a collection of poorly integrated slides and concepts that serve to confuse the student more than educate. Other classes teach this material infinitely better.
6664,"The level of this course is a lot higher than the other courses. The course contains a lot of material and exercises which makes it hard to finish the course within the time period of one month. Nevertheless did I like Brian's way of teaching. He's a perfectionist and takes his time to explain everything in detail. I really liked the challenge, 5 stars."
6665,Outstanding material with different levels of difficulty and depth on the subject. Great source material.
6666,very concise and well taught
6667,"Difficult, fast peaced and not well explained. Requires a lot of work. "
6668,"It's a great course and tought very well. It required effort, you apply many of previously teach concept and requires a lot of excercise"
6669,Interesting and important course!I don't think this course is suitable for beginners. You need to know this stuff before you take the course. Works well as a refresher.
6670,Very informative and detailed explanation of how regression model works!
6671,The video lectures are really boring and useless
6672,Great course!
6673,very usful
6674,"Very concise and good structured course. The new videos are much better than the old ones! Thank you Brian Caffo! However in the discussion forum you find less posts than in the previous format, which is a pitty. "
6675,Fantastic course with great visualizations
6676,I had a lot of fun in this course. The exercises in the text and quizzes help me understand the concepts
6677, To be honest I don't think this is worth the money. 
6678,Advance topic in regression model.
6679,recommend to others too
6680,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material. 
6681,"This course gives a very thorough and rigorous treatment to the topic of regression models.It teaches you how to derive from the ground, how regression models are made and how to interpret every information available through regression models.Although the lectures are very lengthy and dry, the course offers a very rich well of information that is not readily available else where. Thanks to Brian Caffo for the wealth of information about regression models taught through this course!"
6682,I learnt regression models from this course.
6683,Great course.
6684,Quite useful!
6685,"Content and quizz are not aligned. Mentors answer to 0% of the forum posts.Poor student community.Do not pay for this course, just follow the swirl and/or get some tuto about regressions."
6686,Should cover a lot of dfificuties when the model assumptions are violated and should be for a longer time or having a second course about this theme.
6687,"The professor doesn't explain clearly as part of the videos is his correcting himself or saying the same thing two or three times. And why must the videos show the teacher? It distracts from the slides and seeing him move doesn't help understand anything betterConcepts like VIF or hat values are not very well explained by the teacher, at least the SWIRL lesson explains it correctly. ANOVA and ANCOVA are mentioned in the description but they aren't explained anywhere. ANOVA is used without any explanation of what it is.I found myself searching online for other sources to understand the concepts."
6688,Great!
6689,"This course will give you a good basic foundation in regression models. However, do be prepared to do a good amount of work besides just viewing the videos. I would recommend at the very least to go through the exercises in the 'recommended textbook' to gain a better understanding."
6690,great
6691,"The course is good. Unlike the previous courses I took in this track, there was almost no interaction in the forums and also no-one to give feedback. I wonder if there were any TA's present in this run."
6692,"Some topics that are important, are obviated"
6693,Had fun
6694,Very relevant!
6695,"I like this course a lot because it solidified my understanding of regression. I have often read about regression when reading scientific articles however, i never took the time to really investigate the mechanics on how it is done. Thanks to this course i can now appreciate better the journals that i read. Furthermore, the course project for this course was quite interesting, not too hard, and was bit challenging. There was plenty of time to finish the project and some extra time to make it even better than a simple submission that meets the basic requirements of the course. Thanks to the my classmates and the nice people in Coursera and R, i had a great time learning during this course. "
6696,"This course is better than Statistical Inference, and I think it is as useful. Non credit excersise are still very good at helping with understanding in practice what is going on. "
6697,Very intuitive course
6698,Coursera keeps changing my rating. Not cool. 
6699,"Videos were very difficult to follow along with. Overall, I learned a good amount though."
6700,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.
6701,"concise, practical and straight forward"
6702,"I found the videos tough to watch. I was hoping for something that would be more practical for non-statisticians, but the lectures mainly devolved into mathematical proofs. That said, I did learn some from this class. Just not as much as I'd hoped."
6703,"This is a decent class, covering linear regression and a few of its variants in good detail. It's a challenging subject, but presented acceptably here."
6704,The instructor is at time incomprehensible. It would be helpful to speak more slowly and pause more often. Otherwise he sounds like repeating something that he's so well memorized after many years of teaching.
6705,easy to understand and full of new idea about using R.especially 'manipulate' package is very useful
6706,"This course is the first one in the Data Science series to lapse in terms of the clarity of the lectures, and the sense of cohesiveness of the material. Brian Caffo's lectures in Statistical Inference were good; in this course they seem to veer left and right rather than get straight to the essence of whatever subject he is lecturing about. A more structured final project would have been helpful. The instructions on this project weren't quite so blunt as to say Take this data set, do some regression-y stuff and come back with something about these two variables, but that's basically as far as our instructions went. It could have been a great learning experience to have a more detailed guide through the construction of a regression analysis, but instead an assignment which was 40% of our grade was put together as an afterthought. It was the assignment equivalent of stopping in the 7-11 a block away from a birthday party to buy a card.Also, in terms of delivering the content: Mr. Caffo needs to structure his slide/video arrangements so that he is not standing in front of the text. Think of it from the point of view of somebody wanting to listen and read at the same time."
6707,The instructor is not good and doesn't explain things clearly. 
6708,"The material presented was of course useful, but I never really felt like I understood how it all tied together, or what the big picture was. I think that some case studies that show how all of the concepts relate to one another, or how they are used in the bigger picture would be helpful. Also, as a suggestion, I feel that if something is important enough to be included in the quiz, it merits more than the briefest of mentions in the lecture."
6709,Nice.
6710,I loved studying Regression Models taught by Prof. Brian Caffo. I think these are very important techniques that I will be able to use for my research and analysis.I found the teaching to be very in depth in explaining various aspects of regression model development.
6711,"Not the easiest course, but very rewarding if you hang in there. The material is very well explained with ample examples."
6712,A very well organized course with nice simple explanations and introductions into the world of regression models
6713,Very difficult. Needs homework problems guided by videos like Statistical Inference coarse to make easier.
6714,I think this course needs more emphasis on practical applications and less mathematical background.
6715,"Overall okay course but the lectures are too focused on theory with some applications to the real world. I think this course needs to be reconfigured and taught from an applied focus instead of 30% applied 70% theory. Also the new format is horrible and TAs are nonexistent as are discussions in general on the forums now. The TAs were a critical learning component before especially considering that unlike on EdX where course staff actually participates in the forums, on Coursera I do not think I have ever observed course staff actively participating in the forums. "
6716,Good course. Prof. Caffo is a great teacher! Hope to see an advanced version of RegMods soon! 
6717,"The course content was very brief and well structured, Regression being a rather vast topic demands a lot more time. 4 weeks seemed a bit less! Overall satisfied by what the course offered."
6718,"Good introduction to the usefulness and traps of linear models. By the way, having the teacher filmed for the lectures does provide a more engaging experience."
6719,Very comprehensive course for developing the basics of regression models
6720,"This class, along with Statistical Inference and Machine Language , are the meat and potato's for data science. I had taken most, if not all of these classes as an undergrad many years ago . The tools for stats have changed significantly and these classes being taught with the open source R language, really put you at the forefront of this new field. "
6721,Excellent course with great didactic. Congratulations!
6722,Great introduction and plenty of resources for more in depth study. 
6723,"Poorly designed, executed and instructed. Too much is left off the materials. "
6724,"The flows of courses instructed by Caffo(Statistical Inference and Regression Models) are too long to concentrate it and the quiz is ???not quite related in lecture.However, Contents of the book is really good, as well as homework in the book. "
6725,way to much emphasis on non-data science. This one course covers more information that the rest of the courses combined.. 
6726,It is a great introductory course into Regression analysis. I highly recommend it!
6727,This was a tough class covering a lot of material. The last week on logistic regression completely lost me. If you're new to stats like me you might want to take it more than once.
6728,"First 3 weeks give very reasonable overview of the subject - topics of linear / polynomial / multivariate regression are covered quite well. Week 4 is a bit sloppy and ad-hoc, comparing to first 3 weeks - GLMs are given poorly."
6729,"Data, our ???raw??? material, becomes plentiful. Let???s learn form it.Thanks to constant progress in information technologies, this increasing production of data is an outstanding opportunity to improve our knowledge of subject matters we care about, e.g. environment, health, markets???Properly analyzing these data in the scope of addressing specific questions is not trivial. But it can be learn. And if there were one place where one could acquire these skills and become anxious to grow in that field, this would be the Coursera Regression Models course. Data analysts, like any professionals, need her/his set of tools. Good tools make good patricians. The Coursera Data Science Specialization that includes this Regression Models class is where one can learn how to use the right tools and reduce them into practice. Passionate instructors who obviously take great care in communicating effectively the knowledge they master teach these courses admirably. Highly recommended course and specialization,There are so many unanswered questions, so many new relationships to uncover. Learn how. "
6730,I just realized that you have to upgrade(pay $49) in order to submit the quiz and receive the feedback. That's depressing since my purpose is to watch the video and check out what I learned so far without getting any certificate. The policy here bring huge inconvenience for people like me. 
6731,I expected more in Binomial Regression and Poisson regression
6732,Great Course
6733,A decent overview of regression
6734,Appears more like a revision for those who already know the content than geared towards those new to the subject.
6735,There's just something about the course content that is difficult to attain. It's presented at way too high of a level without enough tangible examples of getting down into the weeds of how to actually perform and interpret the models and functions.
6736,"good quick overview, could have more actual R examples in lectures"
6737,"Loved the course and the content. Only critique is that I would have liked to have a lecture about transformations, and interpretation of transformed data coefficients."
6738,"As for the Statistical Inference course, this course is amazing but is presented in a more complex way than it should be. Once again the concepts are simple and the math not so hard, yet I had to do a lot of research outside the course to be able to understand these simple concepts and derive the not so hard mathematics.Brian Caffo is clearly brilliant and, I would say, seem to be a good lad too, but something is missing. Too often the details are thrown at us without being properly framed in the context or without having the proper concept being introduced progressively.I have a theory about teaching since I was 15, and so far it has proven to be true. Imagine that learning is about climbing a mountain in which tall steps have been carved. Each step is taller than the student. The teacher is somewhere higher than the students (not necessarily at the top, if there is such a thing).The job of the teacher is to throw boxes (concepts) and balls (details) of different size, shape and colors. The job of the student is to catch these boxes and balls and to put the right balls in the right boxes in order to make a staircase out of it to climb (at least) one of the giant stair up.A good teacher makes sure to throw the concepts first than the details and to clearly specify which balls go into which box, as well as which boxes go inside/over which other boxes.But most teacher simply throw the balls and boxes in an not so well structured manner, so the poor students try to catch as many as he can, but also miss a lot of them. His hands can hold a limited amount of balls. If he doesn't have the right box to put them, he would either miss the next balls, or put the one he hold in his hand in the wrong box.Bottom line, the best teachers are those who focus on the concepts (and context) and make sure that the concepts are well understood before introducing details to stuck in these concepts. From my experience our brain (or at least mine) better learn this way. It is as if our brain need first to establish a category-pattern (the concept/context) to which it will associate detail-patterns. But without a proper category-pattern, our brain is having a hard time to properly remember the detail-patterns or miss-associate them to the wrong category-pattern (which create even more confusion).Hope it was helpful somehow... "
6739,Course teaches basics of regression in R
6740," This course goes on a very fast pace and simply does not have the charm of all the other courses in the specialization. I understand that a lot of content is covered within a month, but there should be supplementary course material available. Moreover, TAs should be more active on the forums. I have seen most of the questions just being discussed among the students. A little disappointed. Will probably have to watch all the material again to have confidence with it. "
6741,Great course with a thorough introduction to regression and linear model. 
6742,"One of the most valuable course in series. Also one of the hardest, expecially if you are newbie to regression models."
6743,"Better than Stat Inference, and gave some reasonable intuition, but could be improved I think by focussing on more understanding and less maths and formulas. Some of it did seem to be - here' s a formula, plug the numbers in to get the quiz question right, whereas in reality (in the world of work) that question is completely unrealistic - you have raw data and you need to do the regression and understand what it means."
6744,Excellent introductory course!
6745,"Un curso dif??cil de entender si no tienes la base matem??tica de regresi??n. Uno no sabe por d??nde empezar, cualquiera de los cursos de esta serie (Statistical Inference, R programming...) pareciera que te saturan de informaci??n. Es bueno para curiosos con bases en R y que quieren saber m??s de Regresi??n"
6746,This course is packed with great lessons and Prof. Caffo puts it all together very cogently. 
6747,I find it very tough to understand everything. Buying the course book helps to overcome this. You have to dedicate a lot of time.
6748,"This is the best course of the bunch so far. These courses are really promising -- I've learned a lot from them and they probably have everything they could have at the price - but I'm leaving just one star off because I feel very strongly that some effort could really go a long way to making a better language map of these courses. A person leaves this course, and even more so the inference course, not being very clear one where their new capabilities lie in the spectrum, and without the strongest sense of how to experiment with linear models. One case in point of the the huge strengths and a slight weakness of this course -- Professor Caffo mentions the wonderfully tantalizing fact that the application of linear models can get you most of the way to the top of a Kaggle competition. That feels true, I trust him, and it's really cool. But it would be SO. MUCH. COOLER. with an article showing a linear model attacking that kind of problem. "
6749,"A few glitches, but excellent like all the other "
6750,Great
6751,Wonderful course 
6752,Really good introduction to regression models. 
6753,Great course!
6754,"One of the better classes of the specialization. I found the quizzes quizzes (in particular week 3 and 4) quite challenging. I took the ML class before, which I do not recommend. Take this class before the ML class."
6755,"Awesome course. Handling a complex topic in a very lucid manner. However, be prepared of finishing in more than 1 class because it will really take time to grasp the concepts especially if you are not from statistical background. Great job Brian."
6756,Exceptional Learning!
6757,good intro
6758,well done!
6759,Really helpful and well presented.
6760,"Not impressed. Dr. Caffo tried to use non-calculus, non-linear-algrebra ways to explain complex concepts and derivations. IMO, he should not have done that. It only made things more confusing. Also the final project is so unsatisfactory in that we were to analyze the data with 32 obs but 11 variables! How robust could it be? Was expecting something much more challenging than that."
6761,Complicated but good information!
6762,Nicely presented and understandable course with a challenging an interesting project. 
6763,Good
6764,I think this is the best course I have ever came across in the coursera. Everything is discussed in the most simple manner with great depth.
6765,Some lab work (swirl()) did not match the material presentation order. Essential coursework delivered at a blistering pace. Good Stuff. 
6766,Very Good Course !
6767,"Great course, although feeling as always a bit rushed on the last lectures. At least it makes you want to investigate more about the subject.I find frustrating however not to have a proper instructor example of the final assignment, it is hard to review other participants work and realize what they / you have done wrong without actually knowing how best the assignment should have been fulfilled.And as all courses in this specialization, there is not much interaction between participants, and not much effort by mentors to animate it"
6768,2 thumbs up
6769,"Good course on the theories behind regression, followed by significant applications and how to use them in R. Lectures are very dry, but the information within them is very useful."
6770,Great introduction to regression models. Pretty clear
6771,"The concepts are well explained and precise. I think it depends on the individual to dive deeper into the topic by independent learning. Good data examples. Also following the suggested book of the author helps with some extra excercises. However , I feel extra practice questions would help ."
6772,"Good foundation in the Data Science Certification for Practical Machine Learning. There are 3 areas that I would like to dig deeper so far: Statistical Inference, Regression Models and Practical Machine Learning (perhaps + Deep Learning)."
6773,Lots of material needs additional study (from different sources) as it's only summarily explained. Much math without the link to the praxis :-(
6774,Very Challenging CourseVery well presented Great material/source of information for study Loved It !
6775,"In-depth and detailed, this one month course will provide aspirants with the knowledge and skills required to conduct efficient regressions."
6776,"Once again an excellent course, thank you!"
6777,"A very intense course, where a lot of concepts are introduced. In order for all the new information to be metabolized, it took me much more than four weeks."
6778,"This course has been the most difficult in the Dara Science track so far, but you get a more in depth knowledge in data analysis and interpretation based on statistical models."
6779,"This course was an improvement in teaching modality from the statistical inference course, with more polished content, but the link between the lectures and the actual exercises was still a bit strained. Overall, it felt like there was a bit of a disconnect between the swirl exercises and the lectures, and this led to a lot of self-teaching."
6780,Many things are not clear enough in multivariable regression part.
6781,"Amazing course, I learnt a lot."
6782,Very good material but often too fragmentend/messy. The notes would need re-writing.
6783,"This course is great, if you want to get into it. This was the first time I have been exposed to linear and generalized linear regression. I was overwhelmed by so much information and knowledge that I needed extra time to understand and to bring the pieces from week 1 to week 4 together. The peer reviews weren't (in my case) not very helpful. I missed concrete feedback on my approach and the result. I would have appreciated some kind of assurance that the achieved results are of quality and on the level of data scientist. "
6784,"Important material, poorly taught."
6785,Great Course
6786,Content regarding variable selection is kind of rough.
6787,"Excellent course, but you have to use other materials from different courses as well."
6788,I really enjoyed this course. I think the toughest for a newbie like me was the second course R programming. But the following courses including this one flow very well and are easy to follow with real life examples. It does get easier after the second course
6789,A little monotonous sometimes. Otherwise good.
6790,Excellent course.
6791,To fast pace and missing lot of content to make this lesson enjoyable!!!
6792,Muy intuitivo y con excelentes ejemplos!
6793,great courses!!! very practical but no a lot of mathemetics
6794,This is a great course. The content clearly explains the regression model.
6795, Very Nice! 
6796,"Very interesting course, yet course content could be spread more evenly (week 4 is really a lot)"
6797,Was tough but thoroughly had fun completing it. Its a cleverly designed course.
6798,"This course is much improved, when compared with Statistical Inference. The instructor have put much effort in making the lectures interesting and casual, at the same time not loosing the value of contents. I especially liked some subtle jokes - just a finishing human touch.Some lectures from 4th week were not very well rehearser and shot hastily. Some quiz question were disproportionately difficult, but most of material is covered in course or course materials. Otherwise the course is very educational. "
6799,Hard but rewarding work that I think is perfect for Data Science.
6800,"I was hoping to learn about PROBIT models. I know they are very similar to LOGIT ones, but still... the pace is a little bit too fast and I think it requires more time than what it says."
6801,"Great ressources. Usefull presentations, maybe too rich for a newbie.It was too fast for me. Could be done in 2x more time :/"
6802,good review of the fundamentals
6803,Learned a lot
6804,Great course.
6805,Excellent - thanks!
6806,Excellent course. Might be difficult to get full value of information without prior exposure/background.
6807,Very practical/hands-on intro to regression models. You will definitely be able to apply those methods after this course whenever you need them.
6808,"Regression models was almost just as difficult as statistical inference. Again, the swirls and exercises were of great help. The pace, as always, was quite fast, but in the end all the pieces fitted together. Congratulations on a job well done!"
6809,Like the way the Prof uses media. This is a very light touch on a very deep subject so it has to balance analytical work with the light trust me and just do it approach. The balance was mostly there although on a couple items I don't know that I had a good enough grip to know what I don't know.
6810,Something was missing from this course. I cam away with an increased understanding of regression but I still feel like I struggle with many concepts and had to put in much more time than the recommended.Still when I found the answer it was all still contained and maybe the material itself is just advanced.my 2c
6811,"Requires much more than a month to digest the material and complete the assignments. A default/initial one-week offering is too tight unless you are only taking the course (not working). I know one can complete the course in more than a single round and I did that but I still don't think the expectations should be set for a single month.Instruction (video content) can be much better, at least compared to a lot of other courses on Coursera. "
6812,Nice Course
6813,My name is Jose Antonio from Brazil. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications. The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructors
6814,Very good.
6815,Very good course
6816,Love the whole course approach on the importance of linear models and how one should interpret them to get a better grasp of the data one possesses - one should definitely take the statistical inference course before attempting this course beforehand.
6817,great introduction to regression models
6818,This course failed greatly to balance the workload by week. The third week which I think was the most important one have too many information to learn and assimilate whereas the first two weeks could be rearranged to start multivariate regression earlier. Another proof of week 3 issue: the related swirl exercises start in week2 (2 of them) and finish in week4 (2 more exercises) !!!!!I think one of the most important expertise and knowledge that a data scientist must know and master was unfairly squeezed in one week leaving no time for the learner/student to do more search/exercises on the subject. 
6819,"Great course. The content might be improved to be more clear. I feel that sometimes the instructor assumes we are familiar with some concepts we have not seen in previous courses. Also, some times he does a very good job explaining the WHY before the HOW, and some other times he does not. Very knowledgeable instructor."
6820,"I am no used to this educational system so I find difficult to follow without any proof or demonstration of the mathematical tools. I find proofs necessary for a good understanding of concepts. Another benefit of proof will be to have a more rigorous framework for variable names in the explanations. Even though this is more a practical course, it will benefit from being a bit more rigorous ; so at least people can make proofs on they own.Other than that, it is a great course. Very practical and to the point."
6821,nice and practical class! I think if provide some recommend reading may create more deeper insight in regression
6822,"Sometimes videos were hard to understand, especially in week 3."
6823,"I enjoyed the earlier courses more. I did not like the way the materials were provided. There were a lot of very complex ideas were presented, in a very concise and brief manner. Also, there should be more exercises to practice. May be its me, but, I guess, I might need more time to fully comprehend the materials."
6824,"To me, this is by far the best course in the series. It deals with the scientific foundation of how to do data science: regression models, residuals, measures of the quality of the prediction, etc. The teacher is clearly a mathematician and has an academic style of presenting. He is very clear and chooses the subject in a clever way. One always understands what he or she is doing.Highly recommended. It doesn't get five stars only because it covers only the basics; I would have really liked it to last twice as much!"
6825,Very well thought-out!
6826,Everything you need to know to have a clear understanding of regression models and learn how to use their basic functions in R.
6827,Excellent overview of a very broad and complex topic with plenty of useful applications within R. The course project does an outstanding job at teaching the pitfalls of omitted variable bias.
6828,"I again found many of the lectures to be difficult to follow along, there seems to be lots of different styles of videos in the way that the person was superimposed on the slides. In fact it was often impossible to read the text in the slide due to the size of the presenters head which obscured the text. Honestly this data science course is getting worse as the months progress, you really should think of updating the content of the course if you want to continue to charge money for it. 2 stars as I did actually learn something despite the quality of the material and its delivery."
6829,It is a good course for learning regression model implementation in R. You may need to have a basic understanding of popular regression models like linear &amp; logistic as the course doesn't cover mathematical aspects in detail
6830,I really learned some useful knowledge and codes from this course!
6831,Great - learned a bunch
6832,"I was really disappointed with this course. I took the other courses from Brian Caffo and truly enjoyed them. For the previous courses, I've always used the books and they helped me tremendously to be able to comprehend the material. There is a book for Regression Models but but it's a real mess. It feels like a draft that no one cared to take a second look. There is a bunch of wrong code and typos. The explanation doesn't go as far as it should. I had to resort to many different sources just to be able to get by the course. I hope the instructors review this course soon because it does not have the same quality as others. If they don't review it, don't bother paying for it. Try learning Regression Models elsewhere."
6833,Good course. My only negative remark is that I really missed the swirl exercises that were available for the other courses of this specialization.
6834,"The level of this course is a lot higher than the other courses. The course contains a lot of material and exercises which makes it hard to finish the course within the time period of one month. Nevertheless did I like Brian's way of teaching. He's a perfectionist and takes his time to explain everything in detail. I really liked the challenge, 5 stars."
6835,"Difficult, fast peaced and not well explained. Requires a lot of work. "
6836,Interesting and important course!I don't think this course is suitable for beginners. You need to know this stuff before you take the course. Works well as a refresher.
6837,Very informative and detailed explanation of how regression model works!
6838,Great course!
6839,"Very concise and good structured course. The new videos are much better than the old ones! Thank you Brian Caffo! However in the discussion forum you find less posts than in the previous format, which is a pitty. "
6840,Fantastic course with great visualizations
6841, To be honest I don't think this is worth the money. 
6842,Advance topic in regression model.
6843,recommend to others too
6844,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material. 
6845,Quite useful!
6846,Should cover a lot of dfificuties when the model assumptions are violated and should be for a longer time or having a second course about this theme.
6847,"This course will give you a good basic foundation in regression models. However, do be prepared to do a good amount of work besides just viewing the videos. I would recommend at the very least to go through the exercises in the 'recommended textbook' to gain a better understanding."
6848,"Some topics that are important, are obviated"
6849,Had fun
6850,"I like this course a lot because it solidified my understanding of regression. I have often read about regression when reading scientific articles however, i never took the time to really investigate the mechanics on how it is done. Thanks to this course i can now appreciate better the journals that i read. Furthermore, the course project for this course was quite interesting, not too hard, and was bit challenging. There was plenty of time to finish the project and some extra time to make it even better than a simple submission that meets the basic requirements of the course. Thanks to the my classmates and the nice people in Coursera and R, i had a great time learning during this course. "
6851,Coursera keeps changing my rating. Not cool. 
6852,"Videos were very difficult to follow along with. Overall, I learned a good amount though."
6853,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.
6854,"I found the videos tough to watch. I was hoping for something that would be more practical for non-statisticians, but the lectures mainly devolved into mathematical proofs. That said, I did learn some from this class. Just not as much as I'd hoped."
6855,"This is a decent class, covering linear regression and a few of its variants in good detail. It's a challenging subject, but presented acceptably here."
6856,"The material presented was of course useful, but I never really felt like I understood how it all tied together, or what the big picture was. I think that some case studies that show how all of the concepts relate to one another, or how they are used in the bigger picture would be helpful. Also, as a suggestion, I feel that if something is important enough to be included in the quiz, it merits more than the briefest of mentions in the lecture."
6857,Nice.
6858,I loved studying Regression Models taught by Prof. Brian Caffo. I think these are very important techniques that I will be able to use for my research and analysis.I found the teaching to be very in depth in explaining various aspects of regression model development.
6859,"Not the easiest course, but very rewarding if you hang in there. The material is very well explained with ample examples."
6860,I think this course needs more emphasis on practical applications and less mathematical background.
6861,"This class, along with Statistical Inference and Machine Language , are the meat and potato's for data science. I had taken most, if not all of these classes as an undergrad many years ago . The tools for stats have changed significantly and these classes being taught with the open source R language, really put you at the forefront of this new field. "

6868,There's just something about the course content that is difficult to attain. It's presented at way too high of a level without enough tangible examples of getting down into the weeds of how to actually perform and interpret the models and functions.
6869,Excellent course material
6870,Gave me a footing on Server-side Development. I recommend it!
6871,Excellent introduction to Server-side development. I have used PHP for some similar but Node really rules!!
6872,Very bad video quality. The teacher is obviously bored by this course and does not put much effort in the creation process. 
6873,very good
6874,"It was great experience. Thank you, professor)"
6875,Awesome course. Everything explained in details and with great quality.
6876,This the best course available on Node.js
6877,Excellent introduction to NodeJS. The professor is too good :)
6878,good enough
6879,"Really great course! I feel like I learned a lot, and was even forced to dig a little deeper on my own than other courses. "
6880,"Wow! So much is covered in this part of the course. I know we only scratched the surface but everything from the quick setup of an API server using tools like Loopback to doing simple password auth and advanced Facebook authentication, and all of it connected to a MongoDB backend. Very useful!"
6881,A good Introduction to Server Side Programming in MEAN Stack
6882, I really enjoyed this training and I intend to deepen my knowledge in NodeJS. Thank You 
6883,Good course
6884,It is very good course. Teachs basics of NodeJs and backend and also gives some tricks. I recommend this course whoever want to learn NodeJs.
6885,thanks
6886,One of the best courses I ever took. The course material is amazing with proper instructions. More focus is put on building basics which is the need in the present world.
6887,"Very challenging, the lecture are really deep and could be improve ..overall really helpful!"
6888,The course is excellent. The professor is very clear and presents many concepts and resources usefuls.
6889,Its good to get started with server side development with node.
6890,Excelent course! 
6891,Excellent course to learn a lot about back end server development. The coverage is not only for database and APIs but touches upon user authentication etc. as well. I have a good grounding on server side development now. Thanks.
6892,Wonderful course to learn Server-side coding. Again Thanks a lot to Jogesh K Muppala for explaining each every topic very clear.
6893,Great course by great person!
6894,Excellent course!
6895,Very good but basic course.
6896,Excellent course and teaching lessons the examples are according the videos and the teacher has a lot of patience explaining everything with details.
6897,i do not understand why do i need in the videos see the face of the lecturer? i rather see the whole screen of code / slides why do i need to see him talk? in every site of videos like pluralsight etc u do not see the lecturer. concerning this course.. i was a bit disappointed i thought it would give me more profound knowledge on node. but it was cool. 
6898,Great course. Smart and fun !
6899,Excellent course material narrated in detail.
6900,"Nothing but following the lectures, hardly any quizes or assignments where you have to work things out on your own. Also, there's way too much material crammed into four weeks, leading to a lack of depth. I learned a lot, but this was not very engaging."
6901,I like the humor of the professor although I can not understand what that means.
6902,Good tutorials .. That's not because it is FREE .. 
6903,"Awesome Course, Learnt many things."
6904,awesome course!!!!
6905,"Excelent course,!!"
6906,This is very well designed course.
6907,one the best backend development courses on the web . covers a lot of topics . and yet gives you enough depth to be able to discover the rest on your own. the only problem with it is that it stall on the some basic stuff and then accelerates (a little) when it comes to the more advanced techniques.
6908,Very good course. Features well explained.
6909,"Best course for Node.js, express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose and putting them all together in perspective!"
6910,Very applicable and lot of insight into new NodeJS Territory 
6911,Realy great!
6912,"A well structured course that gives a good introduction to NodeJS. The final assignment does have a bit of a ramp in difficulty. However, I prefer it if a course has some challenges in it because I feel it is when you learn the most."
6913,"clearly structured, easy to understand; different technology stacks, quite complete; to my knowledge, the only course of this kind available. "
6914,"Superb Course, Thank You!"
6915,Great course!! i learn a lotvery professional and simple teaching.
6916,"Last assignment is a big jump, but i like it so very much "
6917,Awesome course! and strongloop is fantastic!
6918,This course is awesome
6919,Excellent! First time in the server-side; it was a very good course.
6920,Slow and redundant. Would have preferred a faster-paced and more substantive course.
6921,Very nice!
6922,This course is the best starting material for learning server programming
6923,good
6924,Really an awesome course.
6925,Great course! I learned so much and the difficulty is really well graded.
6926,Nice course for Full stack.
6927,Very helpful. With this we do not need to reinvent the wheel. Can REST easy (pun intended) on server side and focus more on the application.
6928,Great course! I'm glad I did it. 
6929,"The course is suitable for any programmers even you only have very basic knowledge on Javascript and no experience on Web development, professor is teaching the Node.js in a very clear structure so it is easy for any learners to understand.I would give 5 stars but the contents of this courses are too basic, I am hoping we can dig into a little bit the details instead of just installing and using the existing components."
6930,"Great introductory course, however, there are some anti-patterns taught (e.g. mongodb unbounded arrays). Also, there is no testing frameworks used - and this is a big missing element for modern careers in web development."
6931,Great course. Very informative. Fully integrated API's as a result of completing this course. 
6932,Very good!
6933,"I love this course. Muppala sir, taught so well they explain each and every topics so well."
6934,awesome
6935,"Concise and to the point in every corner, lean like a good verse, the path is clear as you go. A sum of seemingly simple parts constitute a valuable body of knowledge, covering hours of alternative late night stackoverflow sitting. Thank you, Prof. Muppala!"
6936,really amazing 
6937,It's exellent course I have ever studied. I would like to thank Professor Muppala very much.
6938,"There's a lack of crucial information such as how to merge AngularJs with all the Back-End. A few chapters such as cookies and session could had been skipped, even the prof. Muppala doesn't advice to use them, but as they're easy to teach so they're explained intead of more imporant things.I'm getting crazy to do the most simple thing: a MEAN Stack Login. So why is not explained the most usual thing here? There are no excuses. Login and uploading files IS IMPORTANT to be learned."
6939,The course is a very good start to learn NodeJS. Strong recommend for anyone who wants to start NodeJS.
6940,"It provides good resources and code, but if you get stuck, there's no help. By the time one gets this far the participation has plummeted and there's no mentors or instructor help. Very frustrating to get this far only to be stopped because you're on your very own."
6941,good coursenode.js
6942,Enthusiastic instructor
6943,good
6944,"Very good explanations about each topic, some times instructor is explaining basics to get more knowledge on topic. Excellent. Thanks for opportunity."
6945,Quite easy to understand!
6946,Very good curriculum! Everything explained in the correct way. Each unit has its concrete topic. All needed to start work in this field. Thank you so much.
6947,learned a lot. I
6948,Mr. Muppala has a natural talent for teaching. 
6949,Amazing course! Mr. Muppala is a rockstar! 
6950,"This is the best, most comprehensive NodeJS course on the internet, PERIOD! "
6951,The direction of the content is correct. First node and then his wrapper Express. 
6952,This course covered most of topics and very well explained. Unit testing for nodejs could also have been part of it. Oauth2 and JSON webtokens and Mongoose concepts are very well explained.
6953,very good course
6954,Enough material to make this a two course. Feels more crammed than other courses but invaluable coverage.
6955,EXCELLENT! Worth taking. Professor is awesome!
6956,Very interesting course and learnt many new things. Excellent teaching and assignments. Highly recommend to others who want to learn nodejs and mongodb! 
6957,Great content and teaching! Thanks Professor Muppala!
6958,Awesome Course. easy to understand.
6959,Extremely boring and very confusing
6960,amazing course!
6961,It's a good course but it lacks web socket and socket io . Please add a few lessons for them
6962,Excellent course
6963,"I have learn a lot, big thanks to the PHd!"
6964,Excelent course! Many different aspects are studied. 
6965,I'm enjoying this practical course
6966,Good enough to be an intro.
6967,great course for node beginner. Let's continue to create some great course
6968,Awesome Course !!!!
6969,"Great introductory class on Node.js! I took this without the other courses in the specialization, and found it to meet my needs perfectly."
6970,"Best course ever, congratulations... "
6971,Great course!
6972,good
6973,Lots of useful information!
6974,nice!
6975,Excellent course covering a wide range of topics and tools.
6976,"The course is challenging, but the professor is really awesome. "
6977,Super basic! The instructor goes super slowly and spends a lot of time on unnecessary stuff. Each video can be down in half the time
6978,"This was a good introduction to the topic, although a little slowly paced for my tastes, but I am a long time professional programmer, so I have much more background to draw on than many of the students. I started with this course, which encouraged me to go back and take more from the sequence. I recommend taking them in order."
6979,"Fantastic Course, Learn a lot! "
6980,Just Awesome
6981,"Though I did not finish the entire course, I have learned a lot on all the topics I am interested. Highly recommended. "
6982,"One of the best courses, very useful material and the teacher was great !!!"
6983,"This course has covered most thing I need to know about about developing a website using MEAN. The lecture notes is easy to understand. After learnt this course, I have learn web development my self cause this course has provide real experience on not only learn with professor but also doing self learning."
6984,Great course to learn the basics of server-side development with nodejs 
6985,Great teacher! 
6986,superb
6987,Very interesting explanation \ 
6988,Loved it.
6989,"Seems like the quality of this specialization goes down with every course. The instructor is not showing us the way we should think about developing programs in NodeJS, but he insists on using PowerPoint slides to show us how to code! It's 2016, and there are way better mediums for communicating with your students. Simply copying and pasting code and explaining what every line does is not the right way of teaching any concept, especially when you are dealing with a new technology. For the start, the instructor can actually type the code and explain what goes through his mind during each step. That way anyone can follow his problem solving methods and benefit from the course. I had to take other online courses on Code School and Pluralsight just to understand what's going on, and later come back to finish the homework. "
6990,the instructor is awesome .
6991, Bonne Formation j'ai aime 
6992,Great course for anyone interested in web development
6993,Excellent Course!
6994,"Great contents as the rest of the courses in the specialization. I'm afraid I need to be a little bit critical with this one though:1) The contents are really jammed into 4 weeks - The last week's contents are actually some kind of miscellany between mongoose, https, authentication and BaaS2) Not a single quiz or self-evaluation of sorts along the course - To be completely fair, the exercises shown along the way might make up for it. Still, I think it's important to spread some quizes around so as to make absorb the concepts more effectively3) The quality of the presentations is somewhat lower than other courses. There's even a video towards the end of the course where a Linkedin notification springs up on top, which even makes the presenter pause for a few seconds.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this course and definitely appreciate the effort put into it - Given the newly introduced Coursera fees, I'd expect much more quality in place to make it 70 buck-worth, though"
6995,I learned a lot new things 
6996,happy for learning this course 
6997,"I love the subject.To be honest for the first glance I didn't bet all my coins in this course, but I really got fascinated, the teacher indeed explains all the steps required and forth in order to grasp the idea around what is gonna be explained."
6998,Excellent
6999,Amazing professor. Many thanks for taking the pains to explain the concepts so lucidly
7000,"very clear, recommend!!"
7001, Excellent course really thank you for sharing this knowledge and learning 
7002,Great!
7003,"I have looked at several courses on NodeJS on udemy, pluralsight, this one is far the best. Jogesh is awesome teacher goes into fundamentals and this is the best introductory course on NodeJS. I am doing my regular day job and I am taking the course on side, the length of the weekly class is longer and it is harder for me to finish the class every week, that is just me. Thanks a ton Jogesh. "
7004,Amazing and very informative! Highly recommended!
7005,good.
7006,Pretty Good
7007,I enjoyed this course 
7008,"While a lot of useful ground was covered, it was a constant struggle simply getting my environment to work properly - the entire specialisation needs to do a better job of getting users on a level playing field with better environment setup."
7009,for begginer is very easy and explicit.
7010,"Excellent teaching.First of all, i thank Dr.k.Muppalla for such wonderful teaching with good exercises.this course will help all those who want to learn about web services."
7011,Great course and great professor!
7012,good
7013,"very great course with lots of new concepts also not very fast like another courses ,lots of examples there to try"
7014,"I don't like the fact you have to pay 80 dollars just to unlock assignment submissions. The fact that other students have to grade each other is not worth the 80 dollars. Think of all the students that may attend the course will more than cover the server costs if it was 10$. Otherwise, the class so far is useful."
7015,"Excellent course for those who want to drive into nodeJS and mongoDB. Theory, practice and assignments are perfectly constructed and presented in a structured, informative way. For me, it is exactly the course I needed. Thank you,Nikita"
7016,I liked it as a way to start developing a nodejs backend.I wished that it would have gone a bit deeper in some topics.
7017,Great Course!!
7018, Excelent! 
7019,Excelent!!!
7020,"It's a good course that covers a good amount of rich material in a short amount of time. Wish there was some more explanation on certain plugins we are using outside of just 'this is what you do'. Course files would help quite a bit when completing assignments, especially with the amount we are modifying our local projects."
7021,"Thanks to Professor Muppala this course becomes very modern, useful and easy to understand!Enroll and have fun!"
7022,Great course! 
7023,great course. very complete and thorough.
7024,this is really helpful to me to develop my own web project. i wondered how nodejs operate with mongoDB. Thank you to professor and coursera.
7025,Thank you good course
7026,Excellent. Well structured and good balance between theory and practice. 
7027,Great Course!!!!
7028,great introductory stuff to node js
7029,good course?????????????????????
7030,Not a very good course. The assignments are not very clear. Could have done much more like integrating front-end etc in place of that loopback module. Was really disappointed with this one. Should have given 0 stars but gave 3 stars for Jogesh Muppala as he is my favourite teacher when it comes to MOOC
7031,Thanks to the instructor for the great course. The course gives the possibility to dive into node.js
7032,Amazingly charismatic teacher. :)
7033,Excellent course to get deep introduction to Node.JS!!
7034,Awesome!
7035,A good introductory course spanning full-stack server side development. I liked the structured flow of lessons and excercises. A great minus though is that this course has little to none focus on testing. While in the middle of this course I lack insight into testing strategies with node js.
7036,Pretty good course. I wouldn't be able to learn so much on my own.
7037,Good
7038,It's the best.
7039,Well designed and rich stuffed course
7040,??timo curso!??timo conte??do!??timo instruto!
7041,Excellent course. Well structured and includes great information. 
7042,What a awesome explanation. Like it ..Thank you very much providing the session with live examples. Very much useful course to get clear idea of the topic.
7043,Remarkable
7044,Great course and great specialization!!!! I have learned a lot!!!!
7045,Amazing course! Prof. Muppala makes it very very to understand the concepts. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to understand the ways of Node.js/Express/MongoDB.
7046,"Highly recommend - the course is brilliant, and I tip my hat to the professor for his 'node' of genius. Well structured, well explained, well detailed. Thank you for this wonderful specialization!"
7047,Very GoodThanks Alot
7048,course and professor are great!
7049,"Till now, the course is really great! "
7050,all right!
7051,"This series is superb, you can get from beginner to advanced level in fullstack web &amp; mobile development if you religiously consume all the materials and teachings provided in this series. Professor Rogesh is an awesome instructor who spares no effort to provide us with consummate instructions. What's the best thing? You get a real, working products of your own when you finish this series. You will also get to deploy your product in the Capstone project and hence, I strongly recommend this specialization for those who are serious at developing a web product."
7052,Excilent 
7053,"Muy buena la explicacion, en algunos temas se pasaron detalles por alto pero en lo general muy descriptivo"
7054,"Excellent. Complex functionallity, simple explanations."

7134,thank you
7135,"Great overview of designed and organic data collection! I feel more confident interpreting and understanding survey results and providing input on community-based research projects. Some of the readings were challenging for me because I have not studied statistics, but it was a welcome challenge. I plan to return to some of the course materials after completing a stats 101 course. I took the survey questionnaire design course in this specialization two years ago and I wish I'd taken this first. If you're thinking of sampling courses from this specialization, I highly recommend you start here. "
7136,"This course is extremely hard to follow, not because of the content but because of the delivery. Presentation, visuals, word choice, speed, all very poor. I'm in week 3 and EVERY video has been just as difficult to follow. Quizzes are hard to understand and ask you about things that weren't of any actual value to the course, and/or weren't even covered. Also, because multiple answers are required for each question, you are basically answering a 4 part question that is only worth 1 point. Get one part wrong and you miss the whole 1 point. "
7137,One of the most informative courses I have ever taken. 
7138,"This course is no joke. I struggled. I do not have a background in statistics or research but took it as pro dev for what I do in my job as a system administrator (admin for our university's survey tool). Excellent content, great introduction. Opened my eyes to how much I DONT know. Will be pursuing the rest of the specialization."
7139,Stunning cutting-edge topic to convey Data Science results.
7140,Thanks
7141,Excellent.
7142,The course content was good but teaching method was too poor to understand. First time little disappointment by coursera.com
7143,this course is really good. i enjoyed a lot. 
7144,I think this course gives the basic &amp; important knowledge about survey and data collection. Some can feel the course boring. But I believe the important knowledge boring sometimes.
7145,"AWFUL monotonous way of talking. I have such a great interest in this topic, but listening to her makes me want to rip my eyeballs out."
7146,Great overview of the survey process. Instructor presented information in a concise manner. Highly recommended. 
7147,Excellent introductory course!
7148,This is an excellent introductory course. It provides the learners with all the basic information required to understand surveys.
7149,Great overview of data collection and analysis. 
7150,"An entremely good effort, gives you a wonderful introduction to the wonderful world of Survey Research in general and data collection overall. One of the plus point is that it directs you towards quite a few new sources of data that is pretty interesting if you are an active researcher. "
7151,really helpful. and nicely thought!
7152,This is a rare course that teaches data collection framework from the ground up.
7153,An extremely thorough overview on overall survey design methodology.
7154,"The deliver papers are great but slides are poor. In overall, a good course to begin learning about Data Collection and Analysis."
7155,Gives a basic overview of data collection processes.
7156,"A good overview of surveys and data collection methods. The Total Survey Error framework is good, but its application isn't shown as strongly as it should be. Regardless this is a good primer for future material."
7157,"I think the videos could be more dynamic, however, the course is very structured."

Some of the readings were challenging for me because I have not studied statistics, but it was a welcome challenge. I plan to return to some of the course materials after completing a stats 101 course. I took the survey questionnaire design course in this specialization two years ago and I wish I'd taken this first. If you're thinking of sampling courses from this specialization, I highly recommend you start here. "
7160,"This course is no joke. I struggled. I do not have a background in statistics or research but took it as pro dev for what I do in my job as a system administrator (admin for our university's survey tool). Excellent content, great introduction. Opened my eyes to how much I DONT know. Will be pursuing the rest of the specialization."
7161,Stunning cutting-edge topic to convey Data Science results.
7162,Thanks
7163,The course content was good but teaching method was too poor to understand. First time little disappointment by coursera.com
7164,this course is really good. i enjoyed a lot. 
7165,I think this course gives the basic &amp; important knowledge about survey and data collection. Some can feel the course boring. But I believe the important knowledge boring sometimes.
7166,Great overview of the survey process. Instructor presented information in a concise manner. Highly recommended. 
7167,Excellent introductory course!
7168,Great overview of data collection and analysis. 
7169,"An entremely good effort, gives you a wonderful introduction to the wonderful world of Survey Research in general and data collection overall. One of the plus point is that it directs you towards quite a few new sources of data that is pretty interesting if you are an active researcher. "
7170,An extremely thorough overview on overall survey design methodology.
7171,"The deliver papers are great but slides are poor. In overall, a good course to begin learning about Data Collection and Analysis."
7172,"A good overview of surveys and data collection methods. The Total Survey Error framework is good, but its application isn't shown as strongly as it should be. Regardless this is a good primer for future material."
7173,I like it. So far so good
7174,Nice Course for Java Beginners 
7175,"Perfect course for intermediate programming in Java. Great teaching method, detailed explanations, and excellent professors."
7176,"Great Course Indeed. Using Maps and Applets through code was my first time experience, and it was great.A must course for Java Programmer."
7177,"Fantastic course that does exactly what the tutors say. You feel challenged all the way without ever feeling overwhelmed, and the projects are so much fun to do. I just finished my degree in Computer Engineering and this course filled so many gaps in what I already knew. Congratulations to the MOOC team and UC San Diego for creating this amazing course and specialization. You guys rock!"
7178,"Great course! It seems a little bit easy at the beginning, but soon it becomes hard enough. "
7179,One of the best course I have done on coursera. Everything is awesome about the course final project helped to extensively test my skill. This course is for learner with basic knowledge in java.
7180,"Some of the concepts after week 2 were very tough for new begineer's in JAVA language. Moreover concepts of ArrayList, Generics, HashMap, Abstract Data Types should have been discussed in short videos before the module in which it is to be implemented to such a great extent.Overall a great course for someone looking to gain confidence on working large projects. Support videos were great though"
7181,Great course with the right levels of difficulty. Certainly a must be for beginner Java developers
7182,Very interesting tasks with map.
7183,"This course is great to dive into real development. However, GUI Development in Java is not the most popular directions nowadays."
7184,"Came from the predecessor specialization by Duke, which was really great. So I had high expectations for this course.But this course introduces not much new (only some library using), no new programming concepts. I also didn't like the programming assignments (one big project). They were not challenging at all (much too easy), and also not really interesting (repetition and expansion of an assignment at Dukes). You are also not writing that much code, because you get too much from them, where you just have to add a little here and there. Liked, that they divided the videos into different stages (core, concept challenge, when I struggled), so you only have to watch the videos, that you find necessary.I hope the next course will be more interesting and challenging."
7185,"Very well guided course. Enjoyed the programming modules. The right difficulty and guidance to achieve the programming assignments without having to have interactive help from tutors. I feel like the lectures also gave me a good holistic view that is often missing from online courses. Thank you, I will recommend this course."
7186,Solid intermediate course
7187,Very good course and extremely well designed lectures
7188,great! i love this course
7189,Good material and good videos.
7190,"Being a self-taught programmer, this really filled in a lot of gaps for me. Thanks!"
7191,Very easy to follow and learn.; especially lecturer Mrs. Mia's videos are very good and lively.
7192,Excellent lectures. Assignments were fun but sometimes the instructions could have been a little clearer.I learned a lot so I would recommend it to others.
7193,It's an awesome course. Course instructors are great at teaching. MOOC students can enjoy extremely while doing the projects.
7194,Good course but grade can be subjective.
7195,Very good courses!!
7196,I loved this course. Professors are great at explaining the concepts and the programming assignments are fun and challenging. Definitely recommend. 
7197,It is awesome! Thanks to the Professors for a wonderful package.
7198,Great course for reviewing the Java programming language. It??s challenging enough for someone who has previous knowledge of programming and Java so it can serve as a way of evaluating your knowledge and further it a bit more. 
7199,It's really helpful to learn or consolidate those basic but important knowledge!
7200,A well organized and clear course for intermediate learners and people who want to review some fundamental topics about OOP and Java. Make a project based on what you are learning through the weeks is a big plus. Teachers and all the material are very good.
7201,"Mia, Leo and Christine teaches object-oriented programming in Java very well. The course is based on a very interesting map project which makes learning very fun."
7202,"Great class overall. I found the week on inheritance to be especially good. Very clear explanations, examples, and illustrations which is so important in a fundamental CS class like this."
7203,wonderful course i like the way of teaching........
7204,Excellent
7205,great course and fun assignment!
7206,This course was awesome. They taught each and every concept in such a flawless way with additional conceptual challenges. Really loved it. 
7207,"Course structure and material were great and well-planned. Best thing about the course is the project they have you build, it really sharpens your skills and gives you ability to apply what you have learned right away."
7208,Good course. Lectures clear and concise. Programming exercises interesting and challenging.
7209,I have learnt so much from this coure.I thank coursera.
7210,A good course to further improve java knowledge and get acquainted to its features through a very interesting project!
7211,"A good course. The user of unfolding maps makes it a little confusing at times, but on the positive side it provides and example that could be of practical use when creating programs in future."
7212,"very well structured, with good examples and video explanations"
7213,Great Course!
7214,"excellent course ,and the guiders are very supportive and this course going to help me in future with large benefit and successes"
7215,The new concepts were provided in a way that was very simple to incorporate. The project is fun to develop and the teachers were very clear in their lessons.
7216,"Very interesting Course and the way the instructors give the lessons are great and easy to follow. The concept challenges are also, very good, because it makes you test yourself if you really understand the concepts or not. "
7217,"Great course, learned a lot"
7218,"very nice introduction to classes, subclasses and iterfaces. The final project took me a serious effort but i think this is all about commitment. i got stucked for few days but when you find the solution to your problem is a very addictive sensetion"
7219,"The core content of the course is really good. On the downside, there is, in my opinion, too big a focus on the unfolding map mod. I would have preferred to code objects from scratch. "
7220,"I expected much more in this course. In my point of view, a very long time was spent to learn how to draw something in the screen. I thought this course would be focused in Object Oriented Programming and all about the best practices, why not? But it didn't, sometimes was very hard to go on with this. Anyway, thank you all."
7221,Must have if you begin to learn java.
7222,Best course to learn object oriented programming
7223,"One suggestion i give to you that, please level of difficulty increase in a way that the learner not face to much thing in a single assignment. So, create assignment like that learner learn less thing but accurately. For example in this assignment you only build a relations between classes and marker on a map for only CityMarkerMap.java class and in the next module you implement LandMarker.java and so on. So, please this is my request in the future make assignments in a way that the Learner less thing but efficiently and accurately."
7224,"I signed up for this course hoping for a good introduction to OO programming and Java only to not be able to verify if I have even learned anything. Of course I can access the course material, but the fact that cannot even manually check if my answers are correct with certainty makes all of this less efficient than simply learning it by myself."
7225,Well designed Online course. Easy to learn. Clear explanation of the concepts. 
7226,wonderful experience with coursera 
7227,The challenges with questions and demos are very useful.Helps for a good understanding.
7228,Great course !!
7229,Thank you guys for this massive information you put in this course. I appreciate your efforts well explanation you guys awesome 
7230,Very Practical and the project is quite engaging. I'm a structural engineer and thought the earthquake map project was related to my interests in seismic design and automation/visualization of pertinent data.
7231,"the course is good, but I'd like to have more challenging assignments, maybe I had a little bit more knowledge than it is required for this course."
7232,Excellent course.
7233,Nice use of both the processing API and google APIs. 
7234,great course!very useful
7235,Great explanation....
7236,I appreciate the time and effort invested by the Instructors and their members for making such an excellent course! It was a wonderful learning experience. . 
7237,"nice course, for the future I suggest to add more assignments."
7238,This was a very good course. I learned a lot! :)
7239,Very much helpful in making the OOPS concepts strong.
7240,"Very comprehensive and detail explanation about OOP in Java and very decent assignment, recommended for people who wants to learn and become good at OOP in Java."
7241,"Great course, very good explanations and examples. "
7242,Overall the course is good. A bit too short.
7243,"This is a first course that I finished in Coursera. The course is great. The core project for this course is the unfolding map. Through the project, you can learn a lot of stuff about java. The three teachers are all great. :)"
7244,This course has been well put together with sufficient number of exercises to get started on OOP in Java.
7245,Awesome course... Must have for anyone who wants to test his/her programming skills with real world data...
7246,The course does not allow students to take part in quizzes before paying for it.but the quality of the course material is amazingly high and easy to follow.
7247,very good information and very useful content.
7248,Very good Course. Best explanations through good examples. If assignments were programming rather than objective it would have been much better.
7249,Nice Course!At least make the assessment of graded materials available to auditors!
7250,"I'm still in the course but I have never seen a start so easy in programming, they guide you in everything, they have a path for you, now this, is education. :)"
7251,"Very good course. It started a bit slow and sped up abruptly in Week 3, but overall a very good course."
7252,"Awesome Subject , awesome instructors and that implies this is a awesome course. :)"
7253, theoretical and practical balance
7254,A great thanks to coursera and the instructors for building this course.. It made me fall in love with JAVA.
7255,5 stars for teachers.4 stars for the TA/mentor.They only answer the technical questions like setting up the environment but seldom answer the question about understanding the program.So you need to figure out all the new problems by yourself alone and can not get help.Sometimes it's a waste of time.
7256,Concepts explained very nicely.
7257,really enjoyed!
7258,"I would give additional stars if it was possible. Some prior programming experience is required (I think they already specify this as a prerequisite). That said, if you just done basic programming but never used GUI libraries before, this is THE BEST POSSIBLE INTRODUCTION to using libraries. Must say a word about the course structure, material and the professors. They are all, yes all three of the professors, in one word: AMAZING!! Their tone is encouraging and it is a privilege learn from them. The course structure, again 5 stars. A combination of the CORE and concept challenges cleared up any muddled up concepts in my head. So analyzing and understanding the support code was a breeze (it took me multiple attempts and umpteen reviews of the videos to get this far in the course but I am definitely more knowledgeable and competent than before I started) The course material is really good.I am highly motivated to complete this course and go for the next one provided by this dedicated team of fantastic teachers."
7259,"i really like the coding project in this course. the project is collecting everthing you learn from the lecture, after you refreshing them all and doing the project, you will find out you have the you java skills re-polished and shape. "
7260,cool! teacher is nice and course is very useful!
7261,Great lesson! Great course!! Congrats! :)
7262,"Amazing work!!! Guys, please do not stop and continue!"
7263,Great course! Worth much more than each penny you put! 
7264,Definitely great material and awesome teachers
7265,I'm enjoying. Thank you very much
7266,I found it very useful in bridging the knowledge gaps I had in Java. I helped me identify issues which even seasoned programmers miss.
7267,This course is really well prepared. 
7268,Great introduction to OOP 
7269,it's perfect
7270,Pretty good basic course. Easy explanations and useful skills. Good for start when you have some basic knowledge behind your back.
7271,great
7272,Good practical things taught here!
7273,"Super! Real life situations are used to explain OO principles. Although real life is complex the course manages to simplify it and make it understandable, so OO principles are learned step by step. Programming assignments are fun! "
7274,"I really enjoyed it, it covers some basics of java and it's challenging for those who already worked on java"
7275,"Absolutely brilliant teaching , clearing of basic concepts. A must take course for someone who has learned a little bit of java previously and is ready to dive in to the depths of it."
7276,Good for enhancing your object oriented programming skills. Recommended for novice Java programmers. Well explanation and a nice way to understand concept challenge. 
7277,"This was an excellent course in Java programming. My entire programming experience prior to this course was my own reading of Java basics from tutorialspoint.com. So, basically little to no experience. With this being an intermediate course, my learning curve was quite steep. But the 3 professors have done an excellent job of creating an interactive and challenging learning experience.The lectures are engaging and on point. I love the format where they tell you an overview of the assignment ahead of the week's lectures. This way, you can associate ways of using things learnt in the lectures while you learn them.I also loved how the assignments built up from being quite easy to very challenging over the course. Each passing week uses skills acquired from all the preceding weeks, offering a nice continuity that aided my learning. Overall, my entry into programming was made thoroughly enjoyable through this course and I'd like to thank the team that created this course for it."
7278,Great course for beginners in OOPS with JAVA.
7279,"Course was great, learned so much! Audio levels on the videos was a tad quiet."
7280,"The material is explained really well, and there are many concepts that are introduced that it helps set a good foundation in OOP. The project is pre-built which is the only thing that I didn't enjoy a lot, I would have preferred starting everything from scratch as I think it would help cement the stuff learnt even more."
7281,Good cool course 
7282,This is a nice and very challenging course. But definitely learned a lot. Thanks to the instructors..
7283,Good course for basic OOP in java. Thank you.
7284,Simple and playful tutorial.
7285,very good course for foudamental.
7286,Instructors are not to be found.
7287,Nice course.
7288,Great course
7289,very helpful
7290,ok
7291,Amazing course with very useful contents and hands on.
7292,Great introduction to Java and OOP!
7293,Very good start for object oriented techniques and the way java works.
7294,Very good course with very good explanation of concepts.
7295,Thanks a lot!Please keep up the good work.
7296,Solid introduction to object oriented programming in Java
7297,Excellent Course!!! Very Challenging.
7298,I am very satisfied with the course.it was nice.
7299," Very interesting. The lessons are clear, engaging and concise . I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to improve their programming skills."
7300,"One of the best programming courses I have ever seen, specifically for people who are learning to program."
7301,Very good course for beginners.
7302,Basics
7303,Over my expectations! The videos are very clear and oriented to learning. The structure of the course can't be better and the teachers are really good!. 
7304,"Excellent course, excellent teachers!"
7305,"For me it can be difficult rating courses that cover material that I've already seen in some form before because sometimes it's the repetition that causes a concept to click. However, having never used Java, this really helped me to get a more solid grasp of OOP basics. The instructors are awesome and the pacing is just right. "
7306,It's very useful course but if it was dealing with java built in classes it would be better to be a start course in specialization 
7307,loved the course. the overview of the course is nice. like a lot.
7308,mind blowing
7309,This course is excellent..I've never felt so happy while learning about programming concepts
7310,I Thing this platform is provide complete knowledge about which kind of Course you wan
7311,excellent for beginners
7312,very good overview of the fundamental concepts of Java
7313,The course teaches Object Oriented Concepts In Java in a fantastic way that makes understanding them fairly easy. Three cheers for the Professors!
7314,Awesome course in OOP in java 
7315,"Covered Java and OOP very well. Good projects, as well."
7316,"An awesome course to refresh or learn oops concepts ,the project is also very good and the best thing is that the course is taken by amazing teachers."
7317,"The course comes with great explanation but the graded assignments sometimes seem pointless as they look irrelevant to the topic, There are unnecessary questions asked in quizzes i.e whether you have completed your assignment or not. These sort of questions never evaluate what we have accomplished "
7318,Good course very helpful for beginners
7319,Great course
7320,Impressive and wonderful content.
7321,I liked the How I struggled and Challenge videos. The course itself was challenging to me and I learned a few object oriented programming concepts that can help me at work.
7322,"This is a brilliant course. Starts from the basics of object oriented programming covering all the topics in intermediate details. Also, the final assignment helps you to add additional features and test your creativity! A must for beginners and a good course to review the fundamentals of OOAD."
7323,Very basic Course. It involves a lot of GUI Concepts which may not be useful for general programmers.
7324,"I loved the way instructors designed, developed and delivered course. This course gave me really good insights into object oriented programming. And I thoroughly enjoyed working on project."
7325,"Thanks for this course, I never thought that Java programming would be so easy and clear to understand."
7326,Most usefull for beginners
7327,best explanation . kristine was my favorate mentor :)
7328,"It is a good course. It help me strengthen the knowledge about interface, abstract class and experience of developing related skills."
7329,I loved this course. All the basics of java are well explained and got to learn many internal things. Thanks for this course.
7330,too fancy and the structure is not very clear. Not very much learned.
7331,Tremendous. That's a real teaching!
7332,This course was an exceptional introduction to programming Java applications. The course content and project were both very practical and fun. 
7333,"Great course, especially if you have some background in programming. With a lot of help from the lectures you develop a real life proyect since week 1, which is pretty awesome. The instructors' explanations are clear and simple. I had never had any contact with Java before and I feel like I have learned a lot. Thank you so much for this course! "
7334," The course is really good , you will learn many basic stuffs about object oriented programming concepts "
7335,"Great course, it covers fundamentals of OOP and Java. I think it is a great course for one who starts learning Java.How materials are divided is awesome if you need a little help, you can get just wathcing another video, if you want to keep yourself challenged you can skip some. I liked this approach. "
7336,Good course!
7337,Best Java course I've seen. I love the way the lecturers teach. It's so cool. 
7338,it's good for me to know about java by the map program.
7339,great
7340,"A very good course! At the beginning it might look simple, but gets challenging after the first two weeks. "
7341,Great Course for learn and implement the experience gained from this course.
7342,I am impressed by this course. Keep doing good job! 
7343,"Great teaching and presentation, Thanks"
7344,Really excellent thorough explanations and great examples. This course filled in some holes in my understanding about the fundamentals of the language. 
7345,It seems great!
7346,it's a nice course and helped me understand the object oriented design with JAVA very well!!!
7347,Awesome for beginners! Introduce Basic concepts and then practice on a map project.
7348," Great course! The course teaches us the basics of OOP concepts. Moreover, during the course students are able to use theory in practice. "
7349,A highly detailed course. It helped me learn Java well outside the domain of the classroom.
7350,Excellent Course! 
7351,Good.Project need to be has less dependency considering the offline users and limited machine capability.
7352,Best course ever ..
7353,Great! This course is very helpful!
7354,Very good Fundamentals
7355,"Nice course, to starting with java."
7356,awsome course
7357,"good lecture, and good explanation. Fix my two knowledge missing point even after i graduate from college."
7358,I learn a lot about Java and object oriented programming. I enjoyed the course.
7359,Love the course. I have learned few new things on this course. 
7360,very nice
7361,awesome practice and good GUI framework
7362,So useful course.many thanks
7363,i Love this course and wanted to complete this course
7364,"It was really cool. I have been working as a Full stack developer in java since 2014, but I learnt and understood core concept very well. Thank You for these sessions."
7365,A good course and beautiful lectures. But the programming assignments should be little more tough.
7366,Excellent Professors the way the concepts were delivered was superb got the chance to learn alot. 
7367,awesome!
7368,This course open my eyes for the IT world!! very well done!
7369,Its nice to me and very helpful for me.
7370,"This is a solid course. The videos are a bit low quality, and the API's used are sorta derpy, but the content is good. "
7371,The explaining part could have been better.
7372,"When I signed up for this course I had already taken a year's worth of Java classes and was quite well prepared. My overall opinion of the course is that it was really good and the instructors did a good job by presenting clear videos of some beginning - intermediate level concepts. I especially liked Christine's and Mia's presentations. The videos on memory models were really great and helped me a lot. The assignments were really interesting too as they collected and mapped real time data of earthquakes onto a map, but some of the external libraries being used in UnfoldingMaps could have been explained a little better as to what their implementations were. In the beginning it was a little confusing trying to figure out the superclasses even though the Javadocs for them were available. I also felt that the Interaction Design Lab in Germany - the folks who implemented the UnfoldingMaps could have made the Javadocs of their classes a little more detailed. Further explanation of how to use the classes built into the course would have been very helpful. Hence the 4/5 stars given. But overall I really enjoyed the class and am really looking forward to the second class in the sequence. Well done!"
7373,I liked the course a lot. It is really useful for intermediate java learners and most importantly I made some thing very cool which I liked the most.
7374,Very easy to begin with and very interesting project
7375,Excellent for basic understanding about the Java language.
7376,I love this course. It is easy to catch the whole idea.
7377,good for understanding. Challenges are awesome.
7378,"So far it is going great !, In my case just doing the basis again but It is well made for overall students"
7379,Great course. Very well structured with real world experiences. Hats off to the staff for their efforts.
7380,One of the best courses I have founded if you are new in the OOP paradigm.
7381,"Good course, but topics covered are mixed with Java GUI library, Algorithm, OO of Java language. It would be good if this course can focus on OO feature of Java only."
7382,very interesting course i like it's had core fundmentals of java programming and very easy understood describe everything including memory model
7383,Must-take object-oriented programming course for intermediate programmers.
7384,pretty good but expected more of helping writing own programs 
7385,coordination is required between the lectures and the assignments so a to fill any gaps
7386,help a lot
7387,very good
7388,If I could finish exam without fee will be perfect
7389,"Great introduction to Java. Gives you an opportunity to play with several different libraries from the start, rather than learning the basics with just text input and output like most courses, which is really cool. No peer review, just quiz questions that can only be answered if the assignment is completed correctly. The assignments are therefore not particularly challenging -- you get out of this class what you put in!"
7390,Java is great and I love it!!Study!!
7391," OOP explain Clear , i like this course"
7392,Really help on building up good foundation of OOP. 
7393,best corse in java
7394,"Interesting project, great pacing. The lectures are well designed and presented. The additional videos (quick interviews with industry vets, students figuring out a selection of code) are useful to reinforce understanding. Most of the knowledge here transfers smoothly (with syntax adjustments) to other languages and stacks, such as C#."
7395,Very good course. Much more challenging than I expected. Definitely helped me become a better programmer.
7396,This is a excellent course !
7397,Very clear and helpful. So far I love this course!
7398,"This course is just awesome. A tough one for beginners, but the effort really pay off. "
7399,"Nice course for beginner. I, specially, like the memory model lectures. "
7400,Super~
7401,"Very good course, it gives good knowledge about the important parts of java such as inheritance and polymorphism. "
7402,"Very informative, fantastically organized ....though video quality(even high) is a bit disappointing :( but is is so enjoyable!!!!!! Enjoying it greatly :D :D "
7403,Its an awesome course very interesting and insight :)
7404,Very Good!
7405,I like this class. I found the answers there on many tricky programming questions such as memory allocation for objects. I will recommend this class to all my friends who is interested in computer science. 
7406,I have learned quite a bit on thinking about code. Memory models especially was a new concept for me. Now I can take that skill and apply to bigger projects if I want to run through and understand that better. I also like that we can watch students talking over the code. Awesome course and great personable teachers. 
7407,"I like a lot GEO-Information-Project, it is very interested in many ways, I never handle with this type of project, It is very challenging for me."
7408,Basics taught in a very clear &amp; simple way. Thank you!
7409,The professors handled the classes exceptionally well. I thank all of them for helping me learn something. But I felt the course a little hard as the documentations needed to be referred properly to work with the objects.
7410,"This class is superb! While doing the project, I am learning concepts gradually and the functionality of my project is also growing during the process. Perfect learning experience."
7411,really good explanations and gave a kick start to new comers.
7412,Great course! I have learned a lot.
7413,"I learned some new skill, that will be of great use in my career"
7414,Very cool
7415,I have been following this course since mid 2015 and I found it very good. But because of my busy schedule I usually switch the session. But this time I am really motivated to devote some time for this great course to learn OOP. I have learned a lot in my university about java programming but they did not teach us these stuff which are practiced. we solved a lot of problems there but they had nothing much about using java libraries and OOP. Thanks all the lecturers from UCSD and Coursera for such a great course.
7416,This course is amazing! Really help me a lot to know more about Java Programming. 
7417,It's an interesting course.
7418,"The teacher is very comprehensive and very serious. I was starting to learn Java, thanks."
7419,Very professional and inspiring
7420,very interesting and well thought out course.
7421,It is good!!! I learnt a bit of Java beforehand but not the object oriented concept. Would definitely attend the courses by UC San Diego again as well as pay for the course when I can afford it!
7422,Worth taking
7423,This course was a journey. The instructors helped in successfully passing out the material in a interesting and helpful way.
7424,fun hacking
7425,The closest experience to the real programming job i had so far 
7426,"in the beginning of the course i thought i'll get a good experience as usual on coursera, but i was wrong ... a lot of things &gt;&gt; to be introduced in next courseconfusing data types &amp; working with things i don't know about it.you've said that, anyone with basics of programming could pass this course and after 6 months i couldn't. please be sure about the prerequisites next time. "
7427,"Good beginner content, touches on some good foundations for java"
7428,I had some difficulty with English (I am not a native speaker): in some lessons it comes quickly and then you need the use of subtitles. I also studied some concepts with the use of Java manuals.
7429,"Comprehensive, enough amount of quizes and suitable assignment to ensure your understanding and give you enough practice. Nicely planned. I have really benefited from it."
7430,good instructors and good course material :)
7431,"Excelete! Muito did??tico e tem aulas bem explicadas, al??m das suppot classes que ajudam muito tamb??m, recomendo!"
7432,I hpe that I won't pay 79$ just to have a certificate.
7433,Nice!!!
7434,OOP in Java was a fantastic course! The syllabus was really good and the assignments were really cool!
7435,"Considering the contents of the second and third course, this was too basic."
7436,Good Expaination
7437,The best specialization I've seen on Coursera. The course material is good and each to understand. Great 1st programming course for beginners.
7438,Loved it Interactive learning and good implementation of all the theory taughtWould recommend everyone to check it out.
7439,Very good
7440,I like the content and programming assignments.
7441,Very good series for learning Java and OO Principles. The big application approach is very interesting as we can see the whole picture even when we know little yet. The interviews with software engineers are very enlightening.
7442,"very good for beginner, thank you "
7443,Great
7444,It's a wonderful course. Covers all the basic concepts of OOP and provides the knowledge to develop an interesting and interactive application. The instructors have a student friendly teaching technique . This has helped me a lot. Thanks to the staff of UCSD and coursera.
7445,I really see the ease in which this somewhat complex concepts are explained and gradually introduced.
7446,"Very well structured, clear explanations, and great additional resources to test and repeat the material. Thank you very much!"
7447,"The course is insightful and intuitive. The professors have done a great job. If you are already a programmer in some other language, you might find some topics a bit primitive but the project that is at the end of the module should be a good exercise even for the experienced programmers. And, to recreate the entire project on your own would be a great exercise. It will also gear you up nicely for the next course in the specialization."
7448,very nice course and assignments
7449,"Excellent course, highly recommended for all my friends"
7450,great work by the professors at uc. its like moving slowly and steadily from primitives to complexity and there's no stress involved.
7451,I loved that we went over basic algorithms. Most beginner classes don't do that.
7452,"This is a very well organized course, which shows clearly that the professors in charge have put real efforts to create its syllabus and training code. I have had a significant benefit by going through the course, and it helped me to implement OO techniques in a very detailed way. I highly recommend this course."
7453,Learned a lot about OOP programming. The assignments were fairly challenging. 
7454,"Great Course! Challenging, but the instructors help you to do it!"
7455,The course was well-structured to provide resources and guidance to complete a fun project; the instructors did an excellent job of making the material accessible and providing real-world examples of how the material is relevant beyond the scope of the class project. 
7456,Excellent!
7457,Amazing course with amazing teachers .Worth every penny .
7458,"This course delivers a great learning experience. I have not only learned the theory of object oriented design through java. I have also gained hands on experience of these challenging concepts through the java programming assignments. An outstanding feature of this course is the ability of the three professors to relate rigorous theory to hands on experience by means of the java assignments. Hats off to three outstanding Computer Science professors for the great teaching, enthusiasm and ability to motivate me the learner. This course delivers 100% on its promise to provide a solid foundation in object oriented design and programming through java."
7459,Nice Java-centric introduction to OOP!
7460,"An excellent course for taking a step forwards in Java programming. The instructors are great and I love the concept challenge videos as they help clarify new concepts.The programming assignments are good although sometimes felt like they were not challenging enough. The course material isn't that long and the course could easily be completed in 2-3 weeks or even less.Despite that it is not an introductory course to Java, I was able to follow along smoothly without prior Java experience. However previous programming experience is required."
7461,excellent course given by excellent instructors. 
7462,"One of the best online courses I've seen. At first, total beginners can be a bit overwhelmed, but you gain confidence every week. Big thanks to UC San Diego and Coursera!"
7463,"This course was a really comprehensive package explaining all the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming . The instructors clearly explains the concepts of inheritance , polymorphism , searching , sorting etc. relating it as much as possible to real world examples. The concept challenge questions clearly helps you to understand the subtle nuances that the instructor wants to explain . The quiz are easy .The only thing that i found hard was to complete was the final assignment as i had minimal programming experience with data structures but if you stick to it , you will definitely make it , just like me :)"
7464,The peer review assignment part is really useless. 
7465,Overall I enjoyed this course and learned quite a bit. 
7466,"A great practical overview of java as a programming language. I have always learnt it in bits and pieces, so it was nice to be introduced various features of the language as well as objected oriented programming to address the growing complexity of a project."
7467,"Quite basic and sometimes a little slow for coders with some experience, but well-structured and very interesting."
7468,Loved it . Best MOOC specialization i have attended. Thanks a lot!!!
7469,Not a five star review because this course is more like an introduction to programming on Java and best fit for a beginners. So that said this course is more about programming tools and project setup than a programming at all. 
7470,tutorials are just awesome..:)
7471,Amazing course with very efficient teaching ..i really enjoyed this course . hope to see more similar courses from the teachers.
7472,Thank you!
7473,"Very good introductory course in Java and OOP principles, well designed and structured, provides perfect programming assignments."
7474,"Es un curso b??sico de programaci??n en Java, un poco lento si ya tienes experiencia pero comunica muy bien los conceptos con explicaciones claras."
7475,"Excellent lectures, the subject matter is very well detailed and enough support is given to the student."
7476,Great course
7477,good !!! I love it !!
7478,This class was a great refresher and continuation of the OOP methodology. 
7479,"Good course, but a few loose ends that could be tightened up. Definitely helped with my rusty java skills."
7480,Excellent course and dynamic!!!! The programming assignment are funny and help the student to improve knowledge.
7481,A very good course with a direct application in an interesting and engaging project. The video lectures are well structured and lots of additional information is provided. I would recommend this course to all java beginners. 
7482,Better than any other java course.
7483,Excellent way to start learning Java
7484,"A very comprehensive course, that digs deep into the intricate details of Java - for beginners. Although the third module was challenging and had scope of improvement by explaining briefly what all the objects and methods meant, I managed to comprehend it."
7485,Enroll this course if you intend to become a programmer and need fundamental knowledge in Object Oriented Programming. Here you can study the subject and apply new things in a real curious project.
7486,I was a beginner to JAVA when i had started this course. But after completing this course i am very confident with JAVA concepts. Great course by great professors.
7487,"This is definitely one of the best courses I have taken. The presentations, resources, and projects are very creative and well designed. The what do you want to cover next quizzes tempt you to try things on your own before looking for help, which is a nice teaser. The only reason I give it 4/5 is that a few of the project instructions were too vague to figure out what they were asking for (i.e. without asking)."
7488,Awesome course
7489,great course
7490,Nice explanation of inheritance &amp; consctructors
7491,Excellent specialization
7492,Little bit tough.Very good course
7493,"Having taken introductory courses in Java, this was the perfect stepping stone to greater confidence and skill with using Java libraries, and has also given me a greater understanding some underlying fundamentals such as scope. Highly recommended."
7494,This is a well thought and made course. I reccomend it to any programmer or data scientist out there!
7495,"This is a great course. This is the first time I learnt an online course, which has so many advantages against traditional classroom instructions. "
7496,A ???well-knit coursework and pretty straightforward approach towards understanding concepts in OOP that comes with a good project to practice on.
7497, An exceptional course in intermediary programming! 
7498,"Love this course, the quality of this course is far beyond to what my current online master degree offers. "
7499,"Great course to understand the basics of OO programming. Hierarchy, Interface, Abstract Class notions very well pointed out.Note: Wouldn't recommend if you are an absolute beginner."
7500,Just an amazing course! Thanks for the great work
7501,Great course ! The professors that participated have a huge talent at explaining and sharing their knowledge !
7502,"A great introduction to the fundamentals of building real-world software, with an engaging project (world map of earthquakes) that you continuously evolve throughout the course and a unique, friendly approach to programming assignments."
7503,"Highly recommended, worth to apply for the specialization!."
7504,The project is very interesting.
7505,"I'm taking the course to review Java/data structures. The material is appropriate, well-explained, and well structured."
7506,Excellent Course
7507,Perfect for newbie!
7508,"Awesome course.Assignments are fun and I got a lot of things to learn.I was good in Java before starting the course, but still learned a lot."
7509,Great Course! the lecturer and the learning flow is good...
7510,Awsome course!
7511,Good course for learn the principles of oop with java.
7512,Great course! For both beginners and intermediate Java programmers
7513,Very useful.
7514,"It's a relatively short and easy course, but it has good lecture videos and programming assignments.Also, I think that you would have to already have fairly good computer programming skills (either in Java or some other language) to take this course, because it pretty much jumps right into adding complex functionality to existing programs to extend their behavior."
7515,"Good course, ideal for the first half of a second course in computer science. A little java experience is recommended buy you'll probably be ok if you have program in a statically type programming language before because you can pick up java very quickly. The lectures are very good, I think that the teachers are excellent expositors but I feel that they could be more detailed. The project is about representing earthquakes in a map and you are always increasing the complexity. Finally you need to add your own extension which I found an excellent opportunity to test your imagination and your capacity to create new things. The only cons of the course for me is the way assignments are evaluated. I think it has to do with the fact that they are interactive. You have to answers questions in a Quiz related to the week content and the project. But the are not very demanding, therefore they do not reflect how much you really know. In general I recommend taking this course if you are in self study journey in computer science, even more the specialization start to get more interesting and demanding in the follow up courses, more complete and detailed."
7516,Very Good Course. The Programming Assignment were a bit challenging. It first looked all alien but the Instructions were very helpful and I enjoyed a lot while doing it. This is the best course I have taken up on Coursera and for that matter any online course.It was very interactive. Thank you Coursera. Keep it up
7517,Nice Course I like the way of providing resources and support forum.
7518,Excellent course
7519,"It needs project based exams, not quizzes. These project exams should be a combination of automated programming tasks, like the kind you find on HackerRank or Codeforces and peer assessment based projects that asks students to evaluate the readability of each others code. As it currently stands, this course is a joke. "
7520,Excellent course! I really enjoyed this!
7521,Very good course
7522,It is a very good class for learning Java! The three teachers are very excellent and nice. 
7523,Very good course. It explains in simple way all basic material that you must know about OOP. 
7524,"I really enjoyed taking this course, very elegant style of teaching with such a nice hands-on project. "
7525,"After almost finish this section, find that the most thing I have done is stuck on Casting and solve this problem (It takes 2 hours frustration + 30 minutes the rest). "
7526,Lots to learn
7527,Great course
7528,excellent!
7529,A very well constructed materials provide deep understanding of the OOP core concepts.Do not hesitate enrolling.
7530,Very well taught by very intellectuals.
7531,I learned quite a lot and the course work was easy to follow and build knowledge from lesson to lesson. I enjoyed the projects as well.
7532,Very great job. It should recommend a bibliography though.
7533,"The concepts are not new to me, but I really enjoy the real-world projects which makes a lot of sense."
7534,"Great course and provides some complex and awesome context. This is my first programming course in java, although it has taken me a bit to get my syntax right, it has gone smoothly."
7535,Sometimes the person who is speaking it doesnt inderstand very wellSome exercises it doesnt understand very welltheyll asume you yave more experience that they wanted for this course.I think it would be if they give more examples and exercise for the assigmentsregards
7536,Excellent course! very challenging class
7537,The best course I saw in Coursera. A lot of efforts will deployed to make the learning experience optimal. Bravo for the professors.
7538,great course!!!
7539,Very helpful introduction to OOP course
7540,"The topics are covered perfectly in such a way that every learner can digest the content by spending some time on them. After that, learners can able to learn most of the basics of OOP. The homeworks are also well designed and helpful. Thanks to the creators of this course and the instructors. "
7541,Very Nice Course thx 
7542,"really explicit and easy to follow up, nice preparation and nice content."
7543,Came to know memory models and OOBS concepts.
7544,Great Course :)
7545,Perfect course!
7546, This course is an opportunity to learn how to use objects and clearly understand the purpose of its use. Provides the necessary tools for programming with the best practices.
7547,This class was extremely well structured. The assignments provided excellent opportunities to thoroughly learn the course material. I would highly recommend this class.
7548,Very clear. 
7549,The course is very good explained. However the practice relies a lot in code that cannot be explained like applets or mapping components... Sometimes you need more time to go through the documentation of a graphic library that you will never use again than in doing the actual assignment's core thing.
7550,"The only complaint I have about this course is the horribly irritating music at the beginning of each lecture video. I would have my headphones in, volume up so I could hear the lecturers clearly, then when the next video would start there would be this terrible music that started very abruptly. If I was very quick I could mute my volume until it finished, but I think this is totally unnecessary. PLEASE consider changing this, as it will affect my decision to pursue further courses in this specialization"
7551,Peer reviews was unfair. It's must be any methods to exclude inadequate learners from reviewing. Blacklists is only one way to stop them now.
7552,"Great introduction to OOP with Java. This is not a pure theoretical course, neither a entirely practical course... It is both, so the instructors present the material with a good balance between theory and practice. Part of your assignment tasks is to explore on Java classes and learn how to use their methods (functions) in your own programs, which gives you a taste of a daily programmer job. The end of course project stimulates your creativity!Nonetheless, this course will be challenging for someone who has not been exposed to any OOP concepts before. Make sure to practice a lot and go to the discussion forums, which are a great resource for help, at any moment you need it."
7553,A little more about interfaces and abstract classes should be added to understand the concepts better
7554,A very good course for people who are interested in Java
7555,Loved the Unfolding Maps application! Great way to learn object oriented programming. Really enjoyed the extension project at the end.
7556,I got a lot of fun while doing this course.
7557,Great course. The exercises have found it very good. I have learned a lot
7558,Simply a brilliant course ! Thanks.
7559,Excellent contents!
7560,"Excellent approach to teaching Java; i loved the hands on, concept challenges and modules at the end of each course. I wish my professors in university were 1/2 as good as them."
7561,very helpful 
7562,"very well structured, maybe even a bit too much at some times :)"
7563,"Christine, Mia and Leo - you are absolutely fantastic! To convey programming concepts with such enthusiasm, dedication and professionalism! The course is well designed and planned. The assignments are very interesting and actual. I would definitely recommend this course in my professional circles and to my friends. Thank you very much! In pleasurable anticipation of your next course. Thank you."
7564,It's very well designed and explained.
7565,"Coursera gives Universities the flexibility to show their own style of teaching and sharing knowledge.I really love this course, good project.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------However, good course is not only the instructor's' responsibility, but also the students' active involvement.I rate 4 because we need more students get involved in developing this course like creating wiki notes.Extra material to read etc."
7566,Excellent course material. Taught very well. Interesting challenges.
7567,Nice course. But peer assignment/reviews takes much more time than estimated 30 minutes.
7568,Outstanding course. It's readily apparent that the course developers put a lot of thought and effort into this course. The mapping example that was used throughout the course was a good choice.
7569,"Thanks a lot, very interesting course."
7570,"Very interesting course, not for complete beginners. The project is quite interesting. You will defintely learn a lot here. I recommended for any Java leaner student. "
7571,Very good teachers/instructors.
7572,"Every instructor explains the concept in a nice and clear way. The course structure they designed is very logical and well organized. So, it's very easy to follow. Plus, they did a very good job picking core topics in OOP.A must-take class if you're interested in OOP."
7573,very helpful~~~~
7574,"Great course, thank you! What i really like it's in this course you learn by doing interesting practical projects, not just listening theory only."
7575,Blown away by this course. Hands down the best I've taken on Coursera and in the running for best course ever. The manner in which the professors taught and tested us through the Concept challanges really clicked with me. Kind of wish I went here for undergrad. UC San Diego courses haven't dissapointed me so far. I am really excited for the next one in the specialization.
7576,This course provides right stepping stone for OOP concepts as well as Java.
7577,very good
7578,"Excellent course! 100% recommended! Despite I had a strong background in computing and I found it a little bit easy, I really enjoyed the lectures and programming assignments and I have learned some interesting stuff. In my case, I know how to program but I have coded in Matlab for too long. So I am finding the whole specialization very useful. "
7579,"This course helped me understand key concepts of Object Oriented Programming. By doing the weekly assignments, I had a chance to practice what I have learnt straight way. "
7580,So far so good! I am really excited for this course
7581,This course helps me a lot with understanding Java.
7582,It could provide deeper concepts with more examples.
7583,If you are a beginner in OO not recommend .
7584,"Its been a productive journey since my concepts about OOPS are crystal clear. I would surely enroll in more courses provided by UC,San Diego."
7585,Excellent course. Starts from scratch. nice clear explanations. Project based teaching is awesome. Hats off to the UC faculty 
7586,Excellent and practical course.
7587,Good introduction to JAVA for the intermediate developer.
7588,Really exceptional course. Make sure you watch the everything its easy to miss important information about the assignments.
7589,Excellent course. Some courses that are object-oriented start with simple variable declarations and they are extremely boring to work through as there is very little progress in each week. Others assume you know a lot and they are very confusing. This one is very good if you have been exposed to programming before and want to learn object oriented approach. It isn't too easy or hard. Instructors take the time to explain concepts rather than simply using them. Highly recommended.
7590,Very intuitive! Easy to understand! Good!
7591,Core concepts of OOP are explained very well in this course. Assignments were quite practical in nature and implementing them was challenging and fun. I would recommend the course to anyone who wants to strengthen and formalize their knowledge of OOP concepts.I wish assignments would be submitted for code review and students would be able to get more specific input from mentors on code organization and style. Integrating with github would be a great step forward towards transparency as well.
7592,Incredibly Good! Improve my Java Skills in the next level.
7593,"I learned many useful things in this class. The concepts were explained very well, and the assignments were challenging. However, I do wish the assignments required submission (I realize this was implemented in the second course). "
7594,I highly recommend this course for Java programmers. Very practical.
7595,"The course is really great and the explanations are very clear! Instructors are so inspirational! I think the good idea is to develop such a project from scratch, without using given starter code. Thank you a lot!"
7596,Well organized and designed. 
7597,Great Course for Java Developer...:)
7598,"Great course, excellent for a programmer with beginner Java skills, and perhaps a better intermediate grasp of another language such as Python, wanting to dive a bit deeper into Java with appropriate explanations."
7599,"This is one of the best series of courses I came along in online MOOC platform, such a brilliant course, this whole specialization is brilliant, such a interesting projects, I'm disappointed that I live in country that isn't that much wealthy to help this Specialization and to be able to do Capstone Project , but I wish all the best hope to finish all in time, this is in my top 3 online MOOC Courses and I saw a lot of them.I wish all the best to this team and people that made this possible."
7600,"University of California did a great job!Thank you guys!Great course, concept challenges are very helpful and surprisingly one additional week for finishing up was wonderful idea - it helped me to finish last assignment on time. "
7601,Rly good course
7602,Muito bem. Ensina Java profundamente. Voc?? aprende muito. Muito obrigado aos professores.
7603,Well taken by the teachers. The bugs in the review system are the only problems I faced.Hope they get rectified soon.
7604,Very oriented Program
7605,Good and challenging ~ !
7606,"It was a wonderful course! Kudos to all the professor! I wish i was lucky enough to be under the tutelage of such great Professor! Loved how lucidly, they made us understand Java.Special mention to Christine. You were absolutely fantastic!And to the Coursera Community. You guys rock! Bless you guys. You have no idea how much you are helping students like me. Looking forward towards more such tutorials.PS: Can i expect J2EE tutorials from these professors? And also, some course on Algorithms from these Professors? It will be very helpful.Thanks,Arya"
7607,"Easy to comprehend, full of examples, a lot of challenges, excellent teachers, and everything! I love this course's programming assignments as those assignments show me directly the real application of each week's topic.The most extremely valuable thing that I got from this course is that I now can read documentation properly. I thought that reading documentation is tedious, but now I know that it is very fundamental."
7608,Very rigourous course. Very worth the time and effort. Taught real knowledge and skills while facilitated building a portfolio
7609,Great course to get new students started with Java. The project keeps the students engaged and interested. 
7610,A challenging course but very rewarding
7611,Love the teaching style.
7612,it was awesome. Thanks a lot !
7613,it was awesome. If you really want to lean java than pick up this course for learn with doing something.
7614,Awesome
7615,Great course. 
7616,Very good!
7617,I love how you learn to follow the code by writing where it's in memory. I've been stuck on classes work internally and now i'm glad how they work
7618,"A nice ending project, but other user reviewing can be unreliable. The diagrams were still helpful, and made the videos more comprehensive."
7619,A really great course
7620,"awesome, benefits me a lot"
7621,Great course!
7622,Great course.
7623,Very good course
7624,"Super course. You get through a lot of aspects of object oriented programming in JAVA. The course has a very good balance between learning, doing and thinking."
7625,"great, lots of useful practice assignments with detailed explanations."
7626,This course is fantastic. Thanks you Coursera. 
7627,A good practical overview of Java language with good exercises that emphasize the course contents.
7628,"Best at the current moment, considering the content and in comparison to the program being offered by other mooc's"
7629,Is a great course is really and fully well desingned.
7630,"Just Completed 1 week , awesome content and lectures , best"
7631,Great Course
7632,This course is good for any range of students from novice to experienced programmers . 
7633,"It is very useful, especially the example framework they have with the maps and worldbank data"
7634,Practical project experience can be obtained!
7635,"This course is for programmers that wanted to improve their techniques and knowledge of the language, since the course shorts videos with real life experiences, that give you advices on how their abilities and produce quality programms."
7636,Not a difficult course but teaches you much about Java.
7637,Great Instructor and a nice way to teach us. Liked every single lecture. Enjoyed the project too.
7638,"This is course is really awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested to Software Engineering using JAVA programming Language.A little history about my background will help understand my excitement about this course. I am a newly graduated in the field of Electrical Engineering. So far, I wrote code mainly in C++ and I have not really participated to very challenging programming assignments. Looking for job (Unluckily so far ) I quickly realize that Java programming is really big on the job market. For these reasons, I got this book in Java programming called Starting Out with JAVA, but may be due to lack of discipline I was not really able to move deeply in book. However since I have enrolled in this course, I am being influenced tremendously by the design of the class.I got so much positive vibe from the professor who make this class really exciting. The level of details use in lecture videos make this class really easy to follow. In addition, the class assignment are just plainly cool, practical, and challenging. I really feel like I am learning from expert in the field. This fact has raised my confidence that my gaining the skills combined in this specialization I magnify my qualification on the job market.Thank you."
7639,I loved this course and I believe I gained some valuable skills and knowledge by taking the course. 
7640,"Very crisp explanations. Treatment on polymorphism was very good. The only thing I did not like was that we were forced to cast a few times during our assignments, and usually this is not a good practice to be taught to someone."
7641,Instructors are exemplary. This series is the best crafted that I've seen on-line. Makes me look forward to the next week.
7642,I am learning from this course and thats far more better
7643,Well structured content and great explanation on concepts. I really like the concept challenge portion as it helps dig into the application of the concepts explained in the lecture. It would have been better if the lecture slides were available in pdfs.
7644,excellent
7645,"Great intro to polymorphism, casting classes, sorting and datastructures"
7646,Very sad that this is no longer free
7647,Thank you for the cource!
7648,Designed in a very interesting way. Really helps to understand the things and get in their flow.
7649,"amazing course, i really enjoyed while learning ^_^"
7650,"Excellent course with great content. The only problem is that there's a bit less administrative assistance in the discussion forums than perhaps preferable. Aside from that, this course was fun, and while some parts were strenuous, I enjoyed taking it!"
7651,"Always wanted to be a softawe developper, this course is very informative for the beginners. Many thanks to teachers of this course!"
7652,Very helpful course that gives you tools to start doing your own projects. Loved the final project task! 
7653,"I liked the way that the professors insisted on understanding the mechanics behind the concepts learned, using the memory models and asking for that pen and paper for drawing them.I didn't find any pdfs with course notes containing the concepts discussed in a written form but I think I'll relisten some of the videos and write that notes for myself.I managed to understand quite a few object oriented concepts that were blurry for me before, thank you for that. Now, it's practice time, to avoid forgetting all that !"
7654,I've learned a lot an it was fun to work with actual data :)
7655,"I learnt some good tricks on this course, it came at the this time for what I was doing at work. I recommend this course as it covers most of the basics, and encapsulated difficult parts, all you do call a method to do something."
7656,"Really fun, light introduction to the specifics of Java"
7657,"Its a good course to take. As we learn OOP in a better understandable way. Instructors explain the concepts well. Also I always like working with maps and as this course assignments are based on map data, plotting data on real maps it like it more. But it would be great if the course have taught to execute the same code through java jar. As using Papplet via eclipse is easy but how to use the same code via computer terminal is quite tricky as we don't find any main method in our code."
7658,"I have learned a lot. But i have always been falling back in he course because i am a working.just struggling a lot to be on the Deadline, and that's what keeps me pretty involved and enthusiast and dynamic.!!! .....Thanks A ton.............$$$$...............!!!"
7659,Excellent!
7660,Well done MOOC. Material was very clearly presented by excellent instructors.
7661,Awesome!
7662,Good
7663,Excellent course!
7664,"It's just started on the first week, but the professors of this course already make me really excited to learn."
7665,Great! 
7666,The videos that aren't boring and long! This course filled in the gaps that I had after taking university classes. I don't really like the final project is peer reviewed. Your peers can prevent you from passing the course. 
7667,Very good introduction to Java programming. It definitely helps to be familiar with Java already and one should really be able to read code and deduce what it does in order to do well on the quizzes.
7668,This is an awesome course for OOPs
7669,"Good explanations, easy examples and easy to follow"
7670,Excellent
7671,"Really great course! I have leant a lot, very interesting!"
7672,Good explanations and fun project.
7673,Interesting course to achieve.
7674,Great course. Well designed and challenging programming assignments that stimulate learning.
7675,great course! 
7676,Excellent course for beginners
7677,Amazing course!!
7678,This course really presents the concepts of OOP amazingly well. 
7679,It was very useful and well structured course. I'd like to thank all creators of this program for their excellent work.
7680,Excellent Course for JAVA novices. 
7681,Great course for basic knowledge about Java programming.
7682,Awesome course.
7683,"Good course, but the project of map isn't so clear."
7684,Terrific course!
7685,"Great course! The activities were nice, and challenging. The instructors did a good job of explaining things in diverse ways."
7686,Excellent. Look forward to the others.
7687,I'm really exited about this course! Really professional team which provide us very interesting tasks! brilliant! Not....Tremendous!! 
7688,A great course before beggining working in Java. Well structured with a great demo project. The course clearly illustrates the use and practice of OOP concepts in a fun way.
7689,Good course with it i better understand the java structure.
7690,"I really liked the structure of the course, and also the course contents."
7691,"While the material is relevant, the exercises required too much specific knowledge that was not discussed in lecture. For an experienced programmer, most of the exercises were easy, but I admit I had to look ahead on two of the projects because the instructions were too lacking. The final project was too open ended and made me not want to finish this course. Overall, I would not recommend this course."
7692,Thanks for this course
7693,Cannot follow a single thing that they are talking about. I have prior coding experience in other languages and I still have no idea what the instructors are getting at. They all explain everything horribly and jump into huge complex things with no explanation. Worst course I have ever taken in my life. 
7694,I like this course!!
7695,Nice course well explained. I liked more than other courses where they explain easy theory then you are lost in the assignments.
7696,Covers the basic concepts of JAVA and a idea of how to implement GUI's.Everyone should enroll in this course.
7697,nice..
7698,Excellent!
7699,Decent Introductory course for someone who is a newbie.
7700,"Pefrect course for beginners like myself. Everything was really well explained but not too slow either, the way things were presented was easy to follow, but also interesting; touching subjects close to real life problems we might encounter. Last, but not the least (on contrary), lecturers were really easy to listen, they explained everything well, but the feeling wasn't too strict or overly professional. It was a joy. :)"
7701,Good pace and interesting topics. Getting ready to take the next one.
7702,"Although I agree that the mapping library that is used for the programming assignments adds something visually interesting to the course, I felt that it added an unnecessary level complexity when it came understanding the object-oriented aspects of the language. I spent a lot of time trying to understand how to use a library that I won't likely use again just to be able to apply the core programming concepts being taught in that lesson. Having said this, I felt a good sense of accomplishment after getting through the final project."
7703,good course to start learning java with OOPS
7704,Was great I enjoyed the whole project working with processing applets
7705,Perfect for beginner/novice programmer who want's to take the next step.
7706,Very well created
7707,Great structure. Really enjoyed the different learning paths.
7708,A very complete course with wonderful videos and assigments.
7709,"Good, well paced course. Big advantage is the short duration of the video-lectures. I prefer a few short ones over one long lecture."
7710,starting from week2 the way of explaining the materials isnt good 
7711,Really enjoyable and I learned some absolutely great skills!!!!!!
7712,genios????????
7713,Awesome :)
7714,very helpful
7715,good interaction
7716,Great lesson and interesting!
7717,awesome description
7718,I reviewed and learned a lot of Java Object Oriented Programming concepts. It was really fun!
7719,I loved this course! The course videos and the projects sharpened my idea about some of the toughest concepts of Java and OOP. I recommend this course to anyone interested in learning OOP in Java. ???
7720,Liked the way Prof. has so far taught this course. 
7721,All objects related concepts are really well explained and the exercices are well designed. A great course to follow
7722,realy cleared my concepts which I wasn't able to clear from past 4 years
7723,"The lectures were too wordy and the lecturers tripped over their words too often (which wouldn't have made it so difficult to listen if the lectures hadn't been so wordy!). There was too much focus on high-level details of the course project and too little attention paid to technical details. This rendered the lectures simplistic, boring, and sometimes a waste of time. This felt like an introductory level course, made more difficult through poor teaching.Also, the slick web interface was slightly difficult to navigate in comparison to other Coursera courses."
7724,If you think this is an introduction to Java programming language you are wrong.What do you want? Do you want teach us to use Processing or teach us to program in Java?
7725,Application based approach of learning Java. Awesome!!
7726,"well organized, interesting assignments and great interactivity between the instructors and the students."
7727,For all who want to understand object-oriented programming this is the course that should be taken.
7728,"It explain knowledge in simple and concise ways. The programming project after each lesson is interesting, challenging but not too hard to solve. 5 star course! 3 teachers are all awesome. Mia is amazing!! "
7729,Excellent course
7730,Every one should take this course
7731,Amazing Course!
7732,Good for starters. Very detailed explanations of core programming principles in Java.
7733,Nice course with very good lectures
7734,boolean goodJavaIntroClass = true;
7735,"Best Java course I have seen for years. And Best team of instructors in any of Coursera courses. Hope to have later specializations from the same Instructors. I am just delaying certificate until finishing the due java specialization, as I felt it may need introductory course as advised by the great instructor ChristineGreat Instructor/Course from great University as great as the rest of San Diego university courses. Well respected Universities in addition to Duke, Michigan and Virginia Compared to the very short courses from other reputable Universities"
7736,"I like the projects, but always don't have enough time."
7737,mainly work with applets.
7738,Best Course Ever
7739,"just an google maps applet, do not explain java itself."
7740,"Some of the questions are not Java related ones at all which I couldn't see much of a helping point, e,g. What are the coordinates of rio de janeiro?. There were also a few of questions that I found a bit confusing because the code provided is plain white and it's a bit hard to focus on it. I'd rather want to customize the color of the presented code just like modern IDEs do. Everything else seems rather okay and intuitive. So far so good, guys :)"
7741,Really helpfull!
7742,Excellent teachers and examples..
7743,Give lots of information to Beginner Level users.
7744,Very confusing course for those who have no previous experience in Java.
7745,"The way the course is designed is really effective, instructors are great as well. I am loving this course."
7746,"Thanks a lot to all of the team of this Course University of California San Diego, The Professors Christine, Leo and Mia for their efforts and Style of teaching , and Coursera for the Platform"
7747,"Perfect, I've learned a lot since Week 1, It's a very interactive course and the teachers are very clear with explanations. I am in week 3 now and wow, my knowledge has been drastically increased. Note that I am tester trying the other side of the coin. Thanks for the Course UCSD!"
7748,Nicely explained and neat
7749,So far so good. I am really enjoying the review.
7750,Easy to follow!
7751,Awesome
7752,Good one
7753,superb
7754,Great course.
7755,Amazing
7756,Wonderful Course for would-be Data Scientist
7757,Awesome course!
7758,"Good work by the team behind this. I express my sincere gratitude towards all the ones behind this, and would like to express special thanks to my beloved professors.-Muhammed Swafuvan"
7759,"This is the first MOOC I have found that fits neatly between beginner level introduction to programming courses, and higher level machine learning/pattern recognition or algorithms courses. The lecture videos convey concepts succinctly, and the assignments complement the lecture materials."
7760,Excellent
7761,Nice Course for Java Beginners 
7762,"Great Course Indeed. Using Maps and Applets through code was my first time experience, and it was great.A must course for Java Programmer."
7763,"Fantastic course that does exactly what the tutors say. You feel challenged all the way without ever feeling overwhelmed, and the projects are so much fun to do. I just finished my degree in Computer Engineering and this course filled so many gaps in what I already knew. Congratulations to the MOOC team and UC San Diego for creating this amazing course and specialization. You guys rock!"
7764,One of the best course I have done on coursera. Everything is awesome about the course final project helped to extensively test my skill. This course is for learner with basic knowledge in java.
7765,"Some of the concepts after week 2 were very tough for new begineer's in JAVA language. Moreover concepts of ArrayList, Generics, HashMap, Abstract Data Types should have been discussed in short videos before the module in which it is to be implemented to such a great extent.Overall a great course for someone looking to gain confidence on working large projects. Support videos were great though"
7766,Great course with the right levels of difficulty. Certainly a must be for beginner Java developers
7767,Very interesting tasks with map.
7768,"This course is great to dive into real development. However, GUI Development in Java is not the most popular directions nowadays."
7769,"Came from the predecessor specialization by Duke, which was really great. So I had high expectations for this course.But this course introduces not much new (only some library using), no new programming concepts. I also didn't like the programming assignments (one big project). They were not challenging at all (much too easy), and also not really interesting (repetition and expansion of an assignment at Dukes). You are also not writing that much code, because you get too much from them, where you just have to add a little here and there. Liked, that they divided the videos into different stages (core, concept challenge, when I struggled), so you only have to watch the videos, that you find necessary.I hope the next course will be more interesting and challenging."
7770,"Very well guided course. Enjoyed the programming modules. The right difficulty and guidance to achieve the programming assignments without having to have interactive help from tutors. I feel like the lectures also gave me a good holistic view that is often missing from online courses. Thank you, I will recommend this course."
7771,Solid intermediate course
7772,Very good course and extremely well designed lectures
7773,great! i love this course
7774,Good material and good videos.
7775,"Being a self-taught programmer, this really filled in a lot of gaps for me. Thanks!"
7776,Very easy to follow and learn.; especially lecturer Mrs. Mia's videos are very good and lively.
7777,Excellent lectures. Assignments were fun but sometimes the instructions could have been a little clearer.I learned a lot so I would recommend it to others.
7778,It's an awesome course. Course instructors are great at teaching. MOOC students can enjoy extremely while doing the projects.
7779,Good course but grade can be subjective.
7780,Very good courses!!
7781,I loved this course. Professors are great at explaining the concepts and the programming assignments are fun and challenging. Definitely recommend. 
7782,It is awesome! Thanks to the Professors for a wonderful package.
7783,Great course for reviewing the Java programming language. It??s challenging enough for someone who has previous knowledge of programming and Java so it can serve as a way of evaluating your knowledge and further it a bit more. 
7784,It's really helpful to learn or consolidate those basic but important knowledge!
7785,A well organized and clear course for intermediate learners and people who want to review some fundamental topics about OOP and Java. Make a project based on what you are learning through the weeks is a big plus. Teachers and all the material are very good.
7786,"Mia, Leo and Christine teaches object-oriented programming in Java very well. The course is based on a very interesting map project which makes learning very fun."
7787,"Great class overall. I found the week on inheritance to be especially good. Very clear explanations, examples, and illustrations which is so important in a fundamental CS class like this."
7788,wonderful course i like the way of teaching........
7789,Excellent
7790,great course and fun assignment!
7791,This course was awesome. They taught each and every concept in such a flawless way with additional conceptual challenges. Really loved it. 
7792,"Course structure and material were great and well-planned. Best thing about the course is the project they have you build, it really sharpens your skills and gives you ability to apply what you have learned right away."
7793,Good course. Lectures clear and concise. Programming exercises interesting and challenging.
7794,I have learnt so much from this coure.I thank coursera.
7795,A good course to further improve java knowledge and get acquainted to its features through a very interesting project!
7796,"A good course. The user of unfolding maps makes it a little confusing at times, but on the positive side it provides and example that could be of practical use when creating programs in future."
7797,"very well structured, with good examples and video explanations"
7798,Great Course!
7799,The new concepts were provided in a way that was very simple to incorporate. The project is fun to develop and the teachers were very clear in their lessons.
7800,"Very interesting Course and the way the instructors give the lessons are great and easy to follow. The concept challenges are also, very good, because it makes you test yourself if you really understand the concepts or not. "
7801,"Great course, learned a lot"
7802,"very nice introduction to classes, subclasses and iterfaces. The final project took me a serious effort but i think this is all about commitment. i got stucked for few days but when you find the solution to your problem is a very addictive sensetion"
7803,"The core content of the course is really good. On the downside, there is, in my opinion, too big a focus on the unfolding map mod. I would have preferred to code objects from scratch. "
7804,Best course to learn object oriented programming
7805,wonderful experience with coursera 
7806,Very Practical and the project is quite engaging. I'm a structural engineer and thought the earthquake map project was related to my interests in seismic design and automation/visualization of pertinent data.
7807,"the course is good, but I'd like to have more challenging assignments, maybe I had a little bit more knowledge than it is required for this course."
7808,Excellent course.
7809,Nice use of both the processing API and google APIs. 
7810,Great explanation....
7811,I appreciate the time and effort invested by the Instructors and their members for making such an excellent course! It was a wonderful learning experience. . 
7812,"nice course, for the future I suggest to add more assignments."
7813,This was a very good course. I learned a lot! :)
7814,Very much helpful in making the OOPS concepts strong.
7815,"Great course, very good explanations and examples. "
7816,Overall the course is good. A bit too short.
7817,"This is a first course that I finished in Coursera. The course is great. The core project for this course is the unfolding map. Through the project, you can learn a lot of stuff about java. The three teachers are all great. :)"
7818,This course has been well put together with sufficient number of exercises to get started on OOP in Java.
7819,very good information and very useful content.
7820,Very good Course. Best explanations through good examples. If assignments were programming rather than objective it would have been much better.
7821,"Very good course. It started a bit slow and sped up abruptly in Week 3, but overall a very good course."
7822, theoretical and practical balance
7823,A great thanks to coursera and the instructors for building this course.. It made me fall in love with JAVA.
7824,5 stars for teachers.4 stars for the TA/mentor.They only answer the technical questions like setting up the environment but seldom answer the question about understanding the program.So you need to figure out all the new problems by yourself alone and can not get help.Sometimes it's a waste of time.
7825,really enjoyed!
7826,Great lesson! Great course!! Congrats! :)
7827,"Amazing work!!! Guys, please do not stop and continue!"
7828,Great course! Worth much more than each penny you put! 
7829,I found it very useful in bridging the knowledge gaps I had in Java. I helped me identify issues which even seasoned programmers miss.
7830,it's perfect
7831,great
7832,"I really enjoyed it, it covers some basics of java and it's challenging for those who already worked on java"
7833,Good for enhancing your object oriented programming skills. Recommended for novice Java programmers. Well explanation and a nice way to understand concept challenge. 
7834,"This was an excellent course in Java programming. My entire programming experience prior to this course was my own reading of Java basics from tutorialspoint.com. So, basically little to no experience. With this being an intermediate course, my learning curve was quite steep. But the 3 professors have done an excellent job of creating an interactive and challenging learning experience.The lectures are engaging and on point. I love the format where they tell you an overview of the assignment ahead of the week's lectures. This way, you can associate ways of using things learnt in the lectures while you learn them.I also loved how the assignments built up from being quite easy to very challenging over the course. Each passing week uses skills acquired from all the preceding weeks, offering a nice continuity that aided my learning. Overall, my entry into programming was made thoroughly enjoyable through this course and I'd like to thank the team that created this course for it."
7835,Great course for beginners in OOPS with JAVA.
7836,This is a nice and very challenging course. But definitely learned a lot. Thanks to the instructors..
7837,Good course for basic OOP in java. Thank you.
7838,Nice course.
7839,Great course
7840,very helpful
7841,Amazing course with very useful contents and hands on.
7842,Great introduction to Java and OOP!
7843,Very good start for object oriented techniques and the way java works.
7844,Excellent Course!!! Very Challenging.
7845,Very good course for beginners.
7846,Basics
7847,Over my expectations! The videos are very clear and oriented to learning. The structure of the course can't be better and the teachers are really good!. 
7848,"Excellent course, excellent teachers!"
7849,"For me it can be difficult rating courses that cover material that I've already seen in some form before because sometimes it's the repetition that causes a concept to click. However, having never used Java, this really helped me to get a more solid grasp of OOP basics. The instructors are awesome and the pacing is just right. "
7850,I Thing this platform is provide complete knowledge about which kind of Course you wan
7851,I liked the How I struggled and Challenge videos. The course itself was challenging to me and I learned a few object oriented programming concepts that can help me at work.
7852,"I loved the way instructors designed, developed and delivered course. This course gave me really good insights into object oriented programming. And I thoroughly enjoyed working on project."
7853,Most usefull for beginners
7854,too fancy and the structure is not very clear. Not very much learned.
7855,This course was an exceptional introduction to programming Java applications. The course content and project were both very practical and fun. 
7856," The course is really good , you will learn many basic stuffs about object oriented programming concepts "
7857,"Great course, it covers fundamentals of OOP and Java. I think it is a great course for one who starts learning Java.How materials are divided is awesome if you need a little help, you can get just wathcing another video, if you want to keep yourself challenged you can skip some. I liked this approach. "
7858,Good course!
7859,"A very good course! At the beginning it might look simple, but gets challenging after the first two weeks. "
7860,Really excellent thorough explanations and great examples. This course filled in some holes in my understanding about the fundamentals of the language. 
7861,it's a nice course and helped me understand the object oriented design with JAVA very well!!!
7862," Great course! The course teaches us the basics of OOP concepts. Moreover, during the course students are able to use theory in practice. "
7863,Excellent Course! 
7864,Very good Fundamentals
7865,"Nice course, to starting with java."
7866,I learn a lot about Java and object oriented programming. I enjoyed the course.
7867,awesome practice and good GUI framework
7868,"This is a solid course. The videos are a bit low quality, and the API's used are sorta derpy, but the content is good. "
7869,"When I signed up for this course I had already taken a year's worth of Java classes and was quite well prepared. My overall opinion of the course is that it was really good and the instructors did a good job by presenting clear videos of some beginning - intermediate level concepts. I especially liked Christine's and Mia's presentations. The videos on memory models were really great and helped me a lot. The assignments were really interesting too as they collected and mapped real time data of earthquakes onto a map, but some of the external libraries being used in UnfoldingMaps could have been explained a little better as to what their implementations were. In the beginning it was a little confusing trying to figure out the superclasses even though the Javadocs for them were available. I also felt that the Interaction Design Lab in Germany - the folks who implemented the UnfoldingMaps could have made the Javadocs of their classes a little more detailed. Further explanation of how to use the classes built into the course would have been very helpful. Hence the 4/5 stars given. But overall I really enjoyed the class and am really looking forward to the second class in the sequence. Well done!"
7870,Very easy to begin with and very interesting project
7871,Excellent for basic understanding about the Java language.
7872,very interesting course i like it's had core fundmentals of java programming and very easy understood describe everything including memory model
7873,Must-take object-oriented programming course for intermediate programmers.
7874,very good
7875,"Great introduction to Java. Gives you an opportunity to play with several different libraries from the start, rather than learning the basics with just text input and output like most courses, which is really cool. No peer review, just quiz questions that can only be answered if the assignment is completed correctly. The assignments are therefore not particularly challenging -- you get out of this class what you put in!"
7876,best corse in java
7877,Super~
7878,Very Good!
7879,"I like a lot GEO-Information-Project, it is very interested in many ways, I never handle with this type of project, It is very challenging for me."
7880,The professors handled the classes exceptionally well. I thank all of them for helping me learn something. But I felt the course a little hard as the documentations needed to be referred properly to work with the objects.
7881,"This class is superb! While doing the project, I am learning concepts gradually and the functionality of my project is also growing during the process. Perfect learning experience."
7882,Great course! I have learned a lot.
7883,"I learned some new skill, that will be of great use in my career"
7884,It's an interesting course.
7885,very interesting and well thought out course.
7886,This course was a journey. The instructors helped in successfully passing out the material in a interesting and helpful way.
7887,fun hacking
7888,Nice!!!
7889,OOP in Java was a fantastic course! The syllabus was really good and the assignments were really cool!
7890,"Considering the contents of the second and third course, this was too basic."
7891,The best specialization I've seen on Coursera. The course material is good and each to understand. Great 1st programming course for beginners.
7892,Very good series for learning Java and OO Principles. The big application approach is very interesting as we can see the whole picture even when we know little yet. The interviews with software engineers are very enlightening.
7893,Great
7894,The course was well-structured to provide resources and guidance to complete a fun project; the instructors did an excellent job of making the material accessible and providing real-world examples of how the material is relevant beyond the scope of the class project. 
7895,"This course delivers a great learning experience. I have not only learned the theory of object oriented design through java. I have also gained hands on experience of these challenging concepts through the java programming assignments. An outstanding feature of this course is the ability of the three professors to relate rigorous theory to hands on experience by means of the java assignments. Hats off to three outstanding Computer Science professors for the great teaching, enthusiasm and ability to motivate me the learner. This course delivers 100% on its promise to provide a solid foundation in object oriented design and programming through java."
7896,"One of the best online courses I've seen. At first, total beginners can be a bit overwhelmed, but you gain confidence every week. Big thanks to UC San Diego and Coursera!"
7897,"This course was a really comprehensive package explaining all the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming . The instructors clearly explains the concepts of inheritance , polymorphism , searching , sorting etc. relating it as much as possible to real world examples. The concept challenge questions clearly helps you to understand the subtle nuances that the instructor wants to explain . The quiz are easy .The only thing that i found hard was to complete was the final assignment as i had minimal programming experience with data structures but if you stick to it , you will definitely make it , just like me :)"
7898,"A great practical overview of java as a programming language. I have always learnt it in bits and pieces, so it was nice to be introduced various features of the language as well as objected oriented programming to address the growing complexity of a project."
7899,"Quite basic and sometimes a little slow for coders with some experience, but well-structured and very interesting."
7900,Loved it . Best MOOC specialization i have attended. Thanks a lot!!!
7901,Not a five star review because this course is more like an introduction to programming on Java and best fit for a beginners. So that said this course is more about programming tools and project setup than a programming at all. 
7902,"Very good introductory course in Java and OOP principles, well designed and structured, provides perfect programming assignments."
7903,"Es un curso b??sico de programaci??n en Java, un poco lento si ya tienes experiencia pero comunica muy bien los conceptos con explicaciones claras."
7904,Great course
7905,This class was a great refresher and continuation of the OOP methodology. 
7906,A very good course with a direct application in an interesting and engaging project. The video lectures are well structured and lots of additional information is provided. I would recommend this course to all java beginners. 
7907,I was a beginner to JAVA when i had started this course. But after completing this course i am very confident with JAVA concepts. Great course by great professors.
7908,"This is definitely one of the best courses I have taken. The presentations, resources, and projects are very creative and well designed. The what do you want to cover next quizzes tempt you to try things on your own before looking for help, which is a nice teaser. The only reason I give it 4/5 is that a few of the project instructions were too vague to figure out what they were asking for (i.e. without asking)."
7909,Nice explanation of inheritance &amp; consctructors
7910,Excellent specialization
7911,Little bit tough.Very good course
7912,A ???well-knit coursework and pretty straightforward approach towards understanding concepts in OOP that comes with a good project to practice on.
7913, An exceptional course in intermediary programming! 
7914,"Love this course, the quality of this course is far beyond to what my current online master degree offers. "
7915,"Great course to understand the basics of OO programming. Hierarchy, Interface, Abstract Class notions very well pointed out.Note: Wouldn't recommend if you are an absolute beginner."
7916,Just an amazing course! Thanks for the great work
7917,Great course ! The professors that participated have a huge talent at explaining and sharing their knowledge !
7918,"A great introduction to the fundamentals of building real-world software, with an engaging project (world map of earthquakes) that you continuously evolve throughout the course and a unique, friendly approach to programming assignments."
7919,The project is very interesting.
7920,Excellent Course
7921,Perfect for newbie!
7922,"Awesome course.Assignments are fun and I got a lot of things to learn.I was good in Java before starting the course, but still learned a lot."
7923,"It's a relatively short and easy course, but it has good lecture videos and programming assignments.Also, I think that you would have to already have fairly good computer programming skills (either in Java or some other language) to take this course, because it pretty much jumps right into adding complex functionality to existing programs to extend their behavior."
7924,"Good course, ideal for the first half of a second course in computer science. A little java experience is recommended buy you'll probably be ok if you have program in a statically type programming language before because you can pick up java very quickly. The lectures are very good, I think that the teachers are excellent expositors but I feel that they could be more detailed. The project is about representing earthquakes in a map and you are always increasing the complexity. Finally you need to add your own extension which I found an excellent opportunity to test your imagination and your capacity to create new things. The only cons of the course for me is the way assignments are evaluated. I think it has to do with the fact that they are interactive. You have to answers questions in a Quiz related to the week content and the project. But the are not very demanding, therefore they do not reflect how much you really know. In general I recommend taking this course if you are in self study journey in computer science, even more the specialization start to get more interesting and demanding in the follow up courses, more complete and detailed."
7925,Excellent course
7926,"It needs project based exams, not quizzes. These project exams should be a combination of automated programming tasks, like the kind you find on HackerRank or Codeforces and peer assessment based projects that asks students to evaluate the readability of each others code. As it currently stands, this course is a joke. "
7927,Very good course
7928,It is a very good class for learning Java! The three teachers are very excellent and nice. 
7929,Very good course. It explains in simple way all basic material that you must know about OOP. 
7930,Very well taught by very intellectuals.
7931,I learned quite a lot and the course work was easy to follow and build knowledge from lesson to lesson. I enjoyed the projects as well.
7932,Excellent course! very challenging class
7933,great course!!!
7934,Very helpful introduction to OOP course
7935,"The topics are covered perfectly in such a way that every learner can digest the content by spending some time on them. After that, learners can able to learn most of the basics of OOP. The homeworks are also well designed and helpful. Thanks to the creators of this course and the instructors. "
7936,Great Course :)
7937,This class was extremely well structured. The assignments provided excellent opportunities to thoroughly learn the course material. I would highly recommend this class.
7938,"The only complaint I have about this course is the horribly irritating music at the beginning of each lecture video. I would have my headphones in, volume up so I could hear the lecturers clearly, then when the next video would start there would be this terrible music that started very abruptly. If I was very quick I could mute my volume until it finished, but I think this is totally unnecessary. PLEASE consider changing this, as it will affect my decision to pursue further courses in this specialization"
7939,Peer reviews was unfair. It's must be any methods to exclude inadequate learners from reviewing. Blacklists is only one way to stop them now.
7940,"Great introduction to OOP with Java. This is not a pure theoretical course, neither a entirely practical course... It is both, so the instructors present the material with a good balance between theory and practice. Part of your assignment tasks is to explore on Java classes and learn how to use their methods (functions) in your own programs, which gives you a taste of a daily programmer job. The end of course project stimulates your creativity!Nonetheless, this course will be challenging for someone who has not been exposed to any OOP concepts before. Make sure to practice a lot and go to the discussion forums, which are a great resource for help, at any moment you need it."
7941,Loved the Unfolding Maps application! Great way to learn object oriented programming. Really enjoyed the extension project at the end.
7942,Great course. The exercises have found it very good. I have learned a lot
7943,"very well structured, maybe even a bit too much at some times :)"
7944,It's very well designed and explained.
7945,Nice course. But peer assignment/reviews takes much more time than estimated 30 minutes.
7946,Outstanding course. It's readily apparent that the course developers put a lot of thought and effort into this course. The mapping example that was used throughout the course was a good choice.
7947,"Thanks a lot, very interesting course."
7948,Very good teachers/instructors.
7949,This course provides right stepping stone for OOP concepts as well as Java.
7950,"Excellent course! 100% recommended! Despite I had a strong background in computing and I found it a little bit easy, I really enjoyed the lectures and programming assignments and I have learned some interesting stuff. In my case, I know how to program but I have coded in Matlab for too long. So I am finding the whole specialization very useful. "
7951,"This course helped me understand key concepts of Object Oriented Programming. By doing the weekly assignments, I had a chance to practice what I have learnt straight way. "
7952,This course helps me a lot with understanding Java.
7953,If you are a beginner in OO not recommend .
7954,"I learned many useful things in this class. The concepts were explained very well, and the assignments were challenging. However, I do wish the assignments required submission (I realize this was implemented in the second course). "
7955,I highly recommend this course for Java programmers. Very practical.
7956,"The course is really great and the explanations are very clear! Instructors are so inspirational! I think the good idea is to develop such a project from scratch, without using given starter code. Thank you a lot!"
7957,"Great course, excellent for a programmer with beginner Java skills, and perhaps a better intermediate grasp of another language such as Python, wanting to dive a bit deeper into Java with appropriate explanations."
7958,"University of California did a great job!Thank you guys!Great course, concept challenges are very helpful and surprisingly one additional week for finishing up was wonderful idea - it helped me to finish last assignment on time. "
7959,Great course to get new students started with Java. The project keeps the students engaged and interested. 
7960,Love the teaching style.
7961,Great course. 
7962,"A nice ending project, but other user reviewing can be unreliable. The diagrams were still helpful, and made the videos more comprehensive."
7963,A really great course
7964,Great course.
7965,A good practical overview of Java language with good exercises that emphasize the course contents.
7966,"It is very useful, especially the example framework they have with the maps and worldbank data"
7967,Practical project experience can be obtained!
7968,Not a difficult course but teaches you much about Java.
7969,Great Instructor and a nice way to teach us. Liked every single lecture. Enjoyed the project too.
7970,I loved this course and I believe I gained some valuable skills and knowledge by taking the course. 
7971,"Very crisp explanations. Treatment on polymorphism was very good. The only thing I did not like was that we were forced to cast a few times during our assignments, and usually this is not a good practice to be taught to someone."
7972,Instructors are exemplary. This series is the best crafted that I've seen on-line. Makes me look forward to the next week.
7973,Very sad that this is no longer free
7974,Thank you for the cource!
7975,"amazing course, i really enjoyed while learning ^_^"
7976,"Excellent course with great content. The only problem is that there's a bit less administrative assistance in the discussion forums than perhaps preferable. Aside from that, this course was fun, and while some parts were strenuous, I enjoyed taking it!"
7977,Very helpful course that gives you tools to start doing your own projects. Loved the final project task! 
7978,I've learned a lot an it was fun to work with actual data :)
7979,"I learnt some good tricks on this course, it came at the this time for what I was doing at work. I recommend this course as it covers most of the basics, and encapsulated difficult parts, all you do call a method to do something."
7980,"Really fun, light introduction to the specifics of Java"
7981,Great! 
7982,Very good introduction to Java programming. It definitely helps to be familiar with Java already and one should really be able to read code and deduce what it does in order to do well on the quizzes.
7983,"Good explanations, easy examples and easy to follow"
7984,"Really great course! I have leant a lot, very interesting!"
7985,Good explanations and fun project.
7986,Amazing course!!
7987,This course really presents the concepts of OOP amazingly well. 
7988,Great course for basic knowledge about Java programming.
7989,Awesome course.
7990,Terrific course!
7991,"Great course! The activities were nice, and challenging. The instructors did a good job of explaining things in diverse ways."
7992,Good course with it i better understand the java structure.
7993,"I really liked the structure of the course, and also the course contents."
7994,"Pefrect course for beginners like myself. Everything was really well explained but not too slow either, the way things were presented was easy to follow, but also interesting; touching subjects close to real life problems we might encounter. Last, but not the least (on contrary), lecturers were really easy to listen, they explained everything well, but the feeling wasn't too strict or overly professional. It was a joy. :)"
7995,Good pace and interesting topics. Getting ready to take the next one.
7996,"Although I agree that the mapping library that is used for the programming assignments adds something visually interesting to the course, I felt that it added an unnecessary level complexity when it came understanding the object-oriented aspects of the language. I spent a lot of time trying to understand how to use a library that I won't likely use again just to be able to apply the core programming concepts being taught in that lesson. Having said this, I felt a good sense of accomplishment after getting through the final project."
7997,Was great I enjoyed the whole project working with processing applets
7998,Perfect for beginner/novice programmer who want's to take the next step.
7999,"Good, well paced course. Big advantage is the short duration of the video-lectures. I prefer a few short ones over one long lecture."
8000,good interaction
8001,I loved this course! The course videos and the projects sharpened my idea about some of the toughest concepts of Java and OOP. I recommend this course to anyone interested in learning OOP in Java. ???
8002,loved it - fascinating subject and more detail than you could possibly want from the course instructors. Friendly community in the forum too.
8003,"By far the laziest course set up in the track. It's an interesting topic, but without independent study I would have learned almost nothing due to the lack of any practicals in this Practical Machine Learning. A really disappointing course that fails to be worth more than just a couple hours of youtube."
8004,Some of the content are not designed in a way easy to digest especially for a novice people doesn't have a lot of background like me. I have to use google and read out of the lecture excessively to understand some of the points that were jumped or not mentioned in the lecture. Maybe they are self-evident to people in the domain of machine learning but they were hard for me. I wish the lecture could have explained them in more detail in a plainer way. 
8005,Fantastic Class!
8006,I enjoyed detailed information and was very straight forward to understand.
8007,Great Course!
8008,Very fine course in machine learning where the focus is more on the use of ML rather on the theory behind it i.e. the course title fits its contents.
8009,"This course really demystified machine learning, and provided practical steps and guidance on how to create predictive models. While I do wish there were more resources on how to tune models and investigate specific model parameters, I understand that there just wasn't enough time. I couldn't imagine a better course for a solid foundation in this skill."
8010,Good
8011,Good in introducing caret package and getting some experience in running algorithms. Was expecting more in-depth discussion about the methods though.
8012,Interesting the final assignment. 
8013,"I learned so much in such a short period of time. Challenging, very hands on, great theoretical foundations! "
8014,This was definitely a challenging course. I learned a lot about building and testing prediction algorithms. The course also helped me overcome the feeling of intimidation by providing excellent examples and a hands-on final assignment.
8015,Great as an introduction for someone with no practical experience. Lectures are too theoretical and lack some examples to translates the theory into practice
8016,Good
8017,I didn't enjoy the supporting materials and the quizzes weren't very interesting. The final project was fine.The subject is super interesting.
8018,ok
8019,Very useful course. Great tutors. 
8020,"First I want to thank very much the instructor in the online forum. He helped me a lot at the end of the course and his tutorials for gh-pages are excellent. He was also very fast in responding. Thank you. The course did ultimately not really gave me what I was looking for. Maybe too may different facts and not enough depth. I am not sure that I can confidently say that I can build a ML model now. Technically I can, but the deeper understanding is missing. For example: When would I use which method (for example rf versus naive base), the last exercise about cross validation was not fully clear. Using the caret package is too high level for a learner. It would be better to see some more step by step examples. It was not clear to me what the expected error calculation in the last exercise was really looking at. Maybe what is missing a swirl exercises, not using caret. and then explaining how caret can simplify it. We also learned how to create a predictive model, but did not go into how the model gets updated and gets retrained, an important aspect of ML. i also do not see unsupervised learning to be covered. "
8021,good course
8022,Best course of the programme. Simple and explained well.
8023,"This is such a cornerstone topic to the Data Science Specialization that I think it deserves a better designed and more polished curriculum. The subject is so extensive that it might be worthy to split the contents in two courses. Finally, I would like to suggest the authors of the course modeling the curriculum following the amazing treatment of the subject found in Introduction to Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshiriani et. al. "
8024,Really hands-on compact introduction!
8025,Jeff Leek is a great professor .The delivery of the course material is very clear and covers a lot of predictive methods by using mainly R's caret package. Recommended for sure. 
8026,"This course was a big let-down compared to other courses in the specialization. It doesn't seem like a lot of effort went into course planning and creation. Much of the content is unclear and there is little depth. course textbook, and some swirl exercises would have helped."
8027,Excelente curso!
8028,Very good summary of strengths/weaknesses of various machine learning algorithms. This lecturer's style and production quality is much higher than in the previous two courses in the specialization series.
8029,"Yet again an excellent course by Jeff, Roger and Brian. Thank you very much for a well layout course and some good excersizes."
8030,"Good course on the whole, learned a lot and enjoyed it, but it would need to be updated and corrected (certain bits of code don't work as they did when the course was produced, which can be pretty confusing). Would be nice also to add some more content at the end of the course : the lecture about unsupervised prediction felt rushed, and a proper conclusion opening up to the rest of the field would be useful. Anyway thanks again for this wonderful learning opportunity, keep it up ! Cheers"
8031,This course is a good introduction to machine learning algorithms with R
8032,"very good, but if it has swirl practice like th other courses it would be perfect."
8033,"So why four stars vs five stars, of all the Data Science Certification courses that I have taken: i) some of the examples and quiz challenges don't work as they should, ii) Machine Learning is rapidly changing area - should be updated to reflect this and perhaps a high level taste of Deep Learning, iii) posting the Final Project is overly complicated relative to methods of the other courses - this should be cleaned up - still not clear how point to a github repo link and also have a rendered html page working from that same link - requires two links to present materials and must use default names like index vs. a project name."
8034,"Very shallow content - broad, but not deep. Not many assignments instead of the last one. We hear what we heard before. For the same price, Analytics Edge at EdX is far better choice for practical machine learning."
8035,excellent!
8036,Very useful course to develop level knowledge in machine learning. 
8037,Very good course. The content can be enriched with some more technical details behind the various techniques. There needs to be 1 more course on Practical Machine Learning in the specialization as 1 course is far too less for such a vast topic.
8038,"Nice, clear and concise."
8039,Instructor rushes the course and does not explain much in the same level of details as respective quiz requires
8040,"Issues of every stage of the construction of learning machine model, as well as issues with several different machine learning methods are well and in fine yet very understandable detail explained."
8041,"While the overview of the content seemed very reasonable both in scope and pacing, the lack of swirl exercises meant that the final project for the course was a bit jostling. Overall, I think this course still needs some development in the way of exercises to familiarize the student with the practical exercises associated with machine learning."
8042,"mentorship was great, but the video lectures were almost useless."
8043,Great course! The hands-on approach make it very useful for one to start doing some very interesting analysis in real life! Thanks a lot! You guys could only make some efforts in updating some classes and packages used in quizzes. But the rest was great!
8044,I like initial courses like Exploratory Data Analysis but later on it got harder to follow the lectures. A lot of topics were just rushed through and little effort was made to make them engaging or interesting. 
8045,"Really enlightening! It has short videos that fully explicate and explain the concepts and also give you code you can use! The code actually works! I would prefer that the instructor get a proper microphone so his voice sounds not so harsh, but this can be forgiven, because the content really is awesome!You can also download all the lectures (and there are transcripts, too), which is great for later reference. Try it - you will like it!"
8046,"In my opinion, the best course of the entire Data Science Specialization"
8047,Great course
8048,The videos are really tutorials on R functions for machine learning and data wrangling. A good substitute for Machine Learning by Andrew Ng in terms of managing data sets and exploratory analysis.
8049,PML is a deep subject and this course is an excellent foundation for further studies. Prof Leek has taught brilliantly on the basic concepts of PML given the short time of 4 weeks. You need college level statistics to fully appreciate the theories of the PML's lectures. 
8050,Nice
8051,"One of the best courses in the Data Science Specialization,"
8052,Superfluous but the existence of the package caret covers the gap of other libraries like skilearn of python
8053,"By using the caret package, this course took a very pragmatic approach towards machine learning. It demonstrated how to perform all the essential tasks in making the machine (algorithm) learn from data. In my case, this course required a dedicated time commitment for successful completion. In addition to course lectures, i used the 'Machine Learning with R' book to fill my knowledge gaps. Overall i feels that this course helped me in my journey of gaining a better understanding of this subject."
8054,First 3 weeks are manageable and the final project is great! I had a lot of fun :)
8055,very clear explanation
8056,"This course is rather bad, not well rehearsed and hastily delivered. Especially in comparison with other, in-depth course of this Specialization. The course is more of a 'caret' package review then actual Machine Learning. I learned how to use the "
8057,Top 3 course of this specialization.
8058,not what I expected for a machine learning course
8059,"excellent course. Be prepared to learn a lot if you work hard and don't give up if you think it is hard, just continue thinking, and interact with other students and tutors + Google and Stackoverflow!"
8060,Very good overview and straightforward explanations of the different methodologies of ML. Nice tips on how to do ML with R.
8061,It was like opening up a door to a whole new world. I have discovered new tools that I will thoroughly enjoy to use for the exploration of data and for predictions. Thanks Team Coursera !
8062,"Excellent and useful course. Some of the materials covered in Week 4 should be distributed to earlier week(s). The current Week 4 video coverage, quizzes, and the course project on accelerometer data is too much for the week, esp. if the student has lookup and review some key concepts from the resource links in the video slides. Video lectures are informative and easy to follow, although somewhat rushed in Week 4. "
8063,"Excellent course, very practical !I am very curious about the maths so I will add some specialized certifications"
8064,briefly summarised the machine learning algorithms. Good place to start!
8065,"Enlightening! Bring together all previous courses, feel now i am ready to try solving some real life Data Science problems. Great course. Thank you JHU team"
8066,The best
8067,Materials in class are not suficient to understand the subject. There is missing swirl excercises and other hands on practical work. In Data Science specialization this one is the one with most space for improvement. Keep the good work. BR
8068,Too different for beginners but not deep enough for ones already know R.
8069,Excellent course. I feel like i know so much already even though we scratched the tip of the iceberg. Will definitely enroll in more advanced courses. 
8070,The quiz should be constructed in a way that depends less on the version of the libraries used. The rest of course was excellent.
8071,"Awesome course. Jeff Leek does a truly amazing job at explaining very complicated concepts thoroughly and quickly. I'm surprised we went through as much material as we did. Out of the 9, this is one my favorites."
8072,"As the title states, very practical way to show you how this is done in R. Most of them are lines of codes and some explanation. There are tons of details behind that and remains un-explained. As other courses in the specialization, students need to do a lot of self-study to further understand machine learning. But at least, learned a lot. "
8073,My name is Jose Antonio. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11) I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications. The course was excellent and the classes well taught by the Teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Teachers.
8074,"The topic is too big, for one course from my point of view."
8075,"No es un curso en el que se aprenda demasiado.Parece demasiado avanzado en el uso de caret y en vez de ense??ar, parece ser que todo debe ser aprendido con anterioridad.Todo el material adicional que se necesita en el curso, es en general contenido externo."
8076,"good course, but one who is serious about data science should view this course as a starting point since machine learning is a semester long course so I'd recommend follow up with machine learning course taught from Andrew Ng out of Stanford"
8077,"The best course of the specialization along with the statistical inference one - the final assignment is very fun to do, pretty much like a Kaggle competition."
8078,Beautiful insight into ML
8079,"Great intro to machine learning. Several algorithms with some ideas on sampling and pre-processing techniques are covered. Adding a textbook as done with some of the other data science classes would help, but other resources are referenced."
8080,Awesome
8081,Great course. Only missing piece is the working information / maths behind the models. But as the name suggests it teaches practical approach towards machine learning.
8082,"It very well done, good pace, and gives you real and concrete elements and examples to build a fully functional machine learning algorithm! i recommend this course"
8083,"Although again very interesting, I found the lack of additional materials such as practical exercises, swirls and a book reduced the depth of the course knowledge for me. Maybe we have been spoiled by the previous courses :-)"
8084,"Lectures were not very detailed. Quizzes were good and challenging, but too many times the results didn't match the answers even when the random seed was set rightFinal project should have been more challenging with more models to build and compare"
8085,Good content as an introduction to Machine learning!
8086,"Nice introduction to machine learning in R. It is rather basic level, so it not for people that already know some basics related to regression and classification."
8087,Wonderful!
8088,"Gosh I hated hated hated this course. Nothing to learn here. You will just be given lots of names with no explanation whatsoever.I often felt really angry at the teacher because of the way he would introduce entire prediction models without explaining anything about them. Also, I really didn't like the fact that the course is centered on caret, a shortcut package to do stuff fast. Before doing things fast I need to know what I am doing! Finally, the quizzes and assignments are completely disconnected from the courses.The worst course I have ever taken on coursera."
8089,It's a great course but I hope you add a few things. The course about the machine learning algorithm is so basic. Please get deep into the machine learning algorithm. Then it would become the perfect course.
8090,Good enough to open up mind of researcher
8091,"This is a part of the data specialization; from afar, I would not be interested in Machine Learning because of this course. I will seek other methods to learn."
8092,"Exercises could be more complete, and some are outdated for latest R, giving slightly different results."
8093,Fair but assignments are not very well explained
8094,Nice Course for every New candidate 
8095,One of my favorites in the series! What I have been waiting for building up the prerequisite knowledge. Enjoy the instructor!
8096,Excellent course for beginner.
8097,"Was pretty good, but quite short and some assignments did not align as well with the lecture material as they could have."
8098,Lectures are too complicated. I understand that material is not easy and one should do a lot of research and reading to understand the essence of the taught algorithms but the lecturer is also not very helpful and assignments are everywhere on the internet which nobody needs to get tired of thinking a little to do the homework as their product.
8099,Unexpectedly challenging and insightful.
8100,Quizzes are useful exercises but need to do a lot of self studying. 
8101,"Rather basic, nevertheless a good introduction to the topic of machine learning with R. Mostly concentrated on applications of the R caret package. "
8102,"Fun course, also practical and useful"
8103,"great!!! In this lecture, I learn how to write R code to analyze data with Machine learning methods."
8104,"Nice course, Gives a god insight on what can me done with R and Predictions"
8105, Excellent introductory course to Machine Learning. Very informative materials. Prof. Leek is a great teacher. 
8106,Excelente curso. ??timo conhecimento dos instrutores.
8107,The machine learning course every Data Scientist should do.
8108,"Great course, very demanding, but it could use more reading material, ebooks instead of links on video. "
8109,"Unlike the rest of the modules in this specialisation, this one was well taught, a good blend of theory and practice and well paced.There were still a few issues with wording in quizzes (and some where there seemed to be two identical answers to one question, where one would be considered right and the other wrong - purely chance). In addition, the lack of consistency in how to submit assignments across the specialisation is frustrating, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a way to show how to use github or something like that, but it shouldn't be the case."
8110,needs more case studies and examples
8111,"It's very cookbook driven - it's not a deep dive into the topics. This can be dangerous: a little knowledge and all that. However references for more are provided. If you can imitate the coding examples, you should be OK for the assignments. Fair warning: the quizzes are hard to replicate unless you set up your environment to mirror exactly the version of the packages used in the course. "
8112,"Very enjoyable and generally quite understandable introduction to machine learnings with hands-on approach through the course project. It was a bit too fast-paced and generic for my liking, but many options were offered and highlighted for finding additional learning documents and courses to be able to deepen the knowledge acquired in this course."
8113,Great topic with a great instructor. Only wish the program was a little longer to spend some more time on some of the models.
8114,A good introduction to machine learning.
8115,"I learned a lot in this class. There are slight gaps from the depth of material covered in the lectures to the quizzes and assignment. If you're good at researching online, you'll be fine."
8116,"It's hard as hell, and very good."
8117,Just the right level of detail
8118,"Good course for learning the basics of the caret package. However, it is not a good course for learning machine learning."
8119,"too general no depth, not recommended for science or engineering degree holders"
8120,Awesome course giving a practical experience of a Data Scientist.Perfect place to get your hands dirty! :)
8121,Great primer for machine learning with ample additional resources for those who are interested. I feel this course gave me a solid basis to delve deeper into the topic. 
8122, To be honest I don't think this is worth the money. 
8123,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material. 
8124,"Very good content for beginner, lot of learning in machine learning special caret package in R. "
8125,great course
8126,Extremely useful class! Jeff also has many excellent suggestions for resources that will teach you even more about machine learning.
8127,introduces lot of machine learning techniques which are used by practitioners !
8128,This course allows you to implement practical solutions using machine learning algorithms without having to know the mechanisms behind the calculations in detail. Unfortunately questions in the discussion forum were quite rare and many questions were not resolved during this course.
8129,A very good course.
8130,"Great course, very high paced with a lot of information. would have been great to add two more weeks and another project to use more machine learning"
8131,Fantastic class!
8132,In my opinion this course is highly technical and demanding in nature compared with the others. The learning experience is good and coursera.org has given a opportunity for customization ! thank you Coursera 
8133,Great course. I really enjoyed working on the prediction project at the end.
8134,"Good material, presented in an organized fashion. I was able to apply what I learned immediately in a work setting."
8135,Title says everything. Practically and basically no theory explained. Good course though.
8136,"The course is really great, however it should last a little longer, 4 weeks is hard to accomplish"
8137,Nice learning course
8138, Awesome Course !! 
8139,"useful, no nonsense, recommend "
8140,Very informative course.
8141,too easy
8142,One of the most valuable courses in the specialization!
8143,good and useful!
8144,"As as standalone course on machine learning, it's probably best to take Andrew Ng's class on Coursera. This course mostly teaches the basic usage of the caret package. It is too short to cover more fundamental topics in machine learning, like how to choose an algorithm based on the problem and the data.I took this class just because I was engaged in the Data Science specialization. I wanted to clear the Capstone project and get the Data Science specialization certificate."
8145,"I saw two main issues with this course: 1) dated lecture videos, oftentimes with R code that can't be replicated using up-to-date packages, and 2) lack of thoughtful design: example after example after example after example doesn't really teach you anything. "
8146,Felt difficult in understanding the overall course in short duration . 1 month is not enough for this course. I request the authors to make the course much more simpler
8147, Noiiice! 
8148,"I enjoyed a lot this module, I'll use at my daily work some of the features I learned"
8149,Excellent introduction to machine learning. I feel that I have a good basic foundation to start building upon.
8150,Nice course.
8151,johns hopkins' courses very helped me
8152,In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion (such as regression models and stat. inference). The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms. Also I think it's a bit out of date because there is no references to xgbboost which is now dominating many Kaggle contests
8153,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.
8154,This is a very useful course in Machine Learning that teaches us how to use the R based packages such as CARET for applying machine learning techniques. The course project helps understand how these techniques are applied in real world applications and develop useful insights. 
8155,Course content feels upside down. You'll learn about machine algorithm specifics and caveats before anyone explains what the said algorithm actually hopes to achieve.
8156,Muy buen curso :)
8157,"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book. "
8158,"The lectures were great and engaging. I felt like they went too fast. Jeff says at the beginning that this is just an overview and points to some other resources. As an overview, this class works well. You can expect to learn a bit about what machine learning is and how to to do it using the caret package in R."
8159,"Of all the JHU Data Science specialization courses I've had, this was by far the most enjoyable. I really liked how the class was more in the style of 'here's some techniques, now do whatever you want on the project.' Prior courses are, and understandably so, more constrained in the assignments. It's not until here that the student really has the tools to be able to flex their analytical muscles, and it pays off. Also, of the three instructors, I am most favorable to Jeff Leek, who teaches this class. He communicates much clearer than Roger Peng or Brian Caffo. I find I learn more from his content than the others. Lastly, I will say that this class doesn't hold a torch to University of Washington's Machine Learning specialization. That's expected since this is one class and that's a whole series of classes. If you're hungry for more after this one, I highly recommend UWash's Machine Learning specialization."
8160,I really enjoyed this course. The material was concise and allows me to get up and running with ML. 
8161,Good overview of available techniques and the Caret package. Will get you started in machine learning.
8162,"The quizes do not match a 100% with the lecture videos. There are some weird questions. My algorithms' outputs deviate from answers some times, which is due to different software versions. Quizes are not very educating this time. Courses by Brian Caffo were much better."
8163,"Hands-on training, practical introduction to machine learning using R!"
8164,I like the organisation of the course. The first video is so informative yet so simple. Great resources have been listed in it and so subtly. Also I saw the organization of folders and lecture notes and everything in Github repo for this course. It s awesome. I keep stuff like that.. well numbered and everything. I really appreciate it as it makes life of a student lot easier. Thanks.
8165,"Material is very high level. No ppt's are given, so all links presented in the video's cannot be viewed.Quizzes are based upon old packages, so incorrect answers are provided.No replies at discussion board from TAs or instructors."
8166,Principle and practices. Good coverage on topics to get you started! 
8167,"Nice, other courses will go more in depth though."
8168,"With this course, you can develop an important skill for the final steps of a data science project."
8169,Need to get more in-depth
8170,"Great Course, will be nice to have more projects to see how it goes with different data"
8171,"I liked the course and found it informative, but wish there were more stuff on unsupervised learning neural network algorithms (SOMs). Learning about most used algos are great, but would also like to know other machine learning algos that are used concurrently."
8172,"Useful course that is very practical in teaching tools in R that enable Machine learning. This course is, however, not suitable for people who want to learn theoretical machine learning. For that, learners will find Machine Learning by Andrew Ng a better alternative. However, if you're interested in machine learning packages in R and how to implement them, this course achieves that purpose for you."
8173,Very practical and goal-oriented
8174,"I want to learn ML in R so I go straight to this course without taking any other course in this specialization, and it doesn't disappoint me. Thanks for a great course!"
8175,Really Well Structured Course!!
8176,Very informative
8177,"Good introduction to machine learning, might suffer a bit from trying to cover too much ground in such a short time."
8178,The mathematics in this course are at a high level (similar to Statistical Inference) - and are presented at a pace that is challenging without significant background in the field. There is little guidance presented on the methods required. It is recommended that students source out plenty of support material (intro to statistical inference and similar).
8179,High level and brief overview but found it informative introduction into machine learning with R. The final project is fun and interesting.
8180,"Cannot take the exam, I have to pay... wtf... I will probably pay at the end, but I want to take the class first. Without certificate I cannot prove I took the course."
8181,Love it. 
8182,"Absolutely useless random un-explained list of facts and advices that is thrown to a learner without any attempt to give a systematic approach. Pure waste of time and effort. Can only be suitable to those, who already know the subject well and can use some additional facts that are randomly presented in this course."
8183,Very practical tools and also very encouraging!! 
8184,The instructions for the final project were very unclear and even though I submitted all assignments well before their respective deadlines and reviewed the required number of projects my work was not processed for a grade thereby delaying my specialization completion.
8185,Compared to previous two courses in specialization this one is far worse - it is more of excursion into used methods than actual learning using any of mentioned methods in enough detail to be able to do meaningful analyses.
8186,"Some of the terms used here vary from the terms used in the industry. For example recall, precision etc. Overall this is a very good course with provides basics of machine learning. "
8187,"Pretty good overview of how to build some types of machine learning models through the caret library in R, but not much in terms of the theoretical underpinnings or why one method is better than the other or where it is most suitable."
8188,"This was a very good introduction to machine learning and how to use machine learning packages in R. It would have been better if the class had been longer than four weeks, but I learned a lot for the length of the course."
8189,Fast paced and little focused on the algorithms but quite useful overall.
8190,Excellent course with great didactic. Congratulations!
8191,Great introduction with a broad set of tools and plenty of resources for more in depth study. 
8192,"If you have taken Andrew Ng's machine learning class, it's not necessary to take this one."
8193,Great introduction to the subject with good classification examples using R.
8194,Thank you son much!!!! I really like the course. It help me in my job =)
8195,Really good class. I think there were some small issues with the class project. Like all real world problems it was not entirely well specified and the data was a bit odd to use for a prediction exercise because it was time series data.
8196,A good course where you can learn how ML algorithms work practically. 
8197,"Made many things clear. Perhaps, the best class in the series."
8198,"A great Course, my favorite into the Data Science Specialization"
8199,Enjoyed without reservation
8200,This is by far the most enlightening class in the whole specialization. I really got a good handle about how to build a predictive model and apply it to real datasets. 
8201,Very good course. I am very knew to this topic but am sure will find a lot of application in my speciality - geophysics
8202,"Project description versus requirements were terrible, not sure if the new Coursera format played a role in the issues or not. Quite a few of the homework items require guessing as the answers don't align to the results of the latest tools they have you use. If the first class or three in the series was like this I wouldn't have taken the courses. "
8203,This is too high level for a machine learning course. You don't exactly learn a lot about the techniques just how to use them and name them out if you're having a conversation with a person. My least favorite course in the series
8204,"The course gives a clear explanation of why machine learning, with a goal of prediction, is different from regression. The use of the caret package in R is emphasized. Caret provides a uniform interface to many different machine learning algorithms, leaving no excuse for practitioners not to test a variety of approaches to confirm the robustness of their conclusions."
8205,"Had big expectations for this one... really one of the ones to look forward to after working through the beginning of the specialization, but for some reason, it seemed any prof or even TA interaction was absent this time around like in none of the other specialization coursed to date. Bugs in the new interface and quizzes weren't really addressed. Couldn't even get an official response about the apparent removal of Distinction-level now (which I'd been working to get in all specialization courses and now seems no longer an option). Still interesting content. As a free course, it's still really valuable. As one of the people that paid for this and all others in this specialization, this is the one I felt didn't return as much value to justify the payment with no official course staff seeming to be involved this round."
8206,incomplete and not clear. extremely disappointed.
8207,the lack of assisted practices made it harder to digest the contents and methodologies.strongly suggest to develop some practice problems with explanations.
8208,"Poor compared with some of the others on this specialisation. The lectures are too fast and high level, with no allowance given for people who are unfamiliar with this area and attempting to learn it. "
8209,"Wish to have more systematic structure, detail information and hands-on exercises."
8210,"I'm somewhat disappointed. I attend almost all other courses in this specialization (except of data product) and this one is, on my opinion, the weakest one. A lot of links to useful information though. This is more reference guide rather than a real training course. I can say even more, initially I start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one. For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better. In lectures on some concepts (like regularization) I'm pretty sure I would not understand anything if I had not been familiar with the subject before.. "
8211,"Class materials and videos are confusing and do not go into enough detail. Assignments require a lot of search of extra information outside course materials. Also, the length that is needed to complete the assignments vary widely week to week."
8212,"Great practical whirlwind tour. Light on theory, however, but it's a good entry point to the field. Thumbs up!"
8213,"Too much surface, not enough depth. "
8214,First and foremost I'm so thankful for the exposure to so much material in such a condensed schedule. Very good class. Even though I had to muscle my way through it.I think the class could be improved with one additional discussion thread for the project.A guide similar to the ones created for Inferential Statistics and Regression would also have been very helpful. I benefited immensely from reading parts of the book An Introduction to Statistical Learning while taking this course.
8215,"Does not give much intuition around the subject. I found the lectures a bit uninspiring. Lots of powerpoint (just text, no images or visuals really) and the lecturer just underlined the words he was talking about as he read the powerpoint out. I found the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning course gave a much better intuition and understanding of this subject. We also had slides on how to split data into a training and testing set on pretty much EVERY lecture - what a waste of time!"
8216,Great course. Really educational and informative. Well taught too!
8217,more needs to be taught in class. what is taught is not sufficient for quizzes. 
8218,Very good!
8219,"lecture can be really unclear sometimes because lecturer breezes through the actual implementation of training/predicting: use x, y, and z [underlines some stuff on screen] and you're doneAlso lots of mistakes/typos in lecture and quizzes"
8220,"I believe this course is critical and much needed given where the Industry is heading. Prof Leek, has tried his best to explain the concepts in a lucid manner, however the complexity of the content, may challenge most students. A few more examples with R code would have been helpful as translating problem statement to R code may not be intuitive.I would highly recommend that students should plan to study some advance statistics before attempting this course. Having said that, i think this is a wonderful starter course to get a glimpse of what Machine Learning is all about. "
8221,Really good overview of machine learning techniques and model evaluation.
8222,"Thank you for inviting me to be a beta tester for Practical Machine Learning. I completed this course at the beginning of October of this year. When I was asked to be a beta tester I thought that I would be presented with new materials. However, the only thing that has changed is the look and layout of the Coursera web pages. The video lectures, quizzes, and assignment are the same as they have been for quite some time. Here are some specific comments:1. The video lectures: To me, these are clear and easy to follow. However, like those in the other courses in the Data Science Specialization, this course covers a wide range of subjects but tends not to have much depth. When I compare this and other courses in the specialization to other moocs that I have taken including Machine Learning with Andrew Ng and the Stanford Online EdX Course Statistical Learning with Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani, the somewhat cursory treatment of the topics in the Data Science Specialization becomes more noticeable. Perhaps in the interest of truth in advertising this course should be called A Brief Introduction to Practical Machine Learning. In the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I have an undergraduate degree in economics and an MS and PhD in psychology with a quantitative bent. I have had lots of statistics courses, especially those related to ANOVA, MANOVA, nonparametric statistics, correlation and regression methods, and structural equation modeling. The latter is important in psychology because researchers in this field like to measure latent variables. I had been an analyst using SPSS for several decades and the courses in this specialization helped me to migrate to R. Also, there have been may new developments that have become more accessible through R packages (like the fancier tree methods) that were not available when I completed my PhD. Thus these courses (and others such as the ones by Ng and Hastie and Tibshirani) have helped me to keep abreast of these developments. So they are good for me, but I wonder to what degree do the courses in the Data Science Specialization actually make a person a data scientist?2. The quizzes: I think these items are good practice and are at a reasonable level of difficulty. However, these items are the same ones that you have been giving for quite some time, with perhaps a few new ones added. A little googling will lead you to the answers to these quizzes posted online. I recommend that you put a little time and effort into writing all new items. 3. The final project: Again, this project is good practice and seems to be at a reasonable level of difficulty. And again, this is the same project that appears to have been given at the end of numerous iterations of this course. And again, numerous write-ups for this project can be found online. And again, I would recommend that you put a little time and effort into finding a new data set for people to analyze. This would help minimize some of the rampant cheating that I found in this and in other classes in the specialization.On the subject of cheating, when I was doing the peer grading for the courses in the Specialization, I would enter the code of the students that I was grading into the Google search box and all too often I found links to submissions for the project by students who had taken earlier sessions of the class. That is, students were copying these earlier submissions by other students and submitting them as their own. And I don't mean that they were similar: students were copying other people's work line by line, character by character. I found that to be quite irritating and I always reported it to Coursera. Of course, if the instructors would change their assignments once I a while, then this sort of copying would be impossible. As it is, it appears that the good professors put a lot of time and effort into creating what are indeed a worthwhile set of classes. However, after they created the classes, they seem to have pushed the autopilot button and gone off to do their day jobs. I would suggest that re-engaging with these courses and reading some of the comments that other students have made would be helpful. Overall, I appreciate the courses in the Data Science Specialization and specifically this course. I know that these class materials took considerable time and efforts to create. I wish the instructors continued success with these classes."
8223,A good introductory course for people who has an interest in knowing the principles of machine learning and want to make a step forward. Sufficient details covered throughout the course and additional resources were provided which are very useful. Quizzes were well designed with minor improvements in the accidental mismatch of the answers due to package version issues. Overall the study experience was enjoyable and would definitely recommend to someone who wants to start knowing data science.
8224,"Feels like everything is solved using a caret package, while the back-end theory is only slightly touched. By using a single line command solver, student may lack the foundation for harder problems in the real world."
8225,loved it - fascinating subject and more detail than you could possibly want from the course instructors. Friendly community in the forum too.
8226,"By far the laziest course set up in the track. It's an interesting topic, but without independent study I would have learned almost nothing due to the lack of any practicals in this Practical Machine Learning. A really disappointing course that fails to be worth more than just a couple hours of youtube."
8227,Fantastic Class!
8228,I enjoyed detailed information and was very straight forward to understand.
8229,Very fine course in machine learning where the focus is more on the use of ML rather on the theory behind it i.e. the course title fits its contents.
8230,"This course really demystified machine learning, and provided practical steps and guidance on how to create predictive models. While I do wish there were more resources on how to tune models and investigate specific model parameters, I understand that there just wasn't enough time. I couldn't imagine a better course for a solid foundation in this skill."
8231,Good
8232,Good in introducing caret package and getting some experience in running algorithms. Was expecting more in-depth discussion about the methods though.
8233,Interesting the final assignment. 
8234,"I learned so much in such a short period of time. Challenging, very hands on, great theoretical foundations! "
8235,This was definitely a challenging course. I learned a lot about building and testing prediction algorithms. The course also helped me overcome the feeling of intimidation by providing excellent examples and a hands-on final assignment.
8236,Great as an introduction for someone with no practical experience. Lectures are too theoretical and lack some examples to translates the theory into practice
8237,Good
8238,ok
8239,Very useful course. Great tutors. 
8240,"First I want to thank very much the instructor in the online forum. He helped me a lot at the end of the course and his tutorials for gh-pages are excellent. He was also very fast in responding. Thank you. The course did ultimately not really gave me what I was looking for. Maybe too may different facts and not enough depth. I am not sure that I can confidently say that I can build a ML model now. Technically I can, but the deeper understanding is missing. For example: When would I use which method (for example rf versus naive base), the last exercise about cross validation was not fully clear. Using the caret package is too high level for a learner. It would be better to see some more step by step examples. It was not clear to me what the expected error calculation in the last exercise was really looking at. Maybe what is missing a swirl exercises, not using caret. and then explaining how caret can simplify it. We also learned how to create a predictive model, but did not go into how the model gets updated and gets retrained, an important aspect of ML. i also do not see unsupervised learning to be covered. "
8241,good course
8242,Best course of the programme. Simple and explained well.
8243,"This is such a cornerstone topic to the Data Science Specialization that I think it deserves a better designed and more polished curriculum. The subject is so extensive that it might be worthy to split the contents in two courses. Finally, I would like to suggest the authors of the course modeling the curriculum following the amazing treatment of the subject found in Introduction to Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshiriani et. al. "
8244,Jeff Leek is a great professor .The delivery of the course material is very clear and covers a lot of predictive methods by using mainly R's caret package. Recommended for sure. 
8245,"This course was a big let-down compared to other courses in the specialization. It doesn't seem like a lot of effort went into course planning and creation. Much of the content is unclear and there is little depth. course textbook, and some swirl exercises would have helped."
8246,Excelente curso!
8247,Very good summary of strengths/weaknesses of various machine learning algorithms. This lecturer's style and production quality is much higher than in the previous two courses in the specialization series.
8248,"Good course on the whole, learned a lot and enjoyed it, but it would need to be updated and corrected (certain bits of code don't work as they did when the course was produced, which can be pretty confusing). Would be nice also to add some more content at the end of the course : the lecture about unsupervised prediction felt rushed, and a proper conclusion opening up to the rest of the field would be useful. Anyway thanks again for this wonderful learning opportunity, keep it up ! Cheers"
8249,This course is a good introduction to machine learning algorithms with R
8250,"very good, but if it has swirl practice like th other courses it would be perfect."
8251,"So why four stars vs five stars, of all the Data Science Certification courses that I have taken: i) some of the examples and quiz challenges don't work as they should, ii) Machine Learning is rapidly changing area - should be updated to reflect this and perhaps a high level taste of Deep Learning, iii) posting the Final Project is overly complicated relative to methods of the other courses - this should be cleaned up - still not clear how point to a github repo link and also have a rendered html page working from that same link - requires two links to present materials and must use default names like index vs. a project name."
8252,excellent!
8253,Very useful course to develop level knowledge in machine learning. 
8254,Very good course. The content can be enriched with some more technical details behind the various techniques. There needs to be 1 more course on Practical Machine Learning in the specialization as 1 course is far too less for such a vast topic.
8255,"Nice, clear and concise."
8256,Instructor rushes the course and does not explain much in the same level of details as respective quiz requires
8257,"Issues of every stage of the construction of learning machine model, as well as issues with several different machine learning methods are well and in fine yet very understandable detail explained."
8258,"mentorship was great, but the video lectures were almost useless."
8259,Great course! The hands-on approach make it very useful for one to start doing some very interesting analysis in real life! Thanks a lot! You guys could only make some efforts in updating some classes and packages used in quizzes. But the rest was great!
8260,Great course
8261,PML is a deep subject and this course is an excellent foundation for further studies. Prof Leek has taught brilliantly on the basic concepts of PML given the short time of 4 weeks. You need college level statistics to fully appreciate the theories of the PML's lectures. 
8262,"One of the best courses in the Data Science Specialization,"
8263,Superfluous but the existence of the package caret covers the gap of other libraries like skilearn of python
8264,"By using the caret package, this course took a very pragmatic approach towards machine learning. It demonstrated how to perform all the essential tasks in making the machine (algorithm) learn from data. In my case, this course required a dedicated time commitment for successful completion. In addition to course lectures, i used the 'Machine Learning with R' book to fill my knowledge gaps. Overall i feels that this course helped me in my journey of gaining a better understanding of this subject."
8265,First 3 weeks are manageable and the final project is great! I had a lot of fun :)
8266,very clear explanation
8267,"excellent course. Be prepared to learn a lot if you work hard and don't give up if you think it is hard, just continue thinking, and interact with other students and tutors + Google and Stackoverflow!"
8268,It was like opening up a door to a whole new world. I have discovered new tools that I will thoroughly enjoy to use for the exploration of data and for predictions. Thanks Team Coursera !
8269,"Excellent and useful course. Some of the materials covered in Week 4 should be distributed to earlier week(s). The current Week 4 video coverage, quizzes, and the course project on accelerometer data is too much for the week, esp. if the student has lookup and review some key concepts from the resource links in the video slides. Video lectures are informative and easy to follow, although somewhat rushed in Week 4. "
8270,"Excellent course, very practical !I am very curious about the maths so I will add some specialized certifications"
8271,briefly summarised the machine learning algorithms. Good place to start!
8272,"Enlightening! Bring together all previous courses, feel now i am ready to try solving some real life Data Science problems. Great course. Thank you JHU team"
8273,The best
8274,Materials in class are not suficient to understand the subject. There is missing swirl excercises and other hands on practical work. In Data Science specialization this one is the one with most space for improvement. Keep the good work. BR
8275,Too different for beginners but not deep enough for ones already know R.
8276,Excellent course. I feel like i know so much already even though we scratched the tip of the iceberg. Will definitely enroll in more advanced courses. 
8277,The quiz should be constructed in a way that depends less on the version of the libraries used. The rest of course was excellent.
8278,"Awesome course. Jeff Leek does a truly amazing job at explaining very complicated concepts thoroughly and quickly. I'm surprised we went through as much material as we did. Out of the 9, this is one my favorites."
8279,"As the title states, very practical way to show you how this is done in R. Most of them are lines of codes and some explanation. There are tons of details behind that and remains un-explained. As other courses in the specialization, students need to do a lot of self-study to further understand machine learning. But at least, learned a lot. "
8280,My name is Jose Antonio. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11) I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications. The course was excellent and the classes well taught by the Teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Teachers.
8281,"The topic is too big, for one course from my point of view."
8282,"good course, but one who is serious about data science should view this course as a starting point since machine learning is a semester long course so I'd recommend follow up with machine learning course taught from Andrew Ng out of Stanford"
8283,"The best course of the specialization along with the statistical inference one - the final assignment is very fun to do, pretty much like a Kaggle competition."
8284,"Great intro to machine learning. Several algorithms with some ideas on sampling and pre-processing techniques are covered. Adding a textbook as done with some of the other data science classes would help, but other resources are referenced."
8285,Awesome
8286,Great course. Only missing piece is the working information / maths behind the models. But as the name suggests it teaches practical approach towards machine learning.
8287,"It very well done, good pace, and gives you real and concrete elements and examples to build a fully functional machine learning algorithm! i recommend this course"
8288,"Although again very interesting, I found the lack of additional materials such as practical exercises, swirls and a book reduced the depth of the course knowledge for me. Maybe we have been spoiled by the previous courses :-)"
8289,"Lectures were not very detailed. Quizzes were good and challenging, but too many times the results didn't match the answers even when the random seed was set rightFinal project should have been more challenging with more models to build and compare"
8290,Good content as an introduction to Machine learning!
8291,"Nice introduction to machine learning in R. It is rather basic level, so it not for people that already know some basics related to regression and classification."
8292,Wonderful!
8293,"Gosh I hated hated hated this course. Nothing to learn here. You will just be given lots of names with no explanation whatsoever.I often felt really angry at the teacher because of the way he would introduce entire prediction models without explaining anything about them. Also, I really didn't like the fact that the course is centered on caret, a shortcut package to do stuff fast. Before doing things fast I need to know what I am doing! Finally, the quizzes and assignments are completely disconnected from the courses.The worst course I have ever taken on coursera."
8294,It's a great course but I hope you add a few things. The course about the machine learning algorithm is so basic. Please get deep into the machine learning algorithm. Then it would become the perfect course.
8295,"Exercises could be more complete, and some are outdated for latest R, giving slightly different results."
8296,Fair but assignments are not very well explained
8297,One of my favorites in the series! What I have been waiting for building up the prerequisite knowledge. Enjoy the instructor!
8298,Excellent course for beginner.
8299,"Was pretty good, but quite short and some assignments did not align as well with the lecture material as they could have."
8300,Lectures are too complicated. I understand that material is not easy and one should do a lot of research and reading to understand the essence of the taught algorithms but the lecturer is also not very helpful and assignments are everywhere on the internet which nobody needs to get tired of thinking a little to do the homework as their product.
8301,Unexpectedly challenging and insightful.
8302,"Rather basic, nevertheless a good introduction to the topic of machine learning with R. Mostly concentrated on applications of the R caret package. "
8303,"Fun course, also practical and useful"
8304,"Nice course, Gives a god insight on what can me done with R and Predictions"
8305, Excellent introductory course to Machine Learning. Very informative materials. Prof. Leek is a great teacher. 
8306,The machine learning course every Data Scientist should do.
8307,"Great course, very demanding, but it could use more reading material, ebooks instead of links on video. "
8308,"It's very cookbook driven - it's not a deep dive into the topics. This can be dangerous: a little knowledge and all that. However references for more are provided. If you can imitate the coding examples, you should be OK for the assignments. Fair warning: the quizzes are hard to replicate unless you set up your environment to mirror exactly the version of the packages used in the course. "
8309,"Very enjoyable and generally quite understandable introduction to machine learnings with hands-on approach through the course project. It was a bit too fast-paced and generic for my liking, but many options were offered and highlighted for finding additional learning documents and courses to be able to deepen the knowledge acquired in this course."
8310,Great topic with a great instructor. Only wish the program was a little longer to spend some more time on some of the models.
8311,"I learned a lot in this class. There are slight gaps from the depth of material covered in the lectures to the quizzes and assignment. If you're good at researching online, you'll be fine."
8312,Just the right level of detail
8313,"Good course for learning the basics of the caret package. However, it is not a good course for learning machine learning."
8314,Awesome course giving a practical experience of a Data Scientist.Perfect place to get your hands dirty! :)
8315, To be honest I don't think this is worth the money. 
8316,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material. 
8317,Extremely useful class! Jeff also has many excellent suggestions for resources that will teach you even more about machine learning.
8318,A very good course.
8319,"Great course, very high paced with a lot of information. would have been great to add two more weeks and another project to use more machine learning"
8320,"Good material, presented in an organized fashion. I was able to apply what I learned immediately in a work setting."
8321,Title says everything. Practically and basically no theory explained. Good course though.
8322,"The course is really great, however it should last a little longer, 4 weeks is hard to accomplish"
8323,Nice learning course
8324, Awesome Course !! 
8325,Very informative course.
8326,One of the most valuable courses in the specialization!
8327,"I enjoyed a lot this module, I'll use at my daily work some of the features I learned"
8328,Excellent introduction to machine learning. I feel that I have a good basic foundation to start building upon.
8329,Nice course.
8330,In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion (such as regression models and stat. inference). The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms. Also I think it's a bit out of date because there is no references to xgbboost which is now dominating many Kaggle contests
8331,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.
8332,This is a very useful course in Machine Learning that teaches us how to use the R based packages such as CARET for applying machine learning techniques. The course project helps understand how these techniques are applied in real world applications and develop useful insights. 
8333,Course content feels upside down. You'll learn about machine algorithm specifics and caveats before anyone explains what the said algorithm actually hopes to achieve.
8334,Muy buen curso :)
8335,"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book. "
8336,"Of all the JHU Data Science specialization courses I've had, this was by far the most enjoyable. I really liked how the class was more in the style of 'here's some techniques, now do whatever you want on the project.' Prior courses are, and understandably so, more constrained in the assignments. It's not until here that the student really has the tools to be able to flex their analytical muscles, and it pays off. Also, of the three instructors, I am most favorable to Jeff Leek, who teaches this class. He communicates much clearer than Roger Peng or Brian Caffo. I find I learn more from his content than the others. Lastly, I will say that this class doesn't hold a torch to University of Washington's Machine Learning specialization. That's expected since this is one class and that's a whole series of classes. If you're hungry for more after this one, I highly recommend UWash's Machine Learning specialization."
8337,Good overview of available techniques and the Caret package. Will get you started in machine learning.
8338,"Nice, other courses will go more in depth though."
8339,"With this course, you can develop an important skill for the final steps of a data science project."
8340,"Great Course, will be nice to have more projects to see how it goes with different data"
8341,"I liked the course and found it informative, but wish there were more stuff on unsupervised learning neural network algorithms (SOMs). Learning about most used algos are great, but would also like to know other machine learning algos that are used concurrently."
8342,Very practical and goal-oriented
8343,"I want to learn ML in R so I go straight to this course without taking any other course in this specialization, and it doesn't disappoint me. Thanks for a great course!"
8344,Really Well Structured Course!!
8345,Very informative
8346,"Good introduction to machine learning, might suffer a bit from trying to cover too much ground in such a short time."
8347,The mathematics in this course are at a high level (similar to Statistical Inference) - and are presented at a pace that is challenging without significant background in the field. There is little guidance presented on the methods required. It is recommended that students source out plenty of support material (intro to statistical inference and similar).
8348,Very practical tools and also very encouraging!! 
8349,"Pretty good overview of how to build some types of machine learning models through the caret library in R, but not much in terms of the theoretical underpinnings or why one method is better than the other or where it is most suitable."
8350,"This was a very good introduction to machine learning and how to use machine learning packages in R. It would have been better if the class had been longer than four weeks, but I learned a lot for the length of the course."
8351,Fast paced and little focused on the algorithms but quite useful overall.
8352,Great introduction with a broad set of tools and plenty of resources for more in depth study. 
8353,Great introduction to the subject with good classification examples using R.
8354,A good course where you can learn how ML algorithms work practically. 
8355,"Made many things clear. Perhaps, the best class in the series."
8356,"A great Course, my favorite into the Data Science Specialization"
8357,This is by far the most enlightening class in the whole specialization. I really got a good handle about how to build a predictive model and apply it to real datasets. 
8358,Very good course. I am very knew to this topic but am sure will find a lot of application in my speciality - geophysics
8359,"Had big expectations for this one... really one of the ones to look forward to after working through the beginning of the specialization, but for some reason, it seemed any prof or even TA interaction was absent this time around like in none of the other specialization coursed to date. Bugs in the new interface and quizzes weren't really addressed. Couldn't even get an official response about the apparent removal of Distinction-level now (which I'd been working to get in all specialization courses and now seems no longer an option). Still interesting content. As a free course, it's still really valuable. As one of the people that paid for this and all others in this specialization, this is the one I felt didn't return as much value to justify the payment with no official course staff seeming to be involved this round."
8360,incomplete and not clear. extremely disappointed.
8361,"Wish to have more systematic structure, detail information and hands-on exercises."
8362,"I'm somewhat disappointed. I attend almost all other courses in this specialization (except of data product) and this one is, on my opinion, the weakest one. A lot of links to useful information though. This is more reference guide rather than a real training course. I can say even more, initially I start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one. For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better. In lectures on some concepts (like regularization) I'm pretty sure I would not understand anything if I had not been familiar with the subject before.. "
8363,"Class materials and videos are confusing and do not go into enough detail. Assignments require a lot of search of extra information outside course materials. Also, the length that is needed to complete the assignments vary widely week to week."
8364,Awesome!
8365,It gave me more confident about Front-End. Highly Recommend
8366,"The course explains HTML, CSS, and Javascript for complete beginners, although even more advanced users can still benefit from the course. The course material is very easy to follow, consists of both theory and hands-on examples. The instructor delivers awesome lectures, very easy to follow and understandable! Definitely recommend it for anyone who either wants to learn these skills or those who might already know them but want to refresh their memory (like myself)."
8367," It is so much clear to understand the lessons,even your english is not good. Thank to all people who gives us their precious time to teach. "
8368,"Well structured course, helped me build my skills."
8369,"Excellent course my friends, teaches the basics of what you need to know to use HTML,CSS,Javascript and then it expands on it just enough so you know whats coming, its a beautifully well crafted course and the starter of a complete program made by Coursera to learn how to be a web developer, i personally recommend this course in its entirety."
8370,Good course!
8371,"Nice course to refresh the basic's, you will defiantly learn something new "
8372,"Very, very good course! Many useful things were explained thoroughly!!! Thank you David Rossiter! Good luck with what you do!"
8373,The professor made it in an easy and clever way!
8374,"What I found interesting in this course was the fact that assignments were hands-on, thus I go to actually put the things I learned into practical use, not just watch and pretend to understand."
8375,It was very helpful to me to know the basic concept of web designing... thank you for so.....
8376,well done!
8377,"Good introduction to web development, however I would update js part. Maybe use es6/esnext and use standard code conventions (like camel case names etc) so that students don't learn bad habits."
8378,"Good basic introduction to HTML, CSS &amp; JS. You can grasp a basics and evolve your knowledge using other resources and later courses in the full stack program. "
8379,"Great course. Short, clear lesson that inform the exercises and practice questions. Learned a lot despite already knowing a fair amount about HTML and CSS. Enjoyed the projects!"
8380,"Love the professor, love the course, splendid job guys!"
8381,excellent course. A best place for beginners!
8382,"The instructor David is really, really a very great teacher! It is definitely worth taking, while I didn't purchased it, but it is worth it. He made every concept as clear as it was possible."
8383,teach from basics to advance
8384,Fantastic course!
8385,"nice teacher ,nice course"
8386,"Clear, and easy to understand. Very compact and focused course. Thank You "

8404,Great course for beginner. Its explain detail on DOM concept with javascript core. HTML and CSS are good too.
8405,Very Good
8406,"Enjoyed the course a lot, definitely worth taking it. There is of course a lot out there to learn about these topics that will not be covered BUT if you are a beginner like myself want to have your coding up and going and ignite your interest, this is the course for you."
8407,Great course for beginners at Javascript!!
8408,very help full

8417,Excellent course 
8418,"Excelent!Grate introduction to Html,Css,and Java script .yes this project is very hard challenging but hard workingis big Success!"
8419,"The actual assignments hold your hand too much for this class. A student could get a lot more out of this time with more challenging and better thought out assignments. An effective introduction, but an ineffectual of creating substantial and useable knowledge."
8420,Excelent!
8421,"Great introduction to html, css, and javascript. The projects were challenging, but achievable with a bit of elbow grease."
8422,Very Good course for beginner
8423,Great Course to jump into web programming!

8441,good
8442,The course was comprehensive
8443,Nice course
8444,VERY GOOD
8445,El curso es muy completo y didactico.
8446,Very Interesting Course; The pedagogic approach is innovative
8447,simply best for beginners!
8448,great course for the beginners.
8449,Some more information regarding the HTML attributes like area controls would have been good. 
8450,Very well structured course.
8451,This was a great class. The professor did a great job breaking down concepts with concrete examples and assignments. 
8452,Very useful
8453,"It was very good, I could have a good understanding about the course."
8454,Best course!!!
8455,It was great! A great start.
8456,It is a very useful course for beginners. I strongly recommend it !
8457,The course is full of fun. I like the interesting assignment and I learned a lot from doing by myself and reviewing other students' work. I also got feedback from my classmates which helped me a lot.
8458,"Un curso muy bueno, muchas gracias!!"
8459,The course content is very backward and needs to be updated though the quiz and project parts were very good and I enjoyed completing the course. 
8460,Javascript course content can be increased
8461,Very helpful and awesome.!!
8462,The great course!
8463,The course is very informative. The topics discussed are precise and the tutor was very nice to help us understand the concepts easily.
8464,Excellent course
8465,This is probably the best thing that I have decided to do in the last 10 years. Coming across Coursera and the offered University courses is a great thing to enhance your abilities for finding new opportunities out there. I'm looking forward to successful completion of the rest of the courses as well. Thank you for the great opportunity again Vancho
8466,"While not very in depth regarding HTML and CSS, this course gives a nice skim over the HTML and CSS aspects. Regarding JavaScript, this course is the best introduction I've done so far. I would definitely recommend this course for anyone looking to fill in gaps in their base knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript"
8467,"I love this course! Firstly, professor's accent is so clear and I can understand 100% what he is talking. Additionally, I like the short video per point - which keeps me concentrate within a few minutes. It is a kind of very efficient instruction design. Last but not least, the assignment design is great, not too hard nor too much. I can practice what I have learnt and what I need to know in doing these assignments. In a word, professor demonstrated fairly high teaching capability and left me a very good impression of HKUST. I would highly recommend this course to my friends who are interested in learning web technologies! "
8468,Nice course! Easy to understand and practice
8469,"Good course and congratulations to Professor David.I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about html, css and js."
8470,"Very progressive and efficient learning. Each week's assessment gives enough challenge to be able to make progress, while being fun and interesting."
8471,"Very nice intro course for learning the basics of web programming, thank you to Dr. Rossiter and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for making this course available to students worldwide."
8472,Awesome Course. Good to go ... 
8473,This course is really good. I enjoyed this course a lot.
8474,A good course for a beginner level.
8475,It is too basic.
8476,"2???????????????????????????,??????????????????????????????,ppt?????????????????????????????????.(&lt;del&gt;???????????????????????????????????????????????????...&lt;/del&gt;)"
8477,"Just got my certificate today, One of the best course out there to start from basic. little bit fast hence have to read lots of resources from other media like W3school.com. other then that its the best course to start with in web development."
8478,It is very old technique of teaching
8479,"Was challenging and Educative, really sad that I could not finish all the courses on this bundle, thanks David Coursera,Rossiter, and Every other person that help put this up"
8480,Excellent course!
8481, The course gave good basic knowledge of html and javascript 
8482,the courses are well structured 
8483,"The course is very instructive but the student should be prepared to do some considerable research on their own as well! The assignments can be challenging for beginners but, if you get through them, you'll have learned a lot!"
8484,i like how the teacher explain all html and css tags and how they work this course is very helpful thanks .
8485,"A very well-structured course. Offers a very good introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Didn't take me a long time to complete, but still came out with a lot of knowledge about the subject matter. Recommended for any beginner. PS: The weekly assignments are really fun to do!"
8486,As a beginner course this is good. Everything is illustrated with examples but most of them are classroom type examples which help in understanding but have limited use in commercial applications. AS a startup course for these subjects this is really good.
8487,super cool
8488,great
8489,Course is pretty good for Learning
8490,"Excellent course and I really enjoyed the learning process I had been guiding through these weeks. This is a great entry level course for people like me who have few knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The professor went through each concepts explicitly. Some concepts in JavaScript can be tricky for students without a CS background, but this course really makes things easier to understand. There are some small challenging in assignments, but it's still a great opportunity to transform all those concepts to my knowledge and experiences. "
8491,Nice Explanations and Assignments... Worth the time and money... :D
8492,Very complete course to learn every single aspect of HTML5.
8493,Good coursework
8494,This course was really fun and you'll learn a lot :) .

8497,good
8498,Very good course. Recommend
8499,"i really liked the course, it was very clear and helped me a lot"
8500,tThis course is extremely good. The videos are all self explanatory and need no extra reference . Even the idea given altogether is enough for a beginner . 
8501,"Excellent course. Great videos, very useful assignments and to the point. Thanks to the instructor for wonderful videos and staff for the support."
8502,its amazing
8503,Good!
8504,The tutorials are good. 
8505,Grate course
8506,"I'm only in the first week,the course content (audio, video, pdf files) are so helping, the course easy to understand and well structured.I really like this course"
8507,"Muy buen curso, estar??a bueno que se den menos ayudas en los videos para los ejercicios, en caso de precisar m??s ayuda el foro es una buena opci??n"
8508,"It was good. The professor teaches well, but I think course went a little bit fast. Also I had some issues with audio. Above all, it was good."
8509,Good to learn
8510,A great course. I've learned a lot from it.
8511,Very in depth and detailed course!
8512,I took the course to update myself on HTML5 and get the fundamentals of JS. I think for people with no development experience can be a little bit confusing as some of the concepts are explained very superficial.
8513,Excellent course. The teacher is very thorough and explains in details.
8514,An awesome package that would be found useful and engaging for those who really want to acquire knowledge and skills in full stack web development. The Prof. has done a really nice job in putting these together.
8515,Nice course. Helped me learn a lot.
8516,Very good! I will continue my lessons!
8517,"Coursera is a good platform to learn new technologies, assignments are useful to learn problem solving skills"
8518,Good for beginners !!!!!!
8519,Very comprehensive and fruitful.
8520,best course ever i could even teach this to anyone else and david roister is my faviourite teacher and honk kong universty of scince and technology in my favourite universty and i am just 10 
8521,"Although not in deep, this course provides the basics for learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS in a confortable way. Teacher David Rossiter is great explaining the basics and also the language is easy to understand even for those not very used to eanglish language."
8522,sooooooo gooood
8523,Excellent course well suited for beginners but raising their level fast
8524,"Excellent course designed , examples are very simple and understandable ."
8525,The professor clearly explains the basis of these technologies.
8526,"Very interesting for beginners. Is very hands on focus, not much theory and is focus on the most used commands, leaving the deep knowledge for other courses."
8527,This course is just Awesome and the way it teaches you is priceless. Must have course .
8528,"I like and enjoy this subjects , and let me think and learn a lot from it ."
8529,"it was a great opportunity learning here, we are grateful to you all for such an amazing work"
8530,"Highly Recommended Course For Learning the Core part of HTML , CSS and JavaScript ."
8531,"I feel this course offers great exposure to the basics of the fundamental web development technologies- HTML, CSS and JS. It sets solid foundation and generates enthusiasm in learner's mind to explore more further."
8532,This course was the best option to get started in the web development
8533,"I would say it was very quick over-viewed and extremely informative course! However, I would recommend not to stop on this and look up for more on HTML, CSS and JS."
8534,Great course!!!
8535,Excellent introductory course into website development.
8536,Great course
8537,"It's a great course to know the basic thing in HTML,CSS and JS"
8538,very bad demonstration

8540,Bad video quality.
8541,I recommend this course 100%
8542,"Very nice crash course in HTML, Javascript and CSS"
8543,Very clear and well organized! Thank you!
8544,I think the course needs more in-depth details. The course contains very good amount of examples that really offer a useful guide for practical javascript.
8545,Very nice course for introduction
8546,I love this course. The advisor explain everything clearly and the knowledge is very helpful.
8547,Excellent course!
8548,"The course is excellently taught by David and I learned a lot. Worth doing as a pre-cursor to any other, longer web design course you might be considering as it gives you the basics. My advice would be to take time with the lectures, download a html text editor and pause frequently to check the code yourself and make sure it works. It moves quickly, but there's a lot to be learned from pausing and trying it yourself. "
8549,"The HTML, CSS and JavaScript course was well structured, challenging and interesting. The professor was excellent and I thank him and all the staff for a great course."
8550,Very good! This course gives a good introduction to the main Web Development technologies.

8592,"Nice course, really dynamic and well explained. Really recommend it. "
8593,good
8594,This course has provided me with all the knowledge of the essential technologies of web developement. Mr. David Rossiter is a good teacher. Thanks again 
8595,"Not really a beginner course. I had to complement this course with other JS open source courses only to realise JS is really huge. Additionally, the course requires prior knowledge about HTML and CSS as well and it does not seem to be up to date with newest language versions such as HTML5 and CSS3"
8596,great teacher
8597,Excellent course!
8598,"Tr??s bon cours pour html, css et surtout javascript"
8599,JS should be more indepth.

8605,To the point. Precise. Concise. I would recommend it to anyone who want's to take a first course in Web Development.
8606,"Excellent Explanations by Prof.David ! :) Nice to be a part of this , thanks :)"
8607,I would have preferred if the tutor always showed some real life example on how to use the learning in creating an online shop for instance.
8608,This is one of the best lectures I have ever had. Thanks so muchI love every part of this course.Easy to understand and well explained materials.
8609,really good for beginners
8610,The instructor is amazing. So organized and well taught. I absolutely love this course.
8611,Excellent course!
8612,Useful for all web developers...
8613,I loved this course! It presents the contents in a very simple way. It teaches the necessary to keep advancing on the second course of the specialization (which I highly recommend).

8620,"Very clear explanations, and good examples. Good introduction to HTML and Javascript."
8621,"Good pace, and just the right level of guidance for some interesting assignments."
8622,I would have liked the course to have more step by step lectures that would allow us to follow the same structure when going through our assignments. Maybe even explain the assignment in the start then apply each lecture to show how each step is done within the assignment. I had to resort to third party sites and found that alot of the assignments have been uploaded online already.
8623,"Really enjoyed the course. The instructor doesn't waste time teaching his philosophy of teaching, and instead uses the time wisely to instruct. Great job!"
8624,This is the best course ever!! So much fun and learning!! 
8625,the course is very good. Good explanations.there should have been more assessments in between the videos for the topic that is taught.too much is covered at once.
8626,This course gave me a nice start. Totally recommend if you're a beginner. Content was not overwhelming and tasks were a real challenge for me
8627,"This online learning programs is more suitable for the beginner to learn the programming because it is very clear, easy to understand, Chinese subtitle, and the student can try to code following the teaching material. However, I feel comfortable to learn the programming lessons."
8628,It's pretty good course. Although I have not completed this course yet.

8632,There should be more week to learn. There should be more data about HTML and exercises to practice. I had lot of fun .Thank You.
8633,"Excellent course with a good pedagogy, I absolutely recommend to take it and continue with the rest of the courses of specialization. You will learn a lot if you are really motivated. And as a bonus, you will have created a personal project at the end of this specialization."
8634,This course very useful for my learning.

8777,nice and simple for beginners 
8778,"the course is great but i have problem with the assignments as they all have to be in parts and i can't get why we only submit last part as if it is right the others is right also, i didn't like the assignments system in this course but the course and the assignments itself were great"
8779,good video 
8780,Course had a good content and the exercises were able to make the use of the elements
8781,One of the best course out there for web developers

8792,That's really a good way to start on web developing major!
8793,Great course!
8794,The course is very interesting for junior -wannabe- web programmers. It uses the main structures of HTML and JavaScript and lets the user exercise through questions and assignments. Best option if someone wants to be a web developer!
8795,I like the pace of the course.
8796,I am loving this course and i think it will help me a lot in developing my responsive dream web application.
8797,"A great class for anyone interested in learning the essentials of html, css, and javascript in relatively short order."
8798,It's awesome! But It is very very general!
8799,Good way to get hands on experience. While it is challenging to get a quesiton answer - as there is a lot of searching on the forums (rather than having 1-1 or life q&amp;a)
8800,Fantastic Course. I feel confident with the exercises and information provided!
8801,pretty well !!!! 
8802,"It seems quite slow pace at the beginning, but I love the fact that there are no assumptions on knowledge and a lot of small details are being explained. These details are very important, specially when you take this course as an advance c++ programmer. Understanding the advantages that Javascript has built-in as a languague is really useful! Thank you!"
8803,Excellent. A very clear and engaging delivery by Prof. Rossiter.
8804,Great Course. The way lectures were delivered is Outstanding.I really learned many things within a month from it. Thanks
8805,"I really enjoy this course and learnt a lot. I was not familiar with HTML, CSS and Javacript but I could follow without any problems. The Professor is excellent, didatic and explain the lessons with clarity. I am very thankful for this learning."
8806,"I afraid to learn JS until take this course. Course has really good presentation and content to understand behaviour between HTML, CSS and JS. I would definitely recommend to take this course if you are interested in web development."
8807,The videos and presentation are fine.The exercises are quite easy and the main problem of the course is that they are review for other students withput any teacher assuring that is right.
8808,"Very nice and the presentations are very clear and understandable, It's a very basic course of web development which is why I think it's a little bit expensive for this level of course. "
8809,Awesome!
8810,excellent course for web developers.Great lecture notes.
8811,Really clear but it's a pity that there is nowhere a free possibility to gain certificates... :(
8812," This course will be very help for me in my masters track. Since I am doing master in this field so I want to study all the topic in more detail. Furthermore, the course is helpful for me in my career development. "
8813,Excellent course. The explanations are very clear and easy to understand. There are very good excercices and you can also learn a lot from the assignments. Assignment 3 is paticularly fun with a lot of interesting logic.
8814,"Very comprehensive, good balance between theory and excercises."
8815,this course is really helpful for beginners. Also I enjoyed the assignments. 
8816,Really good course on HTML5/CSS/JavaScript. Enough resources and practices exercises.
8817,Very good intro class. The exercises were really helpful.
8818,"Fun to follow, light hearted, but with substantial content, that will help you web development career."
8819,"HTML and CSS parts of the course are not the best, but the JavaScript part is the best you can find on vanilla JavaScript on Coursera."
8820,Pretty simple and handy overviewing of JS. Like it!
8821,great tutorial and assignments
8822,"It is pretty an interesting course, especially the practical tasks, but, after all, it is much better for those who already knows the technologies mentioned in the title. The information is given very quickly during the lectures, so it may be not so useful for web development beginners (even regarding possible background in other areas of software development). That is why I recommend that course for those who is looking for a good HTML, CSS, and JS revision, not introduction."
8823,Excellent
8824,Nice course
8825,Excellent Instructor - David Rossiter.Thank you so much.
8826,It is a good course. Just need more hands on training to practice exercises
8827,understandable
8828,this course is great thanx to professor David RossiterI've finished it with success thank you Mr Rossiter
8829,"Omg ,I wish I had these professors to teach us in our college.I have started loving HTML&lt;CSS and Javascript.Being a total newbie to programming I have loved how clear and slow and easy to understand the videos are. Thank you so much and looking forward to completing the entire series. PS:the questions in between the lectures are very helpful and assignments are very very helpful too."
8830,the instructor is amazing 
8831,Very helpful
8832,A great course that covers nice topics.

8835,This course is a nice introduction to web development.
8836,Excellent course for those who want to kick-start in front-end development. Professor Rossiter is genius!
8837,awesome
8838,Very Straight forward and explicit.
8839,"very hard for beginners, very boring for others. also missleading concepts"
8840,Great course!
8841,i have great learning form this course and i love to learn more and more form Coursera
8842,Amazing!
8843,"The course is good, although the last exercise of the series is a bit too challenging if you want people that have just started with javascript to pass. Also, sometimes it focuses too much on theory and high level examples that don't build up into practical uses of javascript. "
8844,It Was very successful to me 
8845,Easy to understand and faster to learn
8846,one can be a rookie with this course.
8847,Very Good Course with a very helpful assignments. 
8848,"It was excellent refresh of the knowledge! Not to deep, but good enough for the starting point. Also they give you all the topics beforehand, so you could skip something you know already. But I didn't do that, the course was so nice, that I listened even about the things I knew."
8849,It's a great course.
8850,great course and instructor.
8851,"An amazing course for everyone who is new to the environment of web designing, very helpful."
8852,"Excellent course! Very well thought out and introduced step by step. I'm on the third course in the series. This lays a great foundation. The assignments are great at taking previous exercise code and tailoring to new forms. It take a little extra effort and research, but will make you a better programmer."
8853,It is good to put your hands on the javascript when everyone else is using libraries and forgetting the basics. It is nice create the Matching Game. Good course.
8854,Awesome Explaination
8855,"It teaches you the basics of html css and javascript. For a starter course in spec. it is ok. I expected a little more from this course, but all in all it was good."
8856,"Everything they teach is in very good flow and interesting. The question they ask in between the video is also a good one for better understanding. I cannot find more better than this one. It make you want to learn more, watch more. It's my first experience in coursera, everything they do is awesome, like the weekly assignment, time given to complete the task which is make you want to do more........Thumbs up to this course lecture and Coursera team too."
8857,It's awesome. 
8858,Amazing!!!
8859,A good guide for beginner to learn???

8862,everything in this course is Perfect ... ^^
8863,Awesome! 
8864,"This course helps in understanding the basic and overall concepts in HTML, CSS and JavaScripts"
8865,this is very good course and it is very much helpful in creating skill of web development inside me.i am very much thankful of coursera .
8866,I'm pretty much always turned off when a course won't let those who are auditing the course (i.e. not paying) take the assessments. I'm dropping out.
8867,Very Interesting!
8868,It was very helpful and thanks a lot :)
8869,The student learns a lot of basics in a straightforward and fun way.
8870,Excellent Course. Perfectly Taught. Good Course Design
8871,"Too easy, please do not repeat the same thing three times, it's just a waste of time and I'm not stupid. It's also too academic and should focus more on how to build real websites.On the bright side, it does give you some basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Instead of this course, I would much more recommend following HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers by Yaakov Chaikin from John Hopkins university, it taught me good foundations + tricks and good practices for professional web front end developers."
8872,It is too easy.
8873," I wouldn't never recommend this course. The teacher gives you all inforation without normal explan. You have chanse to understand HTML and CSS, but Js . JS leguage need more deteils, exemples and explaining, who I didn't find in this course. The first course is a basis for late courses and so weak teacher. I took the next series of course coz I saw that there are other tacher"
8874,very good for start learning front-end. but you will need some programming skills to understand all features
8875,this is the second week being finished and I am so happy to follow this course it is really great.
8876,It's a little bit too easy.
8877,"This course is way too basic, so basic it doesn't even cover some of the essential basics, like explaining what the Box Model is in CSS. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because you can still learn SOMETHING with it if you are a complete newbie, but it is very far to be reliable if you are aiming to be a professional. There is a long road to go after you finish this course, which makes me think the certificate is almost pointless and worthless.It also uses things that are generally considered a bad practice (like using DOM event attributes in the HTML). It is okay to present that to the students, but you should also mention that while they are there, it is usually not recommended to use them and explain what would be the recommended practice.I have taken courses from other sites like Codeschools, Codecademy and Treehouse and left Coursera for later because I believed that getting a certificate would require me to have some expertise, but so far I feel kind of disappointed with the Full Stack package.I am hoping it will get better with the next modules."
8878,Everything is very good explain it.
8879,Great material with excellent assignments.
8880,"It??s very good for beginners, help me "
8881,Good basic knowledge to proceed with small projects and to continue the education
8882,"Interesting course, It can give you a challenge. As a person who is used to programming but knows nothing about OOP, the programs was reasonable difficult. Thanks David Rossiter."
8883,"Hi David ,I am happy to have been part of this course. I really enjoyed you way of teaching and i could also comprehend well. I request to tag me for all of your courses. Email ID: s.venkateshraman@gmail.comI also want to learn UI5 technology. Kindly tag me if there are any course done by you on the same..Thank u so much"
8884,Great course. However the videos were very boring at times.
8885,Very good introductory course.
8886,"Advance, but they made it simple :)"

8888,"Excellent Course and Instructor, very detail, it exceeded my expectations, "
8889,I enjoyed this course. The materials are presented in an easily understandable manner. The exercises are fun and good for learning.
8890,"Excelente curso, el profesor explica muy bien.Es para alguien que no tenga ning??n conocimiento en HTML, CSS y JS ya que establece las bases de estas tecnolog??as sin profundizar mucho. "
8891,I was searching for this type of lectures in different places...It is awesome one.
8892,I love the way Professor David teach all from the scratch. I feel i'm learning really fast with this course and hope to continue with the program :)

8895,nice course
8896,The course is very good.
8897,"Un curso muy f??cil de seguir, a pesar de su dificultad, debido a las buenas explicaciones del profesor y al seguimiento a trav??s de un s??lo proyecto para todo el curso que te ayuda a comprender todo mejor en su globalidad. 100% recomendable!"
8898,Great course! Learn the basics quickly!
8899,"The content was too basic, but good"
8900,It's very useful.
8901,Bestest Video tutorial i ever had
8902,"I have prior programming experience and have done a few courses on coursera. I found the course useful to gain a fair degree of proficiency in html,css &amp; javascript. The course is not easy and needs a lot of work. The exercises are also thoughtfully designed to make you apply your skills. I did not upgrade and did the exercises myself without the benefit of a peer review"
8903,"The teacher???s lectures are very lively, Weekly homework can consolidate what we learn., the form of interactive assessment can help us solve the problem, learn the merits of others."

8911,Amazing Course and very informative.
8912,Very good course for beginners :-)
8913,"Seemed very basic at the beginning and then got a lot more involved in the last week. I felt there was a lot of code samples to be pulled from, almost so much so that you barely needed to write javascript. More like copy and paste. Class was really easy. I did learn about some major topics of the DOM structure of HTML, so that was great."
8914,"Well taught course but the material for the homework assignments were basically given to us. The answers were handed to us in the homework description. Having said this, the assignments were good. One should have basic program "
8915,This great class! I have learned a lot. 
8916,Very good course
8917,"Very good! Even though I already had some web programming exp, I learned a lot of important basics I just did not learn before!"
8918,A good introduction to basic web-building.
8919,I really appreciate the way lectures are being organized and conducted. Bravo!

8929,Great course! Right level of complexity for people who have knowledge of programming.
8930,What a wonderful course designed by Hong Kong University. I am extremely happy after completing this course. As of now I have attended many courses but frankly telling the way Hong Kong University design the courses and explains is really awesome. Same experience I had when I was attending Server Side Development using Node JS designed by Hong Kong University. Awesome.. Simply Awesome .. 
8931,"Gives a great overview, though a bit more depth and content would have been great. Still, overall a great course for beginners!"
8932,"This course is excelent ! I have learned a lot.I am from the COBOL/ASSEMBLER era. This course helped me to consider going forward for more trainning in the internet field of knowledge. The course was very well delivered, I am really greatfull. from Venezuela: Luis Alberto Perez"
8933,"The courses are great. I enjoyed them a lot. I have one comment on the JavaScript topics though. Key concepts like JavaScript objects, closures, module pattern and Immediately Invoked Functions are not covered. I understand that JavaScript is a very broad subject but a quick review of those key points would be great for a student to continue reading further on its own."
8934,Gives you a strong basics.
8935,Excellent and very challenging course! Loved it!
8936,"Amazing Stuff, Nice to do this course."
8937,"If you keep doing each lecture practically, you will master what is taught. Great one. "

8939,Excellent course with good example and instruction.
8940,Course nicely organized and very clear to follow. Learned a lot!
8941,It is the best course from the best instructor
8942,"I appreciate the way in which the whole knowledge was presented ??? as simple as possible, in easy to understand English words. But I would prefer it if the course was divided into 4 weeks."

8944,Good teachers!In this course you've everything you need to start 
8945," Really useful! Well-explained and well-organized, affordable price. It helped me a lot for my job! Really worth it, I suggest it to every beginner who wants to know the bases and also some advanced features of html, css and javascript.. "

8963,good for beginning
8964,Great intro course for beginners!
8965,Very useful course. Great explanation and clear examples.
8966,"The instruction was clear and simple. The one topic I'm still having trouble with is the way Divs are positioned. The concepts around floating left and right make sense, but, when I put it into practice, I was not getting the same results as I was expecting. I would love to see a follow up video on this topic to make this concept simpler for me to understand."
8967,Great Learning Experience.
8968,Le cours est tr??s riche et bien enseign??.
8969, Excellence 
8970,it was good course learned alot
8971,Enjoyed it.
8972,Fantastic 
8973,"This course has well-organized structure , logical flow of knowledge , beneficial assignments and useful resources . Many Thanks to Coursera and The Hong Kong University Of Science and Technology ."
8974,"Helpfull course, tank you guys!"
8975,The course was well put together. The assignments are broad enough to cover everything you learnt in the tutorials. 
8976,Great course!
8977, super 
8978,Reasonable contents. Focus on very useful knowledge. Perfect for beginners.
8979,"The course is really good and full of details. However, if you have previous idea about HTML and CSS you will find some parts a bit slow. "
8980,"Very great course, the lectures were interactive, very fast and straight to the point."
8981,Good to be start from scratch 
8982,very good course. But it lacks open activities like those given in bootstrap course

8984,Great course
8985,"Good introduction course. Assignments could be bit harder, or maybe not so much guided."
8986,Very good as a first time exposure
8987,"Looks good, but the assignment a bit simple."
8988,It's not that difficult and challenging i though of.
8989,This course will just give overview and will be easy for only those who have some prior knowledge in programming.Anyone new to programming will have a hard time to get everything.Anyways it was atleast very helpful for me.
8990,good 
8991,"This course is a good introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The lectures were straightforward, and the assignments were good exercises of the lecture material. I gave it 4 stars, only because the task of learning HTML and CSS is a bit dry and boring. No fault of the instructor."
8992,very good course for the beginner
8993,very very helpful . Nicely crafted course .
8994,Gave me a great general knowledge of front end development. Of course there could have been a lot more information but it was just enough to get me interested in learning more on my own
8995,Fill in the blanks others courses I did about HTML. This one is complete and more uo-to-date and I have perceived it as directed to real corporate applications rather than to layouts that do not follow what the corporate market needs. The instructor is excellent as being simple and clear to a subject that must be approached in this way to keep you going on fast.
8996,very good course to start learning front end development
8997,Very clean and informative. Enhanced my skills for sure.
8998,Perfect course
8999,Good basic foundation of HTML and CSS. It will help if the grading rubric needs to be more flexible in order to assess smaller outcomes. I found it too binary to be of use for accurate assessment. 
9000,Great Course
9001,Good beginner course. I would've liked more assignments to really drive the points home. And maybe a bit less hand holding in the assignments
9002,"I like the course and professor.However, i think that examples could be a bit more interesting."
9003,Good course for beginners. The instructor explains the material very clearly.
9004,Excellent begining course for developing web pages

9006,Well Designed!
9007,Done
9008,"Great intro class and great instructor. He really knows how to clarify things to make sure people new to this aren't confused. He is only the instructor for this intro course, though. It is a different one for all the other courses in the specialization so keep that in mind. "
9009,I'll absolutely recommend this to anyone willing to learn.
9010,"A very well defined introduction to HTML, CSS &amp; JS. Easy to understand."
9011,Very poor CSS content
9012,Easy to start and sample project makes it more useful

9042,i really love the way tutor has explained things in detail. its makes easy to understand and implement .
9043,Excellent!
9044,I couldn't purchase the course but I did all the assignments and followed along with the lectures and the instructions. The part I liked the most was the project based way of learning. The slides were well prepared. All in all it was a good and faster way of getting an intro into HTML and Javascript.
9045,this is a great course
9046,"Excellent course to grasp the basics, with further readings and references if you want to learn more."
9047,Pretty good.

9057,"A good introductory course, perfect for beginners."
9058,Awesome training. Loved it!
9059,great!
9060,This was one of the best online courses I've taken so far!
9061,Well Structured course especially for beginners.Professor is quite majestic with his nature of interaction.Loved it !!!
9062,I love it
9063,Very good course.. Very crisp presentation. 
9064,Could have been used more practical approach and more advanced stuff.
9065,Very good
9066,Learned a lot from the course. Really beneficial. Loses a star due to having to mark other people's work - really time consuming! 
9067,The instructor is really awesome and he explains each and every concept mention in the course outline really well. The course is very helpful for the beginners. There is lot of things in this course that would increase your learning experience.
9068,Good for very beginners.
9069,Great Course!
9070,Excellent teacher and excellent information!

9076,"Good, but would be better with more examples and exercises of more key aspects."

9078,Good One.
9079,"if it was free course, it will nicer :)"
9080, Very interesting with nice teacher. 
9081,"This course has given me a general approach should be used as javascript, and helped me implement solutions without the need for utilzar framewors javascript. "
9082,Fantastic
9083,Excellent intro... Thank-you
9084,Excellent course and assignments and great presentation by David Rossiter.
9085,Excellent
9086,Excellent ! Even on the Free Mode. Thank you so much.
9087,"Professor is really goooood! He explains the material from the slides, just as if you were in an actual class, i.e. he doesn't read from some screen. Assignments are challenging but easy at the same time because you submit the full versions in incremental steps. Good learning experience. However, I feel the course is a bit expensive for a three week period."
9088,"Awesome Course, basics that get you up and running, probably have to buy a book to continue but at least you now know where to start from. "
9089,Very good! I learn a lot from it!
9090,"Well done. Focuses mainly on videos to teach the content with an assignment at the end of the week that uses everything you learned. I would rate 5 stars if it had more quizzes or exercises to do before the week's assignment. At any rate you learn a lot about Html, css, and JS and it's a worthy class in this specialization."
9091,Great assignments and bad videos.
9092,"Great course ,good for beginners to start with"
9093,"Good lectures, interesting quizes, good assessments. Perfect! "
9094,"Very informative, especially for those who begginers like me"
9095,It is a nice course. Covered the basics with step by step instructions and examples.
9096,Really good to a html/css/javascript introduction. That course will provide the basic stuff you need to know to start learning web development.
9097,"If you want to be a web developer and have no knowledge of html and css then you can start from this for sure, the basics are cleared in a very good way and the exercises are hard enough to ue your brain for the exercises."
9098,"Interesting and understandable, great lecturer."
9099,Super course!! Nice explanatory videos and challenging assignments.
9100,I look forward to more of your classes!
9101, Wow very nice! 
9102,"Great course for brushing up on basic web design, but doesn't really provide any more information than what W3Schools already has on their site. Don't expect a deep dive into JS -- it's just enough to give you some ideas on how to manipulate elements within your website."
9103,"Very good course! Is goes straight to coding, so it??s really fun!"
9104,I was surprised how good it was.
9105,great course!!
9106,Good overview of HTML/CSS/Javascript. Nice audio/video quality and preparation. Fun homework assignments and examples. Would have liked more CSS touches. 
9107,Good Course ! 
9108,Good Starter
9109,this course is really good to understand who things work together in front-end web development. And it develops my understanding towards using while and for loops specifically by the really good and smart assignments.

9120,Very useful course.
9121,Videos are simple and easy to understand.
9122,Great cource for beginners. Thanks for refreshing my knowledge
9123,I love this course it is very useful for me.Thanks for this course.
9124,The professor really needs to make the course more exciting - you don't need to be educated to know enthusiasm promotes content reception.
9125,"We are given inadequate information in the videos, and no other resources, to write a program. Required to use methods not covered in the course."
9126,Very well explained. Concise and clear.
9127,very detailed and understandable html and css teaching
9128,It's a complete and well-organized introduction to these technologies presented in a very clear way.
9129,superb course
9130,Very clear introduction to the basics of front-end.
9131,I love the assignments. It really helps me understand and remember how to use all the components and functions.

9133,A decent Course.
9134,Great course for begineer
9135,"Nice videos, nice content... incredible didactic! Coursera recommend a little knowledge from students, however you can learn web development concepts by zero! Recommended! "
9136,"Simple and effective! I liked it very much, even though I already knew quite a bit of the whole thing. "
9137,Excellent course and interesting assignments.
9138,It was a good course. It is hard to make it useful and interesting for everyone since students will have varying degrees of knowledge coming in. I know that I learned a lot that I can apply in my work.
9139,great course especially the JS part
9140,Simply great!
9141,"Well organized, and explained very clear, easy to understand. I like the pace of this course, not too fast but you can learn plenty of things from it"
9142,"An amazing course! The introduction to JavaScript was particularly useful for me. Clear lectures, well explained assignments and a lot of fun!"
9143,a good job

9147,Great course !
9148,It's not bad but I think the other courses in this specialization are much better
9149,practical
9150,"Very good introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a college CS major, I came in with almost 0 experience in the material reviewed in the course, and have completed the course with what I feel to be a strong understanding. A+ work by the team that created the curriculum"
9151,"Muy bueno, me ha encantado"
9152,Did not email when graded and had to email for everything to be fixed. Example projects were not similar at all to actual projects and relied heavily on search engines to figure out what was asked of me 
9153,"This is an excellent course. The instructor explains things very well, the material includes all the important points, and the assignments are very well constructed. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning the fundamentals of website development."

9157,Well planned course. A little too easy though
9158,Loved it!
9159,"A nice, short introductory course to web programming languages. May move a little fast for a newbie."
9160,A complete course for a beginner. 
9161,"This course was very nice. It was kind of a bit basic, but that's what I've expected of a beginner course which is covering basic and the most important factors of web technologies. The reason I give 4 stars is that everything is too much served on the plate. Assignments are prepared really, really well, which kind of loses the point. You almost don't need to think about anything to finish the assignment. Overall, awesome course!"
9162,Awesome!Perfect!
9163,Nice course
9164,"Nice course, although it could be even better if it lasted for 4 weeks, where the last week would cover pure javascript in much more depth."
9165,very good for Web beginners : a must
9166,A complete and didactic course.
9167,"Expecially the final part, best node explain I ever seen. Thanks Mr. Rossiter!"
9168,"Good course that is very well structured. I learnt a lot about the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript."
9169,Awesome introductory course for beginners. Liked it very much.
9170,"Good teacher, simple learning, maybe too basic, mostly with CSS"
9171,One week shorter than other similar courses but the eLearning lectures are of excellent quality and the assignments do stretch you to learn 
9172,"This course teaches you the basic concepts of HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can learn quite a bit. I was already familiar with HTML and CSS but not with pure Javascript. So i learned a little bit more of Javascript."
9173,Good course!
9174,Excellent introduction of the techologies. 
9175,Very fun and useful course! Would have rated 5 stars if it provided a little more in depth technical information and options as a kind of free to dive in addition to the course material.
9176,very useful!
9177,It is a great introduction course for people who do not have any knowledge about html and css.
9178,super

9198,Best course ever had!!!
9199,Very good and didatic. It was very instructional.

9229,The instructor goes in depth and he has a way of explaining the material very clearly.
9230,"In my opinion this course is too simple for anyone who have a bit of programming experience. On other hand, it is a base course and it is excellent for any other person with no experience. "
9231,Very fun course and clear to understand. I would redo them just for fun but don't have time for that yet!
9232,"Excellent course, the only thing that prevented me from giving 5-starts is that it would be extremely helpful if we received feedback from the host school. Given the nature of Coursera, I know this is unfeasible, but it would still be nice. Otherwise, it's the blind leading the bind scenario. Given all that, I'd still recommend this course to anyone without reservation."
9233,I think this course is very successful.

9270,"Awesome course, especially for newbies "
9271,"Amazing course! Very good explanation and the structure is perfect, worth it!"

9284,very nice presentation and content for beginners
9285,great course
9286,Good course. Good teacher.
9287,A bit too simple for my liking. And too many repeated content. But overall a good course for an absolute beginner.
9288,"Very clear and understandable English, which is crucial for not native speakers. Having fun so far, thanks!"
9289,"Some prior knowledge is assumed, but the course does cover everything, although the basics are glanced over very quickly.HTML and Javascript coverage was excellent, but I felt that a little more time could have been spent on more complex CSS."
9290,Excellent course! I am learning so much!
9291,A brilliant course. I had a great time going through the lectures and had fun with the assignments. Thank you for this course.
9292,real good so far
9293,"Very very good, I learnt so much in this course.Thanks coursera for the oportunity."
9294,This is THE most awesome course on Coursera!!!
9295,"Quickly covered basic HTML, JS, and CSS.Assignment descriptions were clear.There were a few tricky bits mostly related to styling that were more frustrating than it seems like they should have been, but overall a very good course. However, the project time given for the course is very optimistic, it usually always took much longer."
9296,"I tried to study HTML, CSS and JS at first. Because his lectures was so detail, I could understand it. "
9297,"Overall, I found the course to be an excellent refresher and, in some ways, an expander of my existing HTML, CSS and JS knowledge. The only suggestion I would offer is to explain how and why the particular information is useful. Examples can cement an abstract concept. "

9299,Very basic course for those who don't have any basic knowledge
9300,Good one! Nice professor :)

9304,Teacher was very good.
9305,very good course
9306,Nice!

9308,Unnecessary course for this kind of specialization... 
9309,"I am a Java Expert and over 10 years of experience in Software Engineering. So a lot things like controle structures are well know to me. However it was never boring and I had a lot of fun getting into HTML, CSS and JavaScript."
9310,The course covers up all the basics in the most clear way. Definetely worth the time!
9311,"I love the way that the course is explained and designed. The questions during the videos helped me to understand every concept. Now, I feel better programming using HTML and JAVASCRIPT. "
9312,wonderful
9313,The teaher of this class is excellent gives example and answers in all your questions and doubts about the how and why everything happens.I think it's a lesson you have to watch if you want to learn how to build your website or your app(wep app) !! 
9314,Very nicely taught. Short and precise
9315,Perfect (Y)
9316,I just started this course.I have seen the course outline and i can state categorically that it is the real thing.

9340,"This course is amazing for people without any knowledge on HTML,CSS or JS.Even if you do have it, it helps understanding some basic stuff regarding each one.If you moved from basic JS to Angular.JS i suggest you take this course to understand how the DOM structure work because it could be very important for to understand how people used to write JS programs and on what Angular.JS is based."
9341,Course is well structured and very helpful!
9342,Very well presented and informative. Some of the early assignments are hard to grade if the person makes a small mistake and the only possible marks are 0% and 100%.
9343,Very thorough and consistent teaching. David is just GREAT!
9344,"Challenging but not impossible to do. Professor Rossiter has a nice way of teaching things.The DOM model explanations are a bit confusing when first listening to it, but become clear later when putting it into action with a lot of trial and error."
9345,Excellent course. :)
9346,"This course is very deailed on HTML, and also shows how to make forms and send data."
9347,Great instructor. The course is concise but full of good observations about how to use HTML and Javascript.
9348,"Valuable course as a start point, got a general overview of all components in a web system and also got started on basic front end design."
9349,Very Good
9350,"Really goog course, their is a lot to learn."
9351,Muy buen profesor y considero una buena introducci??n de fondo para comenzar el desarrollo Web.
9352,"Learning new skill through succinct teaching was a wonderful experience. The course covered good details of the programming languages, but personally I think it was not in-dept learning. I think more learning material along with advanced assignments should be provided for more vivid learners.Overall, it was a course worth taking for me.-Bhushan "
9353,Excellent!!!!!!!!
9354,Ecellent Course
9355,excellent class!
9356,"Very thorough, and the learning exercises definitely force you to use what you've learned properly."
9357,excellent

9359,This course is designed very well.
9360,This course was really useful for me. Good teacher and material.
9361,Excellent introduction.
9362,Very useful for web developers beginners.
9363,Nice course for basic learning and strong foundations!!
9364,Content is good enough for beginners in web development but must have previously programming experience. The assignments are very strong and help understanding more. I think this is a good start point but some other operation on images and styles not covered.
9365,"The detailed step by step class made me understood this course clearly. David made it easy for beginners to understand this course.In general, reviewing the classmate's assignment is definitely a great idea to learn from other's code and improve your coding skill."
9366,David Rossiter is an excellent Instructor. He was very clear and precise. I learned a lot and as a result I purchased the series.
9367,Good course to teach you the basics :) 
9368,Great course. I finally learned CSS and Javascript!
9369,"Completed this course today and it was a very good learning experience. Like Professor said, it is a good start to learn Javascript.The teaching style was simple and to the point. Hope to take another course by Professor Rossiter soon."
9370,Great course!
9371,Very nice introduction. Very structured and good assignments.
9372,Teaching method is great !

9392,this course is great....
9393,"Amazing course, really complete. I've been able to learn a lot of things about web development in just three weeks. Thanks for this course!"
9394,Very helpful
9395,One of the best professor in the world
9396,Excellent professor and excellent explanation. Loved this course with th assignments.
9397,"Well detailed course with very good instructor who makes this course more interesting. But one more thing, the assignment is not fully related to the lectures and materials. Students need to read and learn by themselves from other sources to learn more for completing the assignments. This is tough for students who do not have programming background and join here to learn. "
9398,An interesting course to introduce the basic concepts of HTML. I had a background about HTML however I learned new things.
9399,Great course . It is really worth taking a shot.
9400,Excelente oportunidade de aprendizado.
9401,"Great course, very good for beginners who would like to study HTML, CSS &amp; JS."
9402,"Very intresting and easy to learn, even for those who didn`t speak english very well! "
9403,Excellent course! It was a great refresher for me on HTML and CSS. It has been a great and funny introduction to Javascript as well
9404,"Gives you needed basics on HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the rest of the specialisation. However, could definitely expand the JS aspects a lot more. Explaining the type system, the prototype chain concepts, making us aware of what the language can and can not do. 1 to 2 more weeks would have been expected from this course."
9405,I learned a lot and I liked the homework assignments and the length of the course only being 3 weeks.
9406,"It is two hard for beginners, or the lectures should be more detailed because assignments are hard. And on the another hand there are two much information and lectures for one week. It should be less lectures and information for one week. In this way it has two much load for person who works. It should be stretched trough more then 3 week for example 6 weeks with less lecturers with assignments that are graduly get difficult. Because first assignment is to big jump."
9407,"Very good class, professor is very entertaining. Concepts take into account the latest &amp; greatest of HTML &amp; JS. In general, i think a price of $79 is too high for a MOOC class of 3 weeks duration "
9408,Overall a good course!
9409,Excellent course! I really enjoyed this!
9410,Great course for those who already have some prior knowledge of html css and js. 
9411,Great!
9412,done very well that even us novices could follow
9413,very good . 
9414,I enjoyed learning this course. very highly dedicated faculty members and timely help was key in this course
9415,"This course is very effective to build up the basic foundation of HTML,CSS and JS."
9416,"It was such an honor to learn the course from the Coursera.The materials provided, going through the depth of every thing, forum discussions and the assignment submissions are the best things provided here.I would also like to thank Prof. David Rossiter for mentoring us throughout the course and let us aware about the technologies which form the backbone of the Web Development."
9417,"Good well delivered course. Sometimes the instruction is a little repetitive, but that may be a good thing for beginners. The instructions can also sometimes be a bit vague, overall a good course though."
9418,Not happy with the quality of the material. Dropped the whole specialization halfway through this class. 
9419,Good course
9420,very good course
9421,clear without any crap
9422,helpful course
9423,very clear and accessible
9424,"This is a pretty good course for learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I already had some experience with these three languages, so consider that when reading this review. I found that the amount of information they cram into this three week course was pretty substantial, which I think is a positive aspect of the course. They don't just teach you what you need to complete the exercises, they teach you a lot of things that even more experienced users of this language may have forgotten. That being said, I don't think the amount of information covered is realistically anyone could retain in three weeks. I would instead see this course as a crash course as to what features are available with these three languages, then save the course slides as sort of a reference for when you go off on your own. My favorite part of this course is that the exercises are unique and fun. The HTML assignment is sort of boring, but that's because HTML is boring, but the exercises that use javascript are a lot of fun. To conclude, I think this course would be great for brand new web developers and also for people who just need a refresher. Good luck!"
9425,Excellent course and an excellent professor!
9426,Rich and useful course. I enjoyed the homeworks so much very fruitful :)
9427,Extraordinario poder disfrutar de este aprendizaje con esta metodolog??a al alcance de todos.
9428,great and easy
9429,useful course.
9430,Very good course. I like it very much.
9431,its very good
9432,Course is good as an introduction. explanation of various other important properties in CSS to build a web page with different layouts could have been an added advantage. Though the course has given me a good understanding. 
9433,easy to learn!thanks
9434,Very clear and easy to understand.
9435,"Fast and to the point. The way i like it. 3 weeks and you're set up to where you can get around in HTML, CSS and Java."
9436,Excellent very good introduction especially recommended javascript
9437,"Take this course if you want to get depressed out of ever learning any programming.The structure is this:-tons of info about stuff with unclear application-tons of info about stuff with unclear application-tons of info about stuff with unclear application-a gigantic task where you don't actually use half of the material from before, but instead need to use some material from the future module or from just googling things.You never get to understand why what you wrote didn't work and why it should be the way your classmate wrote it.The course makers don't seem to be interested in your feedback."
9438,This is a great intro course about front end web programming. I do Recomend
9439,here I got to learn about HTML DOM and its manipulation throught Javascript.Thanx!!
9440,"Its ok and I liked the exercises, but I think you see to many themes and there is almost no practice for them. Its hard to learn them."
9441,"One of the best course I have ever take, what I like the most is on assignment part. The lecturer give me a good instruction of assignment which helped me did it perfectly. Step by step, knowing that I need to develop these step by step logic required to solve the problems."
9442,So far so good
9443,"The best course for absolute beginners, and also professionals who forgot to write javascript code without jquery! "
9444,This class does not go in depth enough for debutant people to figure out how to do the assessments or gain a good understanding of what is covered. 
9445,"Excellent material, Knowledgeable trainer, Nice short quiz and exercises, hands-on assignments with clues and study materials. Last but not the least, reviewing others assignments and learning from others. Really enjoyed learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. "
9446,just enroll
9447,This is excellent course with very detailed outline but with simple and step by step learning with relevant examples.
9448,Very efective course to start. 
9449,Great course.. Simple and exhaustive!

9451,Well organized course material. Detailed examples illustrates the concepts in a clear way.
9452,Very well structured. A good introduction course. 
9453,Great teacher and an excellent intro to front end development.
9454,Just excellent!!!
9455,"Javascript &amp; HTML are covered nicely for a 3 week course &amp; enables us to learn anything new from the web on our own. The course lacks in the coverage of CSS (Hence the 4 stars &amp; not 5).The final project was very nice &amp; interesting, so much so that I have been developing it further &amp; have added many more features to it."
9456,"Excellent course, well paced, assignments greatly aid in the learning of html and javascript."
9457,Very good course for begineers
9458,"That was one amazing course, dave is a great teacher, and all the material is very intuitive, clear and easy to comprehend, I'm very grateful to everyone involved in making this amazing course."

9460,awesome course i've leart a lot
9461,"Teaches a lot of important stuff, but a bit fast paced for my liking."
9462,"The course is very useful as a starting point in developing skills as a web developer. The videos are very well structured: not to long and the content is very handy as your guide when doing the assignments. The teacher does an excellent job: he is very clear, systematic and sometimes funny, too. Highly recommended."
9463,I like this course since it's built well and the lectures are light and fun .
9464,I liked a lot that there are many short topic-specific videos and that I could download the self-explanatory slides. The concept of reviewing other participants' assignment worked well.
9465,"The course content is well designed and full material (PDFs and HTML files) is openly shared. The best part is assignments, there are challenging and awesome. I am glad that I took this course."
9466,"Great introduction course covering the basic building blocks of modern web applications. The lectures are easy to follow, with plenty hands-on exercises."
9467,HIghly recommended!.
9468, I like your course. Thanks David Rossiter.
9469,"This course covered a lot of ground in only 3 weeks. It gave me the knowledge and confidence to create a JavaScript solution to a website problem shortly after I finished it. It is structured logically, with well-planned exercises that reinforce learning. "
9470,great assignments
9471,"Very good class, not only lecture,but the homework also very good ."
9472,Liked the class
9473,"A very good introduction class for the basics of web development. Don't expect to come out a full fledged Javascript programmer but it gives you the important parts of DOM manipulation. If you want to start with web development, go and check this class out. "
9474,excelente curso
9475,"I have very minimal coding experience and what I knew before coming into this was very spotty, and pulled from numerous different sources. This is a GREAT course for beginners looking to get a solid understanding of the fundamentals of coding in a few widely used languages and it helped me out a ton! Thanks for providing this great and well laid out course! "
9476,really good course!!
9477,"This is great course for beginners. All lessons built with a lot of practice, and thanks to David Rossiter everything clear and easy to understand. Thanks a lot Coursera team for this opportunity. You do a great job."
9478,Great course. They throw everything at you but the lectures are well presented and full of knowledge. Best bang for the buck that I have had so far with a MOOC.
9479,great course! Everything is clear and well explained. 
9480,The instructor was great. He was very thorough and I really loved the final project. I had a great time taking this course!
9481,quick intro of html css &amp; js; but not deep enough to get more pro on it
9482,good
9483,great course.
9484,"very good at getting his point across and, I found that he always explained with good depth. I would recommend this course to anyone"
9485,It is a very well planned and structured course! I think it gives you a starting point to know all the web development core. 
9486,"Interesting, easy to understand and appropriately filled course. All you need on the beginning of web development. Thank you!"
9487,Great introductory course to the basics of web development. David is straightforward and clear with his presentations. Though the course is only 3 weeks long so you have practice to keep your skills sharp.
9488,"Excellent course on the fundamental building blocks of the web. Even though I thought I knew these topics, I still learned some things I didn't know, and had fun doing so!"
9489,"Awesome designed course, even for people with some knowledge of the subject. I loved the assignments. "
9490,"Great for beginners, the basics are well explained."
9491,Very basic and not especially much fun or challenging

9503,Great course! The professor is doing an incredibly good work at delivering the material in an accessible and understandable way! I wish he had more courses on Coursera. I would attend all of them. TOP!!!Thank you!
9504,great
9505,"A good course, the methods and pace was not good enough. I wonder if those new to these topics learnt anything"
9506,The videos just gloss over the materials.... No comprehensive lecture notes or standard textbook and lessons are too squeezed.
9507,"Very Good Indeed!Instructor goes thru quite a number of HTML, CSS and JavaScript examples.A good starting point."
9508,"The course deserves to be registered and followed. It worth for newbies to learn these technologies HTML, CSS and JS. The course follows with lectures, practice questions and weekly assignment which make the learner keep interested during the course. Instructor is an Intelligent and Awesome personality. He teaches really very well.. Recommended for Newbies !!"
9509," Nice course! I've learnt a lot. Thank you, David. "
9510,A very good course and covers a wide range of topics especially in JavaScript.
9511,"This is a great course overall, but it might be a bit hard to follow for those who have no prior programming experience."
9512,Really good.
9513,Excellent !!
9514,The assessments are great to handle the concepts of the course. Particularly evaluating the work of others is very instructing. The instructor is great and is a pleasure to listen to.
9515,Course is presented with great details ans a handful of materials. Definitely it is a very interesting web course. 
9516,Excellent course. Material is explained with simple words and examples. Student is encouraged to look for additional resources.
9517,"PROF, David Rossiter is a real professional. Knows what he are saying about and provide all needed information to learners shortly and straightforward! It is big please to see videos with him. Another big thanks for his great humor! So HTML, CSS and Javascript learning gave me very big pleasure and very wide knowledge! Thank you Dave! "
9518,Very very good course :)
9519,Very compact and intensive course. Love the great opportunity to learn from such a good teacher.
9520,It's a well designed course and you can do homework with what you just learn. All of these knowledge give your a basic concept of HTML + CSS???JavaScript.
9521,David was able to clearly and enthusiastically present what's really a rather dry subject. 
9522,Amazing online class and learning environment.
9523,Awesome
9524,Amazing presentation. Good content
9525,"Great experience, designed for noobies and also for people who have some knowledge on the subjects. It??s being a great pleasure to learn this course. Also available on my Ipad and on my Android smartphone, so I can download the video classes and carry with me. Recommend, A+."
9526,"Es una introducci??n muy completa. Es necesario aprender simultaneamente dobre los tres lenguajes, ya que la funcionalidad de los mismos se veria muy limitada al no hacerlo."
9527,Great course
9528,"Javascript part of the course was very interesting, especially the lessons regarding DOM."
9529,"All the course material is great and helpfull, I had a great time doing this course and learned a lot from it! Thanks to the University of Science and Technology from Hong Kong to provide such an amazing material."
9530,Very good and systematical introduction to basics.
9531,"I have limited programming experience (less than four months of Java) and prior, brief exposure to HTML and CSS. This course was a great refresher for HTML and CSS, and the introduction to JavaScript is useful and pretty straightforward."
9532,"I enjoyed the course to review my CSS/HTML skills and get started on JavaScript. I would recommend this course if you have some preliminary experience. If you are completely new to these materials it might be worth doing an introductory course first, as this course is fast-paced and for a beginners many details might be missing. "
9533,awesome course. like d way prof david taught
9534,Good Intro to the front-end holy trinity!
9535,The professor teach this course very well
9536,excellent course! I really enjoy the way it is taught. I recommend it 100%
9537,Very professional course. I learnt a lot of good stuff!
9538,great course and clearly explained by Dave.
9539,I would be much more happier if i can contact the instructor directly
9540,"Challenging, but I learnt a lot. A lot of debugging in the final assignment - that's probably what programming is. "
9541,Very usefull and fascinating course.
9542,Great teach
9543,Great course. Well designed and motivating to learn!
9544,"Great course, go strait to the point. You will learn the basics of Html CSS and Javascript with the smile. "
9545,The Professor`s style and knowledge of the subject he teaches are on the edge!
9546,very very very very.... very useful
9547,Very good course for beginners with no experience or prior knowledge. The lessons and projects were designed well to have you put together everything you learned in the courses at the end.
9548,"I really love it, but i just don't have that much time for the course. I wish I have more time to spend to learn more from the course (personal time management issue). "
9549,"This course is very good for people who want to get some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. While it is not that long, it gives you practical experience and teaches you to do some practical things. I'd rather recommend it to people who already have some basic experience with web and programming (in any language), but the bar is not that high even for beginners. Module videos and explanations are good and David Rossiter, who created the course, has my thanks and respect. "
9550,very good course but it is kinda fast for new people 
9551,"Great course, great instructor!"
9552,"The course is an excellent satrting guide for anyone who needs a mild introduction to html, CSS and javascript. Most important basics and it moves you to some advanced aspects. Overall you appreciate the concepts more because of the nature of assignments. "
9553,"By far, one of the best basics courses out there. "
9554,It's just AWESOME!!!
9555,"A nice introductory course, short but with a lot of stuff covered, good for busy people. I only miss some jquery introduction. Thanks professor David Rossiter."
9556,"It covers a lot in a short time, definitely helped me gain some more knowledge."
9557,"HTML, CSS and JavaScript course is great! Professor David Rossiter made a great job explaining in detail all important aspects of each of these languages. Assignments were interesting and sometimes not easy, but they shouldn't be easier. Overall, in my opinion this course is extremely beneficial for beginners in web development."
9558,It is wonderful course and very clear explanations given by them.
9559,It's quite too simple even with no previous knowledge
9560,"The course is well designed and well presented. I wished for a bit more material on CSS and JavaScript. Perhaps, due to time constraints, there could be a separate course for looking at CSS and JavaScript at a more in-depth level."
9561,It the One of the Best course in HTML CSS and JavaScript Excise is fun and the assignment is totally challenging. I recommend this course. Just go for it.
9562,"Very good course - requires dedication, concentration and hard work. I think that I got a lot, but still long way is in front of me. It depends what are you searching for in online course - that is crucial question, for my vision this was perfect choice, right to the target. Thanks a lot!"
9563,"If you don't have any experience in HTML, CSS or JavaScript, this is a very good introduction to that topic. It covers all the basics which are needed to be able to follow the next courses of this module. Also the lecturer speaks very clear and it is very easy to understand him."
9564,"The instructions are in detail, and is suitable for those who are not familiar with web."
9565,pretty good
9566,"This course was very informative, challenging and productive. Well designed, it helped me learn a lot!"
9567,Excellent course by David Rossiter. One of the best online courses that I have attended. Super Stuff
9568,Good for begineers...
9569,"Very detailed and great, clear lectures. Very good quizzes and hands-on assignments. Highly recommended for absolutely beginner."
9570,Good place to learn the basics of web development.
9571,"Does not tell everything there is to know about HTML, CSS and JS but covers the basics and a bit beyond and does it well. I have been thought about DOM before but this is the first time I started to understand what it really is and what can be done with it. That was probably the best part. I recommend this course."
9572,"The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html/css and fully dives into JavaScript. If you are not familiar with JavaScript, I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering. Still if you are a total noob, you should take the course anyway, as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object-oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer.Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues, grading, and discussion board input, I gave the course a 3 out of 5. My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though. "
9573,"Very well explained, very carefully designed course I have to say. Good to see that so clearly organized. Only one thing maybe, I found the assignments, especially the last one, not very close to what I expected (like form validation...), maybe not too interesting. But maybe I'm wrong, I see that as a newbie in JavaScript. "
9574,great course. fast paced for the absolute beginner
9575,Excellent course! Content is easy to comprehend and flexible. Professor is good having clear communication. I highly recommend this course for the beginners or if you want to refresh theses skills.
9576,a good start to learn web design from this course.
9577,Great course full with thought provoking assignment!
9578,"Well-designed courses, good exercises."
9579,Pretty straightforward but explores many web design concepts.
9580,"Good explanations, good instructors"
9581,it's a good course to learn for beginners
9582,It is very clear and easy to follow for non-IT background students. Highly recommended to start!
9583,Awesome Course.. Improved my skills to a new extend..
9584,"The course and specialization looks promising but I get the feeling that the instructors have been a little lazy while designing the assignments. Instead of auto-grading using well known testing frameworks (like other Coursera courses), the entire grading policy is based on reviews from fellow students which makes your grade subjective, secondly, since the number of mandatory required reviews for each student is fixed at 5 (and is not adjusted with the number of students), it is highly unlikely that all submissions will be reviewed or graded."
9585,Great Course ....Good assignments and Great lectures
9586,"If all teacher were to present their lectures in the manner this course was presented, I don't think any student would find it difficult to understand the subject, no matter have hard it is. They made web programming a seem like taking a nice cup of tea!"
9587,"I thought the course was extremely informational, and I actually enjoyed doing the assignments at the end of each week."
9588,This course is very clear and easy to follow. 
9589,"Great course. Liked it a lot. It was very tough in the beginning. At the first week I almost died, from lack of understanding. But as the course went on it was easier and easier. And more pleasurable since I started to understand the basics."
9590,this course is awesome
9591,Muy bueno!!!
9592,I loved learning the course
9593,Nice explanations. Examples and presentation are very easy to understand.Congratulations!!!
9594,Really awesome coursework and brilliant teaching!!
9595,Very informative and challenging
9596,Excellent!
9597,Excellent tutorial on the topic. Better than any other tutorial on this topic present in the Internet by far.
9598,"This class was a great introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for someone with prior programing experience (I've done Python, R, MATLAB, and a tiny bit of C++). It was exactly the overview of all the basic/most important features of the three languages (I use quotes because HTML is actually a language). By no means will this make you any kind of expert, but if you're interested in web development on the side and already know how to program, this is a great place to start."
9599,"Very good course. Whether you're a beginner or intermediate, this course will boost your skills in HTML, CSS and JS. One of the best courses I've taken in a while. "
9600,"Hastily put together. Quickly steps over lots of material, some of it is out of order. There is an entire video in week three, that covers material needed to complete the assignment the week before, for example."
9601,This is really a very good and perfect base for web developers who start their career..!!
9602,"Best course to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The assignments provided in this course are really strong and made me understand the things learned in the course."
9603,nice course for begginers
9604,It's very good ...
9605,Very interesting introductory course.
9606,"This was a pretty nice course about html css and javascript. Small drawback, the html part did not focus on any of the newly introduced semantic tags and did rather use anonymous divs and spans. Although this may still work it is already pretty bad style therefore I had wished that for people just starting with html5 the course would try to teach them the language using the latest introduced standard."
9607,"Good and interesting course. I think it should have a bit more formalization. For example, in HTML part there was no information about W3C validation tool. Also for example there was no accent on some essential parts of HTML:1. According the W3C specification, the src attribute of &lt;img&gt; tag must be present2. There was no accent that for attribute of &lt;label&gt; tag should correspond to the ID of form element so in homework review I saw situations when this attribute was set to name instead of ID."
9608,very nice introduction for all beginer
9609,Great course. Excellent instructor.
9610,"This is an excellent short course for someone who knows some programming and/or is somewhat familiar with HTML. If you do not know anything whatsoever, the pace may be a bit too fast. But if you are a bit familiar with programming (in any language), you will enjoy the course immensely and learn an awful lot."
9611,This course covers a lot of ground and builds a good foundation of knowledge in the subject.
9612,"The teacher was great, videos, organisation...I??m really glad to have done this course. I??m going to get more knowledge and change my professional career. Now I believe that is possible. "
9613,"Content is good but can include more advanced topics in Javascript like various patterns eg IIFE, Module etc. Also, I reckon there should have been some material on Javascript classes,objects etc. As a whole this tutorial is excellent but could have been even better wit above topics included in detail. "
9614,It was very educative.
9615,but its better if u can give us little more time (sometimes we are sick or traveling )
9616,"I think it's useless. Spending that amount of time explaining this basics it is not worth it. I'd rather go deeper in AngularJS, NodeJS or Ionic, after all this is a course for a mid level, so you should go to another course to take the basics and here a more advanced level."
9617,Good teaching
9618,"This course has a very good level , very well structured , I enjoyed doing it and I learned a lot of things in a very short period of time .It is very intensive and very professionnal."
9619,Very detail
9620,Nice introduction 
9621,"this course really helpful to build basement about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
9622,Excellent 
9623,Great introductory Course! The professor was easy to understand and took the time to explain in a clear and concise manner! Great job!
9624,Good course. Happy to have finished it!
9625,Gives you the basics what you need to develop your skills further! Good one!
9626,Great course! The materials are sufficient and the weekly assignment is very helpful for me to practice what I learned.
9627,"This course is really good and interesting for people, who want to understand basics of HTML, CSS and JS."
9628,"Very nice and complete introduction to html,css and javascript!Great teacher. Explanation was very clear, and assignment help to improve what have you learned during the lessons! "
9629,superb course
9630,Awesome course!!!
9631,Great course!!
9632,I have enjoyed this course a lot. The lectures are good and the assignments interesting. The grading process could be a little less 0/1... all or nothing is a little harsh. But it is a small flaw.
9633,"I'm not giving the fifth star just because there is only one flaw: not enough interaction between the teacher/TAs and the students. In fact, I never saw the staff participating in the discussions."
9634,great point to start learning web development
9635,"Great introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript"
9636,Good introduction to the base of web developpment
9637,"This course is one such model: in particular could not be better structured. David Rossiter is clear, synthetic, attractive .. All the ingredients to make you want to take the course until the last slide and the last word has been formulated. "
9638,Nice introduction to web development.
9639,Good introductory course to some essential components of Web Development! 
9640,"It was difficult for me but it challenged me and I got through it. For only three weeks I felt my understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript had improved significantly."
9641,Lecturer explains very well. Content very well sequenced
9642,Great overview and introduction to the fundamentals in web development
9643,"excellent lecture, awesome resource!"
9644,"A lot of information, easy to understand, good quality of lectures and interesting practical exercises! Thanks!"
9645,For JavaScript best course
9646,Very informative and entertaining course. I highly recommend it!
9647,excellent professor
9648,very structural and easy to understand!
9649,"It's a very good course to start learning HTML ,CSS and JavaScript. To get the experties suggested material is useful."
9650,Very good course. But it doesn't fit for beginners in programming. You need to have some base in HTML/CSS and programming.
9651,Really enjoyed the course.
9652,awesome like very much
9653,Great Course to learn the basics.
9654,"Excellent structure and videos are short and sweet. Assignments fit well into the lessons, although sometimes they are a little bit more challenging. But that's the point right? To challenge yourself."
9655,"It's well organized, many thanks!"
9656,Great!
9657,need more engagement and exercises before every week task 
9658,Its pretty basic but it is a good start for the entire specialization.Thank you
9659,Good course but I think it needs more Javascript materials.
9660,Nice work please keep going in the same way
9661,"This course provides load of information to get beginners started. The course content and assignments are also challenging enough for me understand the concepts. However the videos are a bit long so it's easy to get distracted. I'd recommend who take this course to take a glimpse at the assignment first, then come back and watch the videos, you'll have better focus on what you want to learn from there."
9662,the course is excellent for me to remind me with everything in html css and jsbut i guess it's not for newbies to these subjectsthere is so many points that i guess need to have prior knowledge
9663,Thank you David. It is a wonderful course. 
9664,"These exercises are not difficult, even a little easy. "
9665,Awesome Course
9666,Great course and nice assignments. The course was particularly very helpful in teaching me the new tags of HTML5.
9667,"Pretty good introduction course. Not very thorough as all starters, but nicely composed and presented. "
9668,"This was a good introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I recommend taking it simultaneously with another beginning course on the same material though because not all aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be addressed in a single course. "
9669,Good starter course.
9670,Great instructor with great presentation methods that make learning course content simple and straight forward. Would recommend to anyone needing to get web basics into their toolbox of skills.
9671,"Cool, very complete introduction"
9672,1. We didn't have any feedback.2. I couldn't review my partners because there isn't projects to review.3. Teacher never answer forums.
9673,Useful and exciting!
9674,Wonderful course !!!!
9675,excelente curso te va llevando paso a paso ojala y haya mas cursos de este tipo por parte de la universidad ya que nos ayudan a estar lo mas actualizasdos posible y sobre todo nos invitan a practicar gracias
9676,I am enjoyed your course. Good instructions!
9677,"Wonderful course! Instruction was helpful, interesting and useful. I highly recommend! "
9678,The course is easy to underst
9679,Everything is explained in very elegant way. Overall an awesome course
9680,"I enjoyed a lot the course and I think, even if it takes 3 weeks and looks short it isn't, it's very complete and teaches you the basis to grow up by yourself but at the same time to start creating :)"
9681,"An awesome course! I learned a lot of HTML, CSS and JS. "
9682,Short but nice introduction!
9683,I think your home assignments should be more difficult.
9684,"very informative and well structured course, highly recommended."
9685,straightforward and easy to understand.
9686,I am really the instructor and material.
9687,"Perfect course! Very good teacher! It help me with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Big thanks to David Rossiter!"
9688,Great course
9689,Great course for those beginning web development.
9690,"The video classes were really great, well explained, also examples were given in all topics. I recommend you doing. I think in the java Script part is best if you already have some programming background. "
9691,A great course for beginners but there was too much detail for submitting assignments.
9692,Basic level.
9693,Good course.By Rafael Rodriguez from Venezuela.
9694,Very useful course.
9695,Excellent course! Great teacher!
9696,Great instructor with useful contests. 
9697,Good overview of all three core web technologies. The price seems a bit high though if you're considering the verified certificate.
9698,"Excellent course. This course has everything you want and need. Just follow the teacher and FINISH all the assessments, you will be a full stack developer. "
9699,Is a good introduction 
9700,Excellent course but it would have been better to include some simple exercises to help with learning the javascript
9701,I had fun refreshing the basic concepts of HTML and looking at basic h=javascript programs
9702,I like this course! I agree to learn other things about web development! Thanks!!
9703,"Great course and teacher. That course covers basics of HTML, CSS and JS and would be useful for beginners "
9704,its amazing to be a part of this course learnt a lot 
9705,so useful
9706,Great Course!
9707,Excellent training!
9708,good lessons!
9709,Great introduction to the subject.
9710,"Very nice course, it's admirable how you can put all the essentials of web development in just one course."
9711,"Really liked it, Professor Rossiter was very thorough at explaining the content. Would recommend if I was starting to learn Web design/development."
9712,Great course for an intro into the client side portion of a full stack developer. Especially liked the end javascript portion and final assignment.
9713,"Prof. Rossiter is a great teacher and super funny in this IT way. I especially recommend this course to beginner digital marketers - this material, lectures and assignments really help with understanding how some tools that use html and js tags work."
9714,"Curso b??sico que avanza r??pido, como introducci??n est?? bien."
9715,A very good entry to front-end web design
9716,Good introduction to the big three web languages that are a prerequisite to web programming.
9717,Good course! Thanks!
9718,buen curso
9719,I learned a lot :D! i can wait to learn more!
9720,"Muy buen curso, el instructor es una persona que sabe explicar muy bien, los ejercicios son muy buenos y entiendes muy bien el tema. Adem??s las tareas ayudaron mucho a entender los conceptos vistos. Daban buenos apuntes y ejemplos con los que te puedes ir guiando a lo largo del curso, sin duda muy recomendable."
9721,"Good mooc. Clearly and dynamic. I learned to much, thanks to make this mooc!"
9722,Good starting point for we design 
9723,I really learnt a lot! Lectures are thorough and go in depth into the topics. After this course you cannot call yourself a developer yet but you'll be on the way to become a good one! :)
9724,Very good course for greenhand!
9725,Excellent course. Clear explanations for all concepts given with a bit of humour.
9726,I have learned a lot in a short time. I would recommend.
9727,"It is an excellent course, I am enjoided"
9728,The teacher is very clear. The lessons are not too long and the learner can go is own speed.
9729,"Really nice course, it's not very difficult, but still very useful. David Rossiter is very talented teacher. His explanations are clear and concise. The best course I've ever seen here at coursera."
9730,This is a magnificent introduction
9731,Very balanced and well-paced course
9732,Great Basics and hands on assignments to get to know a bit about html and css and play around with javascript
9733,"It's an amazing introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript! I had a lot of fun completing all the assessment tasks given."
9734,Excellent CourseThank you !!!
9735,"Nice teacher, easy to follow with a small background in programming. Very satisfied with this course! Definetly will take another course from this university!"
9736,Super useful for non-coders and to revive some useful assets to experienced ones! ;)
9737,Basic with some level of advance Course for Web Dev
9738,Excellent tutorial for beginners!!
9739,"good instructor and well organized course, thank you "
9740,I really learnt a lot through this course. Hoping to do full stack specialization :)
9741,"Excellent to get a general knowledge of the three technologies. Would have been ideal to allocate two more weeks to expand the lessons related to HTML+CSS and the lessons on JavaScript.Kudos for David Rossiter. Clear, eloquent and helpful."
9742,"An excellent course to start. If you know something about web development is not enough for you, but you want to start from scratch this is definitely your course."
9743,I loved this course. The only thing that could have made this better was more days for the deadlines. 
9744,"Basic and easy HTML, CSS and Javascript course. More specializated on Javascript than the other two."
9745,"Effective study course for HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript."
9746,Brilliant content!
9747,"Good course, with useful examples and methodology!"
9748,Great start for students seeking Web development
9749,Very informative and easy to understand
9750,"Originally, I rated this course 3-stars. However, I have since decided it is worth 1-star after taking the next course in the series, Bootstrap. I thought that there wasn't enough time to cover all the material to make this course good. After taking the next course, I see that it is possible to deliver a lot of material and concepts in short order. However, it takes thinking, planning, and dedication. I think this course is TERRIBLE and seriously needs an overhaul. After taking this course, you barely know any CSS and despite passing assignments that don't challenge, you're probably worse off than a student who fails in school. The course suffers from the extremely short timeframe. Covering one of each of the three core topics a week is just insufficient to provide any sort of depth to this course. While there are supplementary readings, Coursera and the participating institutions need to understand that there are those who are taking courses to get more than a one page Wiki style coverage of a topic."
9751,Very good teacher ! Clear and short lessons and very usefull exercices. Thank you
9752,The course covers basics very well.
9753,I like the course
9754,detailed introduction but I feel sometimes the topic can be a little bit deeper.
9755,Excelent course. Very clear and well structured.
9756,Good for beginners.
9757,"I do not usually review any classes such as this let alone in the beginning of the course. Regardless this course in my opinion is how programming should be taught. You have the video course, documentation and application. I will continue to use this course to build on what I have and will learn. I can not say any more than keep up the excellent work sir! "
9758,"Very good course, very appreciate the teacher's affords. He using very understandable English to give us each presentation, thank you!"
9759,Excellent
9760,The teacher is great
9761,Great course!
9762,"This course helped expand on my JavaScript knowledge, particularly concerning DOM structure. However, if I had been a beginner in any of these topics, I'm not sure if this course would have been enough. Not much time is spent on clarifying HTML and CSS, i.e., there were a lot of topics untouched. Additionally, while the instructor's videos were excellent, the professor did not participate in course discussions at all. I think there were many times when he should have been available to lend a helping/clarifying hand."
9763,excellent loved it....David sir is truly an awesome teacher! :D
9764,Really Amazing.........
9765,Really good for the ones who just started also the ones need to refresh their mind.
9766,Good introduction with practice.
9767,can be more interesting :)
9768,good for start 
9769,"There are many free courses on the internet focused on HTMl, CSS and Javascript, some of them good, some of them not so good... This one... is PERFECT!!"
9770,"Loved the course, only draw back is that students are marking assignments."
9771,"This course is great! It is more advanced than other intro courses, and gives you a solid foundation."
9772,really nice course as an introduction to css and javascript
9773,Good course and contain a lot of important materials. 
9774,Very good and easily explained concepts with useful examples. Recommended for newbies as well as experienced programmers for a quick refresh
9775,It's a very nice and easily understandable basic course.
9776,You did a great course! Thanks for shared knwolege and skills!
9777, David Rossiter the BEST teacher. You helps me very much!!! Thank you very much! 
9778,"this course was good for me.prior to this course i have no idea of html,css,javascript.explanation was good.."
9779,well taught and easily understood
9780,"I am totally new in this new HTML language, CSS and Java Script. I like the quality of the information provided in the videos. For a new student like me this is really useful but still, I am not able to cope with the speed of the course. But still, the information is good and I am going to continue until the end. Thanks!"
9781,more excercises should be added to the course 
9782,"Exercises could have been tougher so that we could reinforce learning material and also try to learn how to search the web to find the solution to a bug.Before a month, all I knew was Javascript was tough.Thanks for making me feel confident programming in Javascript.Thank You."
9783,Easy to understand and follow. Highly recommended for beginners with no experience about any of these subjects. Practical assignments at the end of every week help me to remember and actually use what I have learnt during the course
9784,a good intro course for people don't have experience on these topics. 
9785,"Thank you so much for this course! The materials presented were great, very concise and yet provided sufficient information. I have already recommended your course to many other people. Many thanks once again!"
9786,"Very good lessons!!! I learned a lot of new things, specially JavaScript."
9787,"Good starting point. If you know the three languages this course could be basic, but (as lot of dev are) if you lack JS knowledge it's a good starting point too!"
9788,"Great course! I've learned a lot and it was fun. Might not be suitable for total beginners, though."
9789,Thank you for the oportunity to learn about HTML CSS and JavaScript.I wish you all the best!!!
9790,Good teaching!
9791,"Great set of lessons, covers the specifics and important main things of each of the topics.But I must say that several time the evaluation is a little too hard given the content of the course (talking about quis and projects) and that also is a lot of ground to cover."
9792,Really helpful for learner and to begin the journey in HTML... :)
9793,Very good explanation by professor.
9794,Very clear and descriptive videos.Great and fun assignments.
9795,very good material for beginners 
9796,very good cource
9797,good
9798,GREAT!
9799,"Great introductory course. Even though I am an experienced developer, I don't have too much Javascript experience and I learned a few new things. The material was presented in a very clear and concise manner."
9800,"Great course. Very clear explanation of HTML, CSS and Javascript concepts."
9801,One of the better courses on Coursera! Well done and thank you for sharing knowledge.But we need more of David and his teachingskills!!! MORE!
9802,"Hello David Rossiter,Thank you very much for this course. It was clear, simple and precise.RegardsAravind"
9803,great
9804,Best course I have taken so far on Coursera - great professor
9805,many many good informathion
9806,Balanced
9807,Very lovely beginners course.
9808,Absolutely excellent
9809,It's so good!
9810,I found it very useful. Good introduction to web development :)
9811,"the html,css,js course is one of the best courses I ever enrolled in and I strongly recommend it to everyone "
9812,"Wonderful course, Really enjoy the teaching philosophy and structure to the lessons. Thank you and great job! "
9813,"Good basic introduction of HTML and Javascript, challenging assignments. Thanks to Dave Rossiter and all the course team for interesting learning!"
9814,awesome
9815,This course guides learners of various proficiency very well. Dave was very thorough and methodical in his approach. Assignments are of moderate competency to complete with out any difficulties. 
9816,Very good!
9817,The course was very descriptive and yet did not feel like overburdening. The material was laid out in a very organized manner with meaningful assignments. Cheers! 
9818,"very good for beginners and intermediate programmers to review the concept of HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics! "
9819,"Sir,I really salute you for your organized way of teaching. It is really helpful to understand concepts as well as to do the assignments.Thanks Yours faithfully,Kiran Kumar.M"
9820,Well explained course and good for the beginners.
9821,A very good course that explain all you need in these 3 languages
9822,"I love the way the presentations are set up. It's clear and obvious what the material is about and I know exactly what I'm about to learn so when I go back and need a reference I can easily select the module and figure out if it's what I need or not. The assignments make good use of the concepts we learned in the lectures. Very good course, yet also challenging to complete some of the tasks. I recommended a friend to join me in successive courses in this specialization."
9823,This is an excellent course. Thank you! 
9824,I improve my skills from novice to professional.Now I have a solid understanding of how these three technologies work together.
9825,That's awesome !!!
9826,Simple and clear!
9827,"Some of the videos are a bit too slow phased, but all in all it is a really good introductory course to HTML, CSS and Javascript. Would like to see a part two for each subject with some more in dept coverage of the subjects."
9828,"Very good course, I learn a lot"
9829,"Excellent explanations, superb presentations and challenging assignments. Kudos to everyone who put their efforts and specially to Dr. David Rossiter"
9830,"really nice , i learn a lot of the basics of html "
9831,It's astonishing!!!
9832,Nice introduction to the subject. Teacher and presentations were easy to understand and not too dry. Homework assignments were interesting and peer reviewing other people's submissions helped get pointers on what I could've done better.
9833,Great course!
9834,"This is a very good introductive course. It's easy to follow, it's explicative and offers extra resources to complement the contents and deep."
9835,"Basic web course and very well detailed. I could review basic concepts of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript to continue in the specialisation series."
9836,One of the best courses i have attended on coursera. very clear and educative. Thank you!
9837,"Overall it's a good intro if you know nothing or very little about those topics.That said, the class is too slow.Homework is too easy and boring. It's all about following very specific (long) instructions - put this line of JS here, create a function called Foo, etc.Grading is done by peers, even though it could be automated. Participation requires running arbitrary JS written by other students."
9838,"Great course! And the professor is one of the best I've ever seen, he is very attentive and very didactic."
9839,"A very good course with a great instructor, it covers so much stuff and it's pretty well explained. Recommended!"
9840,Grate course for intermediate level programmers like me. Helps clear up all knowlege
9841,"Is a great introduction to html, css and javascript. The professor explain all things very very well."
9842,This was very interesting course. I enjoyed it thoroughly. The projects at the end of every week are really good and makes you explore the subject and the language. The lectures were good too.
9843,That was really exciting :) And the assignments were interesting and giving a deeper understanding of the material
9844,amazing course for beginners with a little bit of common sense.
9845,"Great material, not too in depth but if you know some programming then you will at least be able to properly read code now and know what to google, which I think is the most important for learning a new programming language."
9846,"Structured Course that gives beginner to intermediate level expertise. Short course, so there is not much time to give challenging assignments that would prepare you for a job or industry level skill in this topic. The student enrollment was limited (compared to my other courses on Coursera) and hence the discussion forum was not active. There is no TA or instructor participation in discussion forum; hence my advanced questions in forum (intended to learn beyond the course) went unanswered. You can learn this all on internet, but the instructor nicely covered 3 topics in 3 weeks, which is helpful."
9847,I like this course and did not learnt this before. The professor taught very well and clear. I can understand and learnt very well. 
9848,Very good basic explanation. Expecting some more in-depth hard topics to be covered. 
9849,"Course was what I expected. I'm a software engineer, so the work wasn't terribly difficult. I did find it a decent academic intro to the subject matter. "
9850,"Clear materials, good examples, good pace, well thought through assignments.Prof did a great job!Thank you."
9851,You can learn a lot and practise ;)
9852,Good Quick Ad contains sufficient topics for a beginner.
9853,a well organized and paced course.
9854,"Easy to follow and comprehensive video lectures, challenging tasks to implement and re-consider all the information given - I really enjoyed this course and I'm going on with the next one."
9855,"The class has a lot of good information but I felt as though it was a bit disorganized. There were way too many people taking the class but not enough to grade the assignments. On the plus side I was able to switch to another session of the class while keeping all of my progress so hopefully my assignments will get graded this time around and I'll be able to complete the class. If an auto-grader or a way to ensure that everybody who turns in assignments will get those assignments graded back quickly could be implemented this would be a stellar class. Despite it's faults though I would still recommend it as I did learn a fair amount of HTML, CSS and JS quickly. I look forward to additional classes from this university. Thank you for your efforts. "
9856,Pretty useful especially with the codebase as examples.
9857,Simply Excellent !
9858,"Excellent course, good teacher, good lessons, a lot of new things!"
9859,"Very well presented. Clear explanations, but not dumbed down. This 3 week course obviously won't teach you everything you need to know about front-end development, but if you want a good start in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this is the course to take."
9860,Awesome
9861,"Plus: Lots of information for a beginner course, covers a lot of ground in HTML/CSS/JS. Some applications requiring building web-pages and JS programs to get hands-on experienceNegative: HTML/CSS and to a less extent JS introduced pretty much as a list of disconnected tags/attributes etc, leaves some confusion as to how it all fits together, but that probably can't be avoided when covering a lot of ground in a short 3 weeks beginner course"
9862,"Nice basics and intro into javascript, css and HTML5"
9863,"Very nice course, with kinda challenging (for beginners, of course), but not really hard tasks. Don't expect it to teach you everything, though, it's only the basics."
9864,Very useful and interesting first week of the course also good exmplanation.
9865,Good introduction course.
9866,This was a great course that taught the basics of web development. The professor explained the concepts really well and in an easy-to-understand way.
9867,After watching the videos of this course I feel I am ready to analyse and understand almost any client-side HTML+CSS+JS code.I would recommend this course to a friend. 
9868,Like it a lot. Very useful.
9869,Very good course! ;)
9870,I only took the JavaScript course so here it goes -AWESOME....simple and very well put. I am completely satisfied.....thanks a lot HKST
9871,I really liked the way it was taught. I could skip through the areas I was competent. Helped me fill the gaps. I strongly recommend this course. 
9872,I think this is the best course for everybody who wants to learn basics about web development. These assignments are interesting and help the student more understanding your the knowledge.
9873,"No complaints at all, excellent course in every aspect."
9874,"Excellent introduction, with very apt assignments."
9875,Very good course
9876,Great course!
9877,"Great course for refreshing HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts."
9878,This is a very good course; got me started on the path of web development. The lessons and explanation were very good and clear. Thanks.
9879,The grading is kinda problematic because you can just grade with 1 or 0 nothing in between. Also for the assignments it is hard sometimes to figure out how to solve the problems and external materials are needed.The professor is really good though and so are the lectures!!!!
9880,Loved it
9881,A good basic introduction to the subjects and interesting practical assignments.
9882,"Amazing course , very easy to understand with great explain . Thumb up"
9883,Great introduction into the subject!
9884,"I like a lot the final assignment, it was simple but entertainment. Of course, this was pretty basic stuff but is an introduction, it??s good anyway. The teacher is great so I have not complaints with this course.Good to know that you can??t master CSS, HTML and javascript just by watching some videos so is necessary to practice and read additional resources.Thanks a lot for the course, I??m looking forward to take other courses with teacher David here in courser."
9885,"i really like this course.and all lectures were very helpful,all were so understandable.thankyou so much."
9886,Best beginner course towards advanced courses. Achievable and easy for starter assignments. 
9887,Good course
9888,Excellent course but it moves very fast! Stay caught up with the work and you will do good!
9889,Excellent Course not just for beginners! You should have little programming experience before. Learnt a lot about DOM in javascript which helped me in my current job.
9890,"Pros:A basic introduction to the 3 core front-end technologies. The Professor has structured the course in a logical and easy to follow progressive format. The presentations are professionally done with quality audio and HD video. (The Professor speaks with a clear proper British accent). If watching online, there are helpful short quizzes built into the videos to make sure people are not skipping ahead. (Not sure if these 'video quizzes are graded, but I think they are helpful) Cons:The projects are helpful to reinforce logic and programming concepts, however, they are not real world and may be too simple to be of real value. One will need supplemental resources to fill in the gaps for the projects. I would have liked a real world example, even if it was beyond the scope of the course."
9891,Great course. Looking forward to start other courses from whole specialization. Fantastic work.
9892,Very good
9893,"This is THE BEST course I have ever taken on coursera or else. Very simple but effective, complex things are made bit simple to learn. Just in 3 weeks, covered a good contents. Specially the way of teaching was bit simple but outstanding. Pleasure to be a part of this course"
9894,It could ask more of the student. The assigments was read and do.
9895,"Great Course! The lecturer explains in accessible language the new material.He explained in detail examples of tasks. Very interesting control tasks.I really liked it!If you have no experience with Javascript, Welcome, and you will have a good basis for the continuation of the study of the language!"
9896,Awesome course
9897,nice explanation
9898,"This is perfect for learners who want to study basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, java script. Professor accent and speaking speed are easy to be understood."
9899,"Great explanation showing a lot of details, the assignments were very well explained and helped a lot in learning.If the videos were shorter in time it would be better."
9900,"great course, well prepared assignment, the best one I have came across on that subject."
9901,Enjoyed the course and learned a lot within short three weeks. Assignments that are peer-reviewed really help with learning and seeing different ways to tackling same problems.
9902,"Really great lectures. The assignments are also complicated enough that you put in practice what you learned, but not so that you are frustrated with them."
9903,Great course!
9904,good introduction course
9905,Nice
9906,Primera semana completada y ya puedo decir que el curso esta muy bien estructurado.Espero las semanas siguientes sigan teniendo la misma calidad de contenido. 
9907,important and very interesting. 
9908,"Good Videos, Very helpful, easy to understand. Great value course."
9909,excellent introductory course
9910,A good level of detail for newcomers to web technologies. The assignments are good but I would say too easy in that most of the work in figuring out what to do is actually done for you in the outline of what to submit.
9911,Nice course material. The assignments are interesting and fun to work on. Looking forward to more such courses ! 
9912,Great course filled with very useful information. Thank you
9913,Nice Teaching . Provides good examples and also explains them well
9914,Great for beginners
9915,The course is very complete. The lecturer explains very well. He presents the contents in a nice way and he always give good examples to accomplish the subjects.I definitely recommend this course!

9917,Excellent! A good introduction to frontend development :-)
9918,Really good course to learn HTML CSS and JS
9919,"Great introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I learned a lot and hope to learn more advanced topics in the future. Highly recommended."
9920,Great course! I learned a lot and am looking forward to the other coursesthank you very much
9921,this course is very helpful for to me to understand html css and java cript
9922,Incredible course
9923,"This course is for the absolute beginner who has never heard of programming before, yet it makes an easy slide into web development for experienced software developer as well. The professor is simply awesome, lectures are perfectly organized (although a bit lengthy more than needed sometimes) and assignments are totally on point for beginners as well. I wish it was a bit more complicated and challenging, but for the targeted level, I guess it was ok."
9924,Very good explanation.
9925,"&lt;p&gt;Pretty clear demonstration, but everything taught here is too simple.&lt;/p&gt;"
9926,Helpful also for experienced HTML students
9927,Excellent instructor and excellent information and great courses in the specialization. The instructor is extremely good
9928,great place to learn
9929,Very good lecturer! Thank you very much.
9930,"I like this approach. It gives you the hunger for more JavaScript after you have completed the course. Very good intro course, it covered a lot. "
9931,"Is excellent, however I hoped to learn more."
9932,"The best teacher ever! I really like this course. Everything is good, every week."
9933,I really liked how concisely and precisely the concepts were introduced in this course.
9934,Excellent
9935,very good
9936,Great introductory course. It gave me a solid foundation to continue my self-learning in this domain. The videos are very clear well narrated and nicely paced.
9937,"I learned a lot from the course and I had fun doing the projects. Although, the projects could be tougher and more involved."
9938,Excellent teacher and very good course 
9939,Thanks a lot to the Course Team for their efforts and making this course available
9940,"Course flow goes smoothly. Exercises are good. In starting I felt reviewing classmate assignment task boring, but later on realized it is very helpful and we can get idea of different logic and thinking process. Overall good experience."
9941,Need to explain more topics
9942,at moment excelent
9943,"It's the best video tutorial on html ,CSS &amp; JavaScript I ever found. Really helped a lot to beginners like me toweb development."
9944,It??s ideal for beginners. The teacher explain every thing very clear.
9945,good!
9946,Lectures were intuitive. The way assignments were designed is the best
9947,Very good content and very well taught.
9948,Material is great while separating assignment to several parts in confusing for me personally - I don't see why we need first parts when the resulting project contains all from the previous parts. This separation is justified in my mind for big projects - and these assignments weren't that big.
9949,good tutorial
9950,GREAT! 
9951,Perfect course!
9952,"Great course, even though sometimes there are difficulties to log in"
9953,"That's couse is amazzing, because I'd knew something but I'm being more stange my knowledge"
9954,"Good Course, definitely worth "
9955,Very clear !
9956,Great! ;)
9957,This is the best web development course i have enrolled with.It enables a thorough understanding on the fundamentals which are the root of progressive education.
9958,Excellent
9959,great course i always want to lean
9960,"Hi,I got promoted as a beta tester only 4 days ago, which was too short to review the whole course. So, here's my review for the first two weeks.The course is nice and easy to follow. It looks like beginner level. However, since it seems aimed at beginners, I think the teacher should put more emphasis on- good practices (i.e. when there are several ways to do something, always indicate which one is recommended).- accessibility for people with disabilities, which should be a priority when creating new websiteAlso, I think that 3 weeks is a bit too short. The first week should at least be split in two so that students get more time to practice HTML/CSS coding.Lastly, there should be many more practice quizzes and (why not?) optional projects.Thank you for having me as a beta tester."
9961," It is so much clear to understand the lessons,even your english is not good. Thank to all people who gives us their precious time to teach. "
9962,"Excellent course my friends, teaches the basics of what you need to know to use HTML,CSS,Javascript and then it expands on it just enough so you know whats coming, its a beautifully well crafted course and the starter of a complete program made by Coursera to learn how to be a web developer, i personally recommend this course in its entirety."
9963,Good course!
9964,"Nice course to refresh the basic's, you will defiantly learn something new "
9965,"Very, very good course! Many useful things were explained thoroughly!!! Thank you David Rossiter! Good luck with what you do!"
9966,"What I found interesting in this course was the fact that assignments were hands-on, thus I go to actually put the things I learned into practical use, not just watch and pretend to understand."
9967,"Good introduction to web development, however I would update js part. Maybe use es6/esnext and use standard code conventions (like camel case names etc) so that students don't learn bad habits."
9968,"Good basic introduction to HTML, CSS &amp; JS. You can grasp a basics and evolve your knowledge using other resources and later courses in the full stack program. "
9969,"Great course. Short, clear lesson that inform the exercises and practice questions. Learned a lot despite already knowing a fair amount about HTML and CSS. Enjoyed the projects!"
9970,"Love the professor, love the course, splendid job guys!"
9971,excellent course. A best place for beginners!
9972,Fantastic course!
9973,Nice and evolved course.

9975,It was a very good kick start... :)
9976,Awesome course!
9977,"A very useful course, strongly recommended!"
9978,very informative and fun course 
9979,Best course i have ever seen...Thank you coursera Now I can say myself a FrontEndDeveloper
9980,Good Course for learning Html Css and javascript
9981,"Excellent Course, easy to understand and follow."
9982,Great course!
9983,"It's very basic, but definitely worth to cath up some details and basics"
9984,Great course for beginner. Its explain detail on DOM concept with javascript core. HTML and CSS are good too.
9985,"Enjoyed the course a lot, definitely worth taking it. There is of course a lot out there to learn about these topics that will not be covered BUT if you are a beginner like myself want to have your coding up and going and ignite your interest, this is the course for you."
9986,Great course for beginners at Javascript!!
9987,Course instruction is consistent and thorough. I wold like more ideas for programs to build for personal practice other than the three assignments.
9988,Good course. Nice mix of assignments. Very practical information with right amount of theory. 
9989,Nice lessons and excellent assignments

9994,great!
9995,Excellent course 
9996,"Excelent!Grate introduction to Html,Css,and Java script .yes this project is very hard challenging but hard workingis big Success!"
9997,"The actual assignments hold your hand too much for this class. A student could get a lot more out of this time with more challenging and better thought out assignments. An effective introduction, but an ineffectual of creating substantial and useable knowledge."
9998,Excelent!
9999,"Great introduction to html, css, and javascript. The projects were challenging, but achievable with a bit of elbow grease."
10000,Very Good course for beginner
10001,Great Course to jump into web programming!
10002,Awesome course! I'm an IT professional and always wanted to find an easier way to get in intros and basics of webdevelopment. This course gave me all that while building a solid foundation for the other to come. :)

10016,good
10017,The course was comprehensive
10018,Nice course
10019,VERY GOOD
10020,Very Interesting Course; The pedagogic approach is innovative
10021,simply best for beginners!
10022,Some more information regarding the HTML attributes like area controls would have been good. 
10023,This was a great class. The professor did a great job breaking down concepts with concrete examples and assignments. 
10024,Very useful
10025,Best course!!!
10026,It was great! A great start.
10027,The course is full of fun. I like the interesting assignment and I learned a lot from doing by myself and reviewing other students' work. I also got feedback from my classmates which helped me a lot.
10028,"Un curso muy bueno, muchas gracias!!"
10029,The course content is very backward and needs to be updated though the quiz and project parts were very good and I enjoyed completing the course. 
10030,Javascript course content can be increased
10031,Very helpful and awesome.!!
10032,The great course!
10033,The course is very informative. The topics discussed are precise and the tutor was very nice to help us understand the concepts easily.
10034,Excellent course
10035,This is probably the best thing that I have decided to do in the last 10 years. Coming across Coursera and the offered University courses is a great thing to enhance your abilities for finding new opportunities out there. I'm looking forward to successful completion of the rest of the courses as well. Thank you for the great opportunity again Vancho
10036,"I love this course! Firstly, professor's accent is so clear and I can understand 100% what he is talking. Additionally, I like the short video per point - which keeps me concentrate within a few minutes. It is a kind of very efficient instruction design. Last but not least, the assignment design is great, not too hard nor too much. I can practice what I have learnt and what I need to know in doing these assignments. In a word, professor demonstrated fairly high teaching capability and left me a very good impression of HKUST. I would highly recommend this course to my friends who are interested in learning web technologies! "
10037,Nice course! Easy to understand and practice
10038,"Good course and congratulations to Professor David.I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about html, css and js."
10039,"Very progressive and efficient learning. Each week's assessment gives enough challenge to be able to make progress, while being fun and interesting."
10040,"Very nice intro course for learning the basics of web programming, thank you to Dr. Rossiter and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for making this course available to students worldwide."
10041,This course is really good. I enjoyed this course a lot.
10042,A good course for a beginner level.

10044,"Just got my certificate today, One of the best course out there to start from basic. little bit fast hence have to read lots of resources from other media like W3school.com. other then that its the best course to start with in web development."

10046, The course gave good basic knowledge of html and javascript 
10047,great
10048,"Excellent course and I really enjoyed the learning process I had been guiding through these weeks. This is a great entry level course for people like me who have few knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The professor went through each concepts explicitly. Some concepts in JavaScript can be tricky for students without a CS background, but this course really makes things easier to understand. There are some small challenging in assignments, but it's still a great opportunity to transform all those concepts to my knowledge and experiences. "

10062,Good to learn
10063,A great course. I've learned a lot from it.
10064,Very in depth and detailed course!
10065,I took the course to update myself on HTML5 and get the fundamentals of JS. I think for people with no development experience can be a little bit confusing as some of the concepts are explained very superficial.
10066,Excellent course. The teacher is very thorough and explains in details.
10067,Nice course. Helped me learn a lot.
10068,Very good! I will continue my lessons!

10090,I love this course. The advisor explain everything clearly and the knowledge is very helpful.
10091,Excellent course!
10092,"The course is excellently taught by David and I learned a lot. Worth doing as a pre-cursor to any other, longer web design course you might be considering as it gives you the basics. My advice would be to take time with the lectures, download a html text editor and pause frequently to check the code yourself and make sure it works. It moves quickly, but there's a lot to be learned from pausing and trying it yourself. "
10093,"The HTML, CSS and JavaScript course was well structured, challenging and interesting. The professor was excellent and I thank him and all the staff for a great course."

10126,"Not really a beginner course. I had to complement this course with other JS open source courses only to realise JS is really huge. Additionally, the course requires prior knowledge about HTML and CSS as well and it does not seem to be up to date with newest language versions such as HTML5 and CSS3"
10127,great teacher

10129,"Tr??s bon cours pour html, css et surtout javascript"

10144,"Good pace, and just the right level of guidance for some interesting assignments."
10145,I would have liked the course to have more step by step lectures that would allow us to follow the same structure when going through our assignments. Maybe even explain the assignment in the start then apply each lecture to show how each step is done within the assignment. I had to resort to third party sites and found that alot of the assignments have been uploaded online already.
10146,This is the best course ever!! So much fun and learning!! 
10147,This course gave me a nice start. Totally recommend if you're a beginner. Content was not overwhelming and tasks were a real challenge for me
10148,I thoroughly enjoyed the course.Learning technical was never so much interesting at least to me.Thank you Professor Muppala and Coursera. 
10149,I highly recommend this course. Assignments are practical and interesting.

10169,"good, i like this course"
10170,"Good course to understand the basic of javascript, CSS and HTML,"
10171,Great course for beginner.

10173,Excellent course with very insightful lessons and assignments.
10174,"This is a intermediate course w/o elaborate details on all the syntax of HTM and CSS. It gives you the big picture of how JavaScript, HTML and CSS interactive with each other."

10176,great intro for js and front end newbies

10196,"I loved this course so much, it helps me a lot to gain a good knowledge for terms like CSS, HTML, JS.the assessment were very helpful to practice what was illustrated in the lectures, at the end of this course you will know what really CSS and JS means and how they act to modify and improve html content"

Espa??ol: Excelente curso para quienes deseen aprender HTML, CSS y Javascript desde cero o para quienes, como yo, ya tengan un conocimiento b??sico pero deseen actualizarlo o refrescarlo un poco a base de pr??ctica. "
10199,"Se aprende mucho, recomendable, los temas son cubiertos con suficiente profundidad, y los ejercicios estan bien dise??ados. "

10249,thanks .................................................................
10250,Courses can be a bit more detailed.
10251,good
10252,Too basic and not thorough enough. The assignments are too easy also because of over specific assignments instructions.
10253,VERY GOOD 
10254,I recommend it. 
10255,Great professor and great head start into Full Stack development. I was sad to see it end after only 3 short weeks.

10263,nice and simple for beginners 
10264,Course had a good content and the exercises were able to make the use of the elements
10265,One of the best course out there for web developers
10266,"I loved it.This course only touches the surface of what's HTML, CSS and JS and will by no means make you an expert. However, it is a good starting point."
10267,Great course! Clear instruction and easy to follow!
10268,Excelente. Se aprende mucho. Keep it up!
10269,"Really good course, gives you the basics you need to further study about Web Development"
10270,Great course!
10271,"Wonderfull tips and content to introduce in the HTML, CSS, Javascript"
10272,I really like the way the instructor gives clear explanations and also the assignment added each week.
10273,That's really a good way to start on web developing major!
10274,Great course!
10275,The course is very interesting for junior -wannabe- web programmers. It uses the main structures of HTML and JavaScript and lets the user exercise through questions and assignments. Best option if someone wants to be a web developer!
10276,"A great class for anyone interested in learning the essentials of html, css, and javascript in relatively short order."
10277,It's awesome! But It is very very general!
10278,Good way to get hands on experience. While it is challenging to get a quesiton answer - as there is a lot of searching on the forums (rather than having 1-1 or life q&amp;a)
10279,Fantastic Course. I feel confident with the exercises and information provided!
10280,"Very nice and the presentations are very clear and understandable, It's a very basic course of web development which is why I think it's a little bit expensive for this level of course. "

10283,Really good course on HTML5/CSS/JavaScript. Enough resources and practices exercises.
10284,"Fun to follow, light hearted, but with substantial content, that will help you web development career."
10285,"It is pretty an interesting course, especially the practical tasks, but, after all, it is much better for those who already knows the technologies mentioned in the title. The information is given very quickly during the lectures, so it may be not so useful for web development beginners (even regarding possible background in other areas of software development). That is why I recommend that course for those who is looking for a good HTML, CSS, and JS revision, not introduction."
10286,Excellent Instructor - David Rossiter.Thank you so much.
10287,Very helpful
10288,A great course that covers nice topics.
10289,A little bit of more information on the course couldn.'t hurt it!
10290,Excellent course.
10291,This course is a nice introduction to web development.
10292,Great course!
10293,It Was very successful to me 
10294,Easy to understand and faster to learn
10295,great course and instructor.
10296,"Excellent course! Very well thought out and introduced step by step. I'm on the third course in the series. This lays a great foundation. The assignments are great at taking previous exercise code and tailoring to new forms. It take a little extra effort and research, but will make you a better programmer."
10297,It is good to put your hands on the javascript when everyone else is using libraries and forgetting the basics. It is nice create the Matching Game. Good course.
10298,"It teaches you the basics of html css and javascript. For a starter course in spec. it is ok. I expected a little more from this course, but all in all it was good."
10299,"This course helps in understanding the basic and overall concepts in HTML, CSS and JavaScripts"
10300,It is too easy.
10301," I wouldn't never recommend this course. The teacher gives you all inforation without normal explan. You have chanse to understand HTML and CSS, but Js . JS leguage need more deteils, exemples and explaining, who I didn't find in this course. The first course is a basis for late courses and so weak teacher. I took the next series of course coz I saw that there are other tacher"
10302,"This course is way too basic, so basic it doesn't even cover some of the essential basics, like explaining what the Box Model is in CSS. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because you can still learn SOMETHING with it if you are a complete newbie, but it is very far to be reliable if you are aiming to be a professional. There is a long road to go after you finish this course, which makes me think the certificate is almost pointless and worthless.It also uses things that are generally considered a bad practice (like using DOM event attributes in the HTML). It is okay to present that to the students, but you should also mention that while they are there, it is usually not recommended to use them and explain what would be the recommended practice.I have taken courses from other sites like Codeschools, Codecademy and Treehouse and left Coursera for later because I believed that getting a certificate would require me to have some expertise, but so far I feel kind of disappointed with the Full Stack package.I am hoping it will get better with the next modules."
10303,Everything is very good explain it.
10304,Great material with excellent assignments.
10305,Good basic knowledge to proceed with small projects and to continue the education
10306,"Interesting course, It can give you a challenge. As a person who is used to programming but knows nothing about OOP, the programs was reasonable difficult. Thanks David Rossiter."
10307,Very good introductory course.
10308,"Excellent Course and Instructor, very detail, it exceeded my expectations, "
10309,I was searching for this type of lectures in different places...It is awesome one.
10310,nice course
10311,The course is very good.
10312,"Un curso muy f??cil de seguir, a pesar de su dificultad, debido a las buenas explicaciones del profesor y al seguimiento a trav??s de un s??lo proyecto para todo el curso que te ayuda a comprender todo mejor en su globalidad. 100% recomendable!"
10313,"The content was too basic, but good"
10314,Bestest Video tutorial i ever had
10315,Great! Thank you
10316,Excellent course.
10317,"Seemed very basic at the beginning and then got a lot more involved in the last week. I felt there was a lot of code samples to be pulled from, almost so much so that you barely needed to write javascript. More like copy and paste. Class was really easy. I did learn about some major topics of the DOM structure of HTML, so that was great."
10318,"Great course, would have been even better if the assignments were a bit more challenging, with less or no code snippets at all, but all in all, great experience.A big thank you to the instructor and all the mentors."
10319,excelent
10320,"Extremely well planned course and course material. You won't find any course better than this. If you know a bit of programming and want to learn more about web development, this course is for you! "
10321,Very easily understandable and modulated in the best way possible !!
10322,Great course! Right level of complexity for people who have knowledge of programming.
10323,"This is a great, quick introduction to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Professor makes full use of the three weeks (no time wasted in lectures), but it's still a basic introduction."
10324,Course nicely organized and very clear to follow. Learned a lot!
10325," Really useful! Well-explained and well-organized, affordable price. It helped me a lot for my job! Really worth it, I suggest it to every beginner who wants to know the bases and also some advanced features of html, css and javascript.. "
10326,"Good course, worth the money"
10327,Good to learn the basics of web development 
10328,"Great, I find it very useful."
10329,very good module comprising great explanations. every starter should take this. I'am happy. 
10330,Really good
10331,Great course!
10332,Reasonable contents. Focus on very useful knowledge. Perfect for beginners.
10333,"Looks good, but the assignment a bit simple."
10334,Perfect course
10335,Good basic foundation of HTML and CSS. It will help if the grading rubric needs to be more flexible in order to assess smaller outcomes. I found it too binary to be of use for accurate assessment. 
10336,"I like the course and professor.However, i think that examples could be a bit more interesting."
10337,Well Designed!
10338,I'll absolutely recommend this to anyone willing to learn.

10340,Thank you. Excelent material.
10341,I like the way the course was designed. It was easy to follow and understand each lesson.
10342,Muy buen curso
10343,Best introductory level course
10344,Very well explaination.
10345,"Awesome sir, awesome lectures and the best part awesome assignments..:)"
10346,Great introduction and materials
10347,Excellent course to start with ! It was a pleasure doing all the assignments and watching all lectures.
10348,Great course!
10349,Great class with good explanations! 
10350,Excellent education!
10351,Excellent.
10352,"Easy, clear material. Didactive teacher."
10353,Excellent!
10354,"Great! Some key information was omitted assuming student knew some key concepts, I had to cross reference on the internet to back fill. Otherwise good. "
10355,"This was a very nice introduction to the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript."
10356,Great course helped me understand the basics very well. I wish responsive techniques and chrome developers tools were talked about a bit.
10357,Awesome training. Loved it!
10358,great!
10359,Very good course.. Very crisp presentation. 
10360,Learned a lot from the course. Really beneficial. Loses a star due to having to mark other people's work - really time consuming! 
10361,The instructor is really awesome and he explains each and every concept mention in the course outline really well. The course is very helpful for the beginners. There is lot of things in this course that would increase your learning experience.
10362,Great Course!
10363,"This course has given me a general approach should be used as javascript, and helped me implement solutions without the need for utilzar framewors javascript. "
10364,Excellent intro... Thank-you
10365,Excellent course and assignments and great presentation by David Rossiter.
10366,"Professor is really goooood! He explains the material from the slides, just as if you were in an actual class, i.e. he doesn't read from some screen. Assignments are challenging but easy at the same time because you submit the full versions in incremental steps. Good learning experience. However, I feel the course is a bit expensive for a three week period."
10367,Great assignments and bad videos.
10368,It is a nice course. Covered the basics with step by step instructions and examples.
10369,"If you want to be a web developer and have no knowledge of html and css then you can start from this for sure, the basics are cleared in a very good way and the exercises are hard enough to ue your brain for the exercises."
10370,Super course!! Nice explanatory videos and challenging assignments.
10371,I look forward to more of your classes!
10372,"Great course for brushing up on basic web design, but doesn't really provide any more information than what W3Schools already has on their site. Don't expect a deep dive into JS -- it's just enough to give you some ideas on how to manipulate elements within your website."
10373,great course!!
10374,Well explained and very organized. Concepts were presented in an easy to understand and engaging manner.
10375,very good course
10376,Excellent course to get the ball rolling!
10377,Very useful course.
10378,Videos are simple and easy to understand.
10379,The professor really needs to make the course more exciting - you don't need to be educated to know enthusiasm promotes content reception.
10380,Very clear introduction to the basics of front-end.
10381,"i think this is the best course of html and css online that i could found ,thank you coursera for the opportunity to learn it"
10382,Excellent course and interesting assignments.
10383,great course especially the JS part
10384,Simply great!
10385,a good job
10386,It's not bad but I think the other courses in this specialization are much better
10387,This a great beginners Course.Each concept is explained clearly and precisely.
10388,"Thank you, this course is very helpful and I learned great things from it"
10389,Well planned course. A little too easy though
10390,Loved it!
10391,"A nice, short introductory course to web programming languages. May move a little fast for a newbie."
10392,"This course was very nice. It was kind of a bit basic, but that's what I've expected of a beginner course which is covering basic and the most important factors of web technologies. The reason I give 4 stars is that everything is too much served on the plate. Assignments are prepared really, really well, which kind of loses the point. You almost don't need to think about anything to finish the assignment. Overall, awesome course!"
10393,Awesome!Perfect!
10394,Nice course
10395,"Nice course, although it could be even better if it lasted for 4 weeks, where the last week would cover pure javascript in much more depth."
10396,A complete and didactic course.
10397,One week shorter than other similar courses but the eLearning lectures are of excellent quality and the assignments do stretch you to learn 
10398,Good course!
10399,super
10400,Great! platform to improve our skills.....
10401,"This is a nice course and it was worth learning it from COURSERA!!! Both the pattern of the course and videos are precise and to the point. Also, self-paced makes it possible to get adjusted according to everyone schedule."
10402,"Excellent work, gives all basic knowledge to a new comer to web development and HTML/CSS basics. Needs more practical examples if possible. "
10403,Good course the teacher is a good teacher
10404,Really great to get yourself jump-stated! Excellent lectures too!
10405,I want more practice
10406,Really covers the basics
10407,"I enjoyed taking this course. It was my first touch with Html, CSS and Javascript... and I can say that I learnt a lot. "
10408,Good explanation of the concepts. Need commintment
10409,great course. it offers a great background about html css and js
10410,"great course,learned a lot!"
10411,It's a good course for beginner student
10412,such a great course !
10413,3rd project can be made little more simpler !!! for begineer its really difficult .
10414, Great 
10415,"In my opinion this course is too simple for anyone who have a bit of programming experience. On other hand, it is a base course and it is excellent for any other person with no experience. "
10416,Very fun course and clear to understand. I would redo them just for fun but don't have time for that yet!
10417,I think this course is very successful. 
10418,Excelent proffesor! 
10419,Very good introduction
10420,"Loved the real-world concepts, great starter course on HTML, CSS and JS"
10421,"Very well taught course. I finally understand how Javascript, HTML and CSS come together to form a webpage. Highly recommend this course!"
10422,"Not very good explain javascript. After this course I had many questions about this language, I not understood it enough."
10423,Muito bom.
10424,"I really enjoyed this class. A lot of information; lots of hands-on examples. I've taken JavaScript before, but this class really helped to me to use it."
10425,Good course with quite a bit of material
10426,"A very good way to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, or refresh your old knowledge and learn some new skills. Very easy to understand even if english is not your language. I recommend it."
10427,Very good course for beginners.
10428,Good assignment.
10429,it is a very good beginner level course and i enjoyed it a lot
10430,"Even though I had some previous knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript, I still learn quite a few useful things trough the course. Definitely recommend to all beginners!"
10431,Awesome! Amazing! These online courses ARE the Future!
10432,great course
10433,A bit too simple for my liking. And too many repeated content. But overall a good course for an absolute beginner.
10434,A brilliant course. I had a great time going through the lectures and had fun with the assignments. Thank you for this course.
10435,"Very very good, I learnt so much in this course.Thanks coursera for the oportunity."
10436,"Quickly covered basic HTML, JS, and CSS.Assignment descriptions were clear.There were a few tricky bits mostly related to styling that were more frustrating than it seems like they should have been, but overall a very good course. However, the project time given for the course is very optimistic, it usually always took much longer."
10437,"I tried to study HTML, CSS and JS at first. Because his lectures was so detail, I could understand it. "
10438,"Overall, I found the course to be an excellent refresher and, in some ways, an expander of my existing HTML, CSS and JS knowledge. The only suggestion I would offer is to explain how and why the particular information is useful. Examples can cement an abstract concept. "
10439,"Pretty good basic overview of HTML, CSS and Javascript."
10440,"Great instruction, well-described. Assignments felt like logical extensions of the material presented."
10441,It was a nice course although I'd have appreciated more if it could have been more in depth with CSS... 
10442,Teacher was very good.
10443,Very good introduction to web technologies.
10444,Unnecessary course for this kind of specialization... 
10445,"I am a Java Expert and over 10 years of experience in Software Engineering. So a lot things like controle structures are well know to me. However it was never boring and I had a lot of fun getting into HTML, CSS and JavaScript."
10446,The course covers up all the basics in the most clear way. Definetely worth the time!
10447,wonderful
10448,"Covers all HTML fundaments, CSS basica and JS basic."
10449,the teacher is amazing I wish he was the same one who teach us the rest of fullstack of webdevelopment
10450,Great course ! 
10451,"Practical, not just syntax, but examples you can build on."
10452,looking forward to learn more.
10453,Excellent for Beginners
10454,All is greate !!! Thanks!
10455,Course is well structured and very helpful!
10456,Very well presented and informative. Some of the early assignments are hard to grade if the person makes a small mistake and the only possible marks are 0% and 100%.
10457,"Valuable course as a start point, got a general overview of all components in a web system and also got started on basic front end design."
10458,"Learning new skill through succinct teaching was a wonderful experience. The course covered good details of the programming languages, but personally I think it was not in-dept learning. I think more learning material along with advanced assignments should be provided for more vivid learners.Overall, it was a course worth taking for me.-Bhushan "
10459,Ecellent Course
10460,excellent class!
10461,excellent 
10462,This course is designed very well.
10463,This course was really useful for me. Good teacher and material.
10464,Excellent introduction.
10465,Very useful for web developers beginners.
10466,Nice course for basic learning and strong foundations!!
10467,Content is good enough for beginners in web development but must have previously programming experience. The assignments are very strong and help understanding more. I think this is a good start point but some other operation on images and styles not covered.
10468,"The detailed step by step class made me understood this course clearly. David made it easy for beginners to understand this course.In general, reviewing the classmate's assignment is definitely a great idea to learn from other's code and improve your coding skill."
10469,David Rossiter is an excellent Instructor. He was very clear and precise. I learned a lot and as a result I purchased the series.
10470,Good course to teach you the basics :) 
10471,Great course!
10472,Very nice introduction. Very structured and good assignments.
10473,This really helps me to learn the knowledge of making a webpage.
10474,Great work I must say. Very concise and straight to the point. Great job guys! 
10475,Was a great refresher for me 
10476,Nice introduction!
10477,"Great introduction to the basics of all three areas. It may feel easy if you have programming experience, but it will give you a good introduction to what's to come in the following courses."
10478,Cool! A lot of great presented information!
10479,Lessons are really easy to understand. This course helped me understand what I needed to know to easily catch up with the next set of courses.
10480,An interesting course to introduce the basic concepts of HTML. I had a background about HTML however I learned new things.
10481,Excelente oportunidade de aprendizado.
10482,Excellent course! It was a great refresher for me on HTML and CSS. It has been a great and funny introduction to Javascript as well
10483,"Gives you needed basics on HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the rest of the specialisation. However, could definitely expand the JS aspects a lot more. Explaining the type system, the prototype chain concepts, making us aware of what the language can and can not do. 1 to 2 more weeks would have been expected from this course."
10484,"Very good class, professor is very entertaining. Concepts take into account the latest &amp; greatest of HTML &amp; JS. In general, i think a price of $79 is too high for a MOOC class of 3 weeks duration "
10485,Overall a good course!
10486,Great!
10487,done very well that even us novices could follow
10488,very good . 
10489,"This course is very effective to build up the basic foundation of HTML,CSS and JS."
10490,Good course
10491,very clear and accessible
10492,"This is a pretty good course for learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I already had some experience with these three languages, so consider that when reading this review. I found that the amount of information they cram into this three week course was pretty substantial, which I think is a positive aspect of the course. They don't just teach you what you need to complete the exercises, they teach you a lot of things that even more experienced users of this language may have forgotten. That being said, I don't think the amount of information covered is realistically anyone could retain in three weeks. I would instead see this course as a crash course as to what features are available with these three languages, then save the course slides as sort of a reference for when you go off on your own. My favorite part of this course is that the exercises are unique and fun. The HTML assignment is sort of boring, but that's because HTML is boring, but the exercises that use javascript are a lot of fun. To conclude, I think this course would be great for brand new web developers and also for people who just need a refresher. Good luck!"
10493,useful course.
10494,Very clear and easy to understand.
10495,"Fast and to the point. The way i like it. 3 weeks and you're set up to where you can get around in HTML, CSS and Java."
10496,Excellent very good introduction especially recommended javascript
10497,"One of the best course I have ever take, what I like the most is on assignment part. The lecturer give me a good instruction of assignment which helped me did it perfectly. Step by step, knowing that I need to develop these step by step logic required to solve the problems."
10498,"The best course for absolute beginners, and also professionals who forgot to write javascript code without jquery! "
10499,"Excellent material, Knowledgeable trainer, Nice short quiz and exercises, hands-on assignments with clues and study materials. Last but not the least, reviewing others assignments and learning from others. Really enjoyed learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. "
10500,Very efective course to start. 
10501,"??timo, muito estimulador e quem n??o sabe muito de ingl??s pode baixar o v??deo e baixar legendas para traduzi-las."
10502,Well organized course material. Detailed examples illustrates the concepts in a clear way.
10503,Great teacher and an excellent intro to front end development.
10504,Just excellent!!!
10505,"Javascript &amp; HTML are covered nicely for a 3 week course &amp; enables us to learn anything new from the web on our own. The course lacks in the coverage of CSS (Hence the 4 stars &amp; not 5).The final project was very nice &amp; interesting, so much so that I have been developing it further &amp; have added many more features to it."
10506,"This course covered a lot of ground in only 3 weeks. It gave me the knowledge and confidence to create a JavaScript solution to a website problem shortly after I finished it. It is structured logically, with well-planned exercises that reinforce learning. "
10507,Liked the class
10508,"A very good introduction class for the basics of web development. Don't expect to come out a full fledged Javascript programmer but it gives you the important parts of DOM manipulation. If you want to start with web development, go and check this class out. "
10509,excelente curso
10510,"Excellent course on the fundamental building blocks of the web. Even though I thought I knew these topics, I still learned some things I didn't know, and had fun doing so!"
10511,Very basic and not especially much fun or challenging
10512,Good course to learn some basics. Skip it if you are at an intermediate level.
10513,Excellent teacher and course material.
10514,Absolutely great!!
10515,great
10516,"A good course, the methods and pace was not good enough. I wonder if those new to these topics learnt anything"
10517,"The course deserves to be registered and followed. It worth for newbies to learn these technologies HTML, CSS and JS. The course follows with lectures, practice questions and weekly assignment which make the learner keep interested during the course. Instructor is an Intelligent and Awesome personality. He teaches really very well.. Recommended for Newbies !!"
10518," Nice course! I've learnt a lot. Thank you, David. "
10519,A very good course and covers a wide range of topics especially in JavaScript.
10520,The assessments are great to handle the concepts of the course. Particularly evaluating the work of others is very instructing. The instructor is great and is a pleasure to listen to.
10521,Amazing online class and learning environment.
10522,"Es una introducci??n muy completa. Es necesario aprender simultaneamente dobre los tres lenguajes, ya que la funcionalidad de los mismos se veria muy limitada al no hacerlo."
10523,Great course
10524,"I enjoyed the course to review my CSS/HTML skills and get started on JavaScript. I would recommend this course if you have some preliminary experience. If you are completely new to these materials it might be worth doing an introductory course first, as this course is fast-paced and for a beginners many details might be missing. "
10525,Good Intro to the front-end holy trinity!
10526,Great teach
10527,"Great course, go strait to the point. You will learn the basics of Html CSS and Javascript with the smile. "
10528,"This course is very good for people who want to get some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. While it is not that long, it gives you practical experience and teaches you to do some practical things. I'd rather recommend it to people who already have some basic experience with web and programming (in any language), but the bar is not that high even for beginners. Module videos and explanations are good and David Rossiter, who created the course, has my thanks and respect. "
10529,very good course but it is kinda fast for new people 
10530,"A nice introductory course, short but with a lot of stuff covered, good for busy people. I only miss some jquery introduction. Thanks professor David Rossiter."
10531,It's quite too simple even with no previous knowledge
10532,"The course is well designed and well presented. I wished for a bit more material on CSS and JavaScript. Perhaps, due to time constraints, there could be a separate course for looking at CSS and JavaScript at a more in-depth level."
10533,It the One of the Best course in HTML CSS and JavaScript Excise is fun and the assignment is totally challenging. I recommend this course. Just go for it.
10534,"This course was very informative, challenging and productive. Well designed, it helped me learn a lot!"
10535,Excellent course by David Rossiter. One of the best online courses that I have attended. Super Stuff
10536,"The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html/css and fully dives into JavaScript. If you are not familiar with JavaScript, I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering. Still if you are a total noob, you should take the course anyway, as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object-oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer.Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues, grading, and discussion board input, I gave the course a 3 out of 5. My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though. "
10537,great course. fast paced for the absolute beginner
10538,Excellent course! Content is easy to comprehend and flexible. Professor is good having clear communication. I highly recommend this course for the beginners or if you want to refresh theses skills.
10539,a good start to learn web design from this course.
10540,"Well-designed courses, good exercises."
10541,Pretty straightforward but explores many web design concepts.
10542,Great Course ....Good assignments and Great lectures
10543,"If all teacher were to present their lectures in the manner this course was presented, I don't think any student would find it difficult to understand the subject, no matter have hard it is. They made web programming a seem like taking a nice cup of tea!"
10544,"This class was a great introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for someone with prior programing experience (I've done Python, R, MATLAB, and a tiny bit of C++). It was exactly the overview of all the basic/most important features of the three languages (I use quotes because HTML is actually a language). By no means will this make you any kind of expert, but if you're interested in web development on the side and already know how to program, this is a great place to start."
10545,"Very good course. Whether you're a beginner or intermediate, this course will boost your skills in HTML, CSS and JS. One of the best courses I've taken in a while. "
10546,"Hastily put together. Quickly steps over lots of material, some of it is out of order. There is an entire video in week three, that covers material needed to complete the assignment the week before, for example."
10547,"Good and interesting course. I think it should have a bit more formalization. For example, in HTML part there was no information about W3C validation tool. Also for example there was no accent on some essential parts of HTML:1. According the W3C specification, the src attribute of &lt;img&gt; tag must be present2. There was no accent that for attribute of &lt;label&gt; tag should correspond to the ID of form element so in homework review I saw situations when this attribute was set to name instead of ID."
10548,Great course. Excellent instructor.
10549,This course covers a lot of ground and builds a good foundation of knowledge in the subject.
10550,"Content is good but can include more advanced topics in Javascript like various patterns eg IIFE, Module etc. Also, I reckon there should have been some material on Javascript classes,objects etc. As a whole this tutorial is excellent but could have been even better wit above topics included in detail. "
10551,It was very educative.
10552,"I think it's useless. Spending that amount of time explaining this basics it is not worth it. I'd rather go deeper in AngularJS, NodeJS or Ionic, after all this is a course for a mid level, so you should go to another course to take the basics and here a more advanced level."
10553,Good teaching
10554,"This course has a very good level , very well structured , I enjoyed doing it and I learned a lot of things in a very short period of time .It is very intensive and very professionnal."
10555,Great introductory Course! The professor was easy to understand and took the time to explain in a clear and concise manner! Great job!
10556,Good course. Happy to have finished it!
10557,Gives you the basics what you need to develop your skills further! Good one!
10558,Awesome course!!!
10559,"I'm not giving the fifth star just because there is only one flaw: not enough interaction between the teacher/TAs and the students. In fact, I never saw the staff participating in the discussions."
10560,"Great introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript"
10561,Good introduction to the base of web developpment
10562,Nice introduction to web development.
10563,Good introductory course to some essential components of Web Development! 
10564,Really enjoyed the course.
10565,Great Course to learn the basics.
10566,Great!
10567,need more engagement and exercises before every week task 
10568,Its pretty basic but it is a good start for the entire specialization.Thank you
10569,Good course but I think it needs more Javascript materials.
10570,Nice work please keep going in the same way
10571,"Pretty good introduction course. Not very thorough as all starters, but nicely composed and presented. "
10572,Good starter course.
10573,Great instructor with great presentation methods that make learning course content simple and straight forward. Would recommend to anyone needing to get web basics into their toolbox of skills.
10574,"Cool, very complete introduction"
10575,Wonderful course !!!!
10576,"Wonderful course! Instruction was helpful, interesting and useful. I highly recommend! "
10577,Everything is explained in very elegant way. Overall an awesome course
10578,"I enjoyed a lot the course and I think, even if it takes 3 weeks and looks short it isn't, it's very complete and teaches you the basis to grow up by yourself but at the same time to start creating :)"
10579,"An awesome course! I learned a lot of HTML, CSS and JS. "
10580,I think your home assignments should be more difficult.
10581,Great course
10582,Great course for those beginning web development.
10583,A great course for beginners but there was too much detail for submitting assignments.
10584,Basic level.
10585,Good course.By Rafael Rodriguez from Venezuela.
10586,Very useful course.
10587,Great instructor with useful contests. 
10588,Good overview of all three core web technologies. The price seems a bit high though if you're considering the verified certificate.
10589,Is a good introduction 
10590,Excellent course but it would have been better to include some simple exercises to help with learning the javascript
10591,I had fun refreshing the basic concepts of HTML and looking at basic h=javascript programs
10592,its amazing to be a part of this course learnt a lot 
10593,good lessons!
10594,Great introduction to the subject.
10595,A very good entry to front-end web design
10596,"Muy buen curso, el instructor es una persona que sabe explicar muy bien, los ejercicios son muy buenos y entiendes muy bien el tema. Adem??s las tareas ayudaron mucho a entender los conceptos vistos. Daban buenos apuntes y ejemplos con los que te puedes ir guiando a lo largo del curso, sin duda muy recomendable."
10597,Very good course for greenhand!
10598,Very balanced and well-paced course
10599,Great Basics and hands on assignments to get to know a bit about html and css and play around with javascript
10600,Excellent CourseThank you !!!
10601,Basic with some level of advance Course for Web Dev
10602,"Good course, with useful examples and methodology!"
10603,"Originally, I rated this course 3-stars. However, I have since decided it is worth 1-star after taking the next course in the series, Bootstrap. I thought that there wasn't enough time to cover all the material to make this course good. After taking the next course, I see that it is possible to deliver a lot of material and concepts in short order. However, it takes thinking, planning, and dedication. I think this course is TERRIBLE and seriously needs an overhaul. After taking this course, you barely know any CSS and despite passing assignments that don't challenge, you're probably worse off than a student who fails in school. The course suffers from the extremely short timeframe. Covering one of each of the three core topics a week is just insufficient to provide any sort of depth to this course. While there are supplementary readings, Coursera and the participating institutions need to understand that there are those who are taking courses to get more than a one page Wiki style coverage of a topic."
10604,The course covers basics very well.
10605,Excelent course. Very clear and well structured.
10606,Great course!
10607,"This course helped expand on my JavaScript knowledge, particularly concerning DOM structure. However, if I had been a beginner in any of these topics, I'm not sure if this course would have been enough. Not much time is spent on clarifying HTML and CSS, i.e., there were a lot of topics untouched. Additionally, while the instructor's videos were excellent, the professor did not participate in course discussions at all. I think there were many times when he should have been available to lend a helping/clarifying hand."
10608,Really good for the ones who just started also the ones need to refresh their mind.
10609,Good introduction with practice.
10610,good for start 
10611,"Loved the course, only draw back is that students are marking assignments."
10612,really nice course as an introduction to css and javascript
10613,Very good and easily explained concepts with useful examples. Recommended for newbies as well as experienced programmers for a quick refresh
10614,well taught and easily understood
10615,more excercises should be added to the course 
10616,"Exercises could have been tougher so that we could reinforce learning material and also try to learn how to search the web to find the solution to a bug.Before a month, all I knew was Javascript was tough.Thanks for making me feel confident programming in Javascript.Thank You."
10617,Easy to understand and follow. Highly recommended for beginners with no experience about any of these subjects. Practical assignments at the end of every week help me to remember and actually use what I have learnt during the course
10618,"Great course! I've learned a lot and it was fun. Might not be suitable for total beginners, though."
10619,One of the better courses on Coursera! Well done and thank you for sharing knowledge.But we need more of David and his teachingskills!!! MORE!
10620,"Hello David Rossiter,Thank you very much for this course. It was clear, simple and precise.RegardsAravind"
10621,Balanced
10622,This course guides learners of various proficiency very well. Dave was very thorough and methodical in his approach. Assignments are of moderate competency to complete with out any difficulties. 
10623,"very good for beginners and intermediate programmers to review the concept of HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics! "
10624,Well explained course and good for the beginners.
10625,This is an excellent course. Thank you! 
10626,Nice introduction to the subject. Teacher and presentations were easy to understand and not too dry. Homework assignments were interesting and peer reviewing other people's submissions helped get pointers on what I could've done better.
10627,Great course!
10628,"This is a very good introductive course. It's easy to follow, it's explicative and offers extra resources to complement the contents and deep."
10629,"Overall it's a good intro if you know nothing or very little about those topics.That said, the class is too slow.Homework is too easy and boring. It's all about following very specific (long) instructions - put this line of JS here, create a function called Foo, etc.Grading is done by peers, even though it could be automated. Participation requires running arbitrary JS written by other students."
10630,"Course was what I expected. I'm a software engineer, so the work wasn't terribly difficult. I did find it a decent academic intro to the subject matter. "
10631,"Clear materials, good examples, good pace, well thought through assignments.Prof did a great job!Thank you."
10632,Good Quick Ad contains sufficient topics for a beginner.
10633,"Excellent course, good teacher, good lessons, a lot of new things!"
10634,"Plus: Lots of information for a beginner course, covers a lot of ground in HTML/CSS/JS. Some applications requiring building web-pages and JS programs to get hands-on experienceNegative: HTML/CSS and to a less extent JS introduced pretty much as a list of disconnected tags/attributes etc, leaves some confusion as to how it all fits together, but that probably can't be avoided when covering a lot of ground in a short 3 weeks beginner course"
10635,Good introduction course.
10636,This was a great course that taught the basics of web development. The professor explained the concepts really well and in an easy-to-understand way.
10637,I really liked the way it was taught. I could skip through the areas I was competent. Helped me fill the gaps. I strongly recommend this course. 
10638,I think this is the best course for everybody who wants to learn basics about web development. These assignments are interesting and help the student more understanding your the knowledge.
10639,"Excellent introduction, with very apt assignments."
10640,This is a very good course; got me started on the path of web development. The lessons and explanation were very good and clear. Thanks.
10641,The grading is kinda problematic because you can just grade with 1 or 0 nothing in between. Also for the assignments it is hard sometimes to figure out how to solve the problems and external materials are needed.The professor is really good though and so are the lectures!!!!
10642,Loved it
10643,Good course
10644,Excellent course but it moves very fast! Stay caught up with the work and you will do good!
10645,Excellent Course not just for beginners! You should have little programming experience before. Learnt a lot about DOM in javascript which helped me in my current job.
10646,"Pros:A basic introduction to the 3 core front-end technologies. The Professor has structured the course in a logical and easy to follow progressive format. The presentations are professionally done with quality audio and HD video. (The Professor speaks with a clear proper British accent). If watching online, there are helpful short quizzes built into the videos to make sure people are not skipping ahead. (Not sure if these 'video quizzes are graded, but I think they are helpful) Cons:The projects are helpful to reinforce logic and programming concepts, however, they are not real world and may be too simple to be of real value. One will need supplemental resources to fill in the gaps for the projects. I would have liked a real world example, even if it was beyond the scope of the course."
10647,Great course. Looking forward to start other courses from whole specialization. Fantastic work.
10648,Very good
10649,"This is THE BEST course I have ever taken on coursera or else. Very simple but effective, complex things are made bit simple to learn. Just in 3 weeks, covered a good contents. Specially the way of teaching was bit simple but outstanding. Pleasure to be a part of this course"
10650,It could ask more of the student. The assigments was read and do.
10651,"Great explanation showing a lot of details, the assignments were very well explained and helped a lot in learning.If the videos were shorter in time it would be better."
10652,Enjoyed the course and learned a lot within short three weeks. Assignments that are peer-reviewed really help with learning and seeing different ways to tackling same problems.
10653,excellent introductory course
10654,Nice course material. The assignments are interesting and fun to work on. Looking forward to more such courses ! 
10655,Incredible course
10656,Lectures were intuitive. The way assignments were designed is the best
10657,I recommend this course for every beginner in data science.
10658,Great course !!!
10659,Very nice course with introduction to Data analysis!
10660,"I am disappointed because the course doesn't provide profound material on data analysis with python. The videos are too short and the samples demonstrated in the videos aren't thoroughly explained. For instance, the speaker often only says what she is doing but not WHY she is doing it or what the function of a particular parameter is. I felt left alone and forced to google. In my opinion it cannot be the purpose to make your student google basic things that could easily be integrated into the course.Considering that this is labelled as a beginner course I was expecting much more theoretical input. Other courses offer additional slides and scripts that are aligend with the course videos and allow the students to look things up."
10661,Excellent course. I do recommend this course for anyone who is interested in analytics. 
10662,"I would prefer more coding example provided by the professor, I will be super useful."
10663,The course was informative and stretched me a bit. 
10664,The course is really helpful for beginners and is explained in a very simple manner.
10665,"The instructions for submitting through Tumblr are not specific enough, especially after Week 1. "
10666,Terrible. A waste of time and money. I recommend doing Statistics with R from Duke instead. This one should be taken off coursera.
10667,"As an English speaking student, I felt this course was easy to follow and translated a complex subject into a step by step process of interpreting data. I like the hands-on development of a research question and learning the SAS and PYTHON Data Analytic software coding to extrapolate information from data sets. I didn't like the fact that it was difficult to get an instructor to respond in the forums and very difficult figuring out how to contact Coursera with any problems. "
10668,Great course! Thanks!
10669,Curso que explica a detalle todas las caracter??sticas del proceso de recopilaci??n y an??lisis de la informaci??n.
10670,Perfect for beginners
10671,"Being the first ever course I took seriously with, it was fun and a new experience. Liked it. The way of teaching, the unique grading technique used by coursera, the tutors were perfect and to sum it up it was much more than I expected."
10672,got to grips with SAS
10673,Very helpful videos and clear explanations. Easy to follow up.
10674,"The course is great otherwise, however the certificate of this course just completed 'Data Management and Visualization' with no mention about the skills learnt or the grade attained. Primary reason I enrolled to the course was to list 'SAS' (basic) as a skill in my resume, however the certificate does not mention anything about SAS. If at least the certificate said completed 'Data Management and Visualization with SAS', it would be a good value for money. I strongly recommend Coursera should look into this. Thanks!"
10675,Excellent...
10676,This is a good course. I have done stats in the past so i was using this as a refresher but also to advance my python skills a bit more. I think you should take an introduction course to python first. you will get more out of the coding examples. I suggest the Intro to Python by the University of Toronto at Coursera. I found that to be an excellent course.I find that in these lectures they do a great job in explaining the stats theory. They do not dwell to much into the science behind it but more the applicability. This is all good. You can simply do a little additional research and get the pure science behind of it all
10677,perfect first touch with data management
10678,Very good summarization and introduction of data analysis process
10679,Cours tr??s int??ressant sur la gestion et la visualisation des donn??es mais ??a serait beaucoup mieux d'approfondir un peu le contexte de ce cours.
10680,Course content good but a little too basic in my eyes. I think the addition of more functions in SAS/Python would be useful. Having to do peer reviews is also not ideal.
10681,"A decent start for anyone interested in learning the basics. However, please make sure you add extra efforts from your end in understanding stats concepts if you are totally new to the subject as well as browsing things related to usage of SAS or python. The course touches only the basics so it is up the learner to explore and learn more about interested statistical tool."
10682,Totally just marketing materials! Don't waste your time with this school at all! You cannot learn a program in a couple of minutes! 
10683,"A very beginner level course aimed at starters who dont have much experience with Data. Emphasis was on teaching Data Management with area of our interest. In Order to support this, assignments didnt had clear objective. I would have learnt a lot more through a course had they been more defined assignments.Not a course if you are looking to be ready for data related interviews. However, this course will be okay if you are working on some other field and want data management as an extra skillset."
10684,My name is Jose Antonio from Brazil. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications. The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructors.
10685,"Great course, clear introduction to concepts and code"
10686,Good classes for learning SAS
10687,"It is a good beginners course but I think there are better lessons in SAS and Python if learning these is your goal, and the content in data cleaning and visual analysis is very basic. "
10688,Very nice course! Good starting point of learning SAS!
10689,Very easy and very helpful course
10690,Good Course simplistic way in explaining core concepts
10691,Excellent introduction to SAS no matter what your field of research. Videos are clear and easy to follow. Looking forward to doing the next course.
10692,"The professor and instructors don't understand how to properly write SAS programs and ignored constructive feedback. It's very sad to see students follow suit by producing hard to read codes, ignoring programming conventions. As an analytic leader in healthcare industry (I am supervising some of my junior level team members to get some basic training), I want to say something to the students graduated from this course: if you program the same way as being taught, you will lose a competitive advantage during job interview."
10693,"This course didn't talk too much about data management and visualization, which made me feel quite disappointed. And you couldn't feel you could practiced what you learned in the course in the assignment. Most part of the assignment just focused on making some comments. "
10694,"I'd pick 3.7 or so, really. The applied nature of the course is nice if you have a project in mind and to see the programming you learn in action. Without it, it might not be worth it because you could learn a lot of the SAS programming for free from SAS itself using their beginning programming coursework offered online (in fact potential students may consider taking the SAS programming essentials course before taking this because you learn a lot about the SAS coding framework that comes in handy for this class)."
10695,wonderful study experience???
10696,Really smooth conduct of people in videos and excellent way of explaining things. Very excited to keep going to see what this specialization has to offer further. Thank you.
10697,Very Knowledgeable and interesting course.
10698,"A fantastic course for beginners, and an extremely useful tool to learn! Recommended for anyone who wants to get started coding or increase their work skills"
10699,This course is very good especially for beginners getting started with SAS or python for data analytics. The lessons are very clear and easy to understand. Learnt a lot of valuable information and also enjoyed it. 
10700,"It is a very nice course, although I was expecting something a little deeper / denser on both statistics and SAS programming. It is getting better on Module 2! =)"
10701,It's very clear and innovative!
10702, Excellent course easy to understand and very practice evaluation 
10703,Tr??s bon cours. Je le recommande.
10704,Nice introductory course to learning both SAS and Python in data analysis! I look forward to taking the next course!
10705,"I appreciate the fact that this course doesn't go into the fine detail on how to code everything, I believe there is still more information on the coding and data management practices that could be included in the course content. In addition to that, I feel the course could use the following adjustments to make it better:1 - Have Python students grade other Python students and SAS students grade other SAS students. While it is nice to get exposure to another language, it is more than enough to learn one at a time.2 - Add quizes and/or other well formed questions that are graded (automatically, not peer graded) to help enforce the concepts being taught.3 - Make the assignment instructions/expectations more clear. I feel there are times when the grading criteria don't exactly match the requested assignment. While people follow the spirit of the assignment, the grading questions may ask for slightly different or additional items.4 - Certain aspects of statistical analysis are glossed over and should be covered in more depth in the training videos. While I like the short videos for brevity, I would prefer to watch 10-15 minutes more content and really feel like the material was well covered."
10706, It was really good. 
10707,"I think the course is wonderful for beginners. For somebody trying to learn this on her own, I found this course extremely helpful and easy to grasp. "
10708,Great way to get started in this field!
10709,It was a great course for me! It gives a very important basic of statistic &amp; visualization.I really appreciated the way it was presented.
10710,It is too small and shallow. Whole specialization is actually one full course split into 4 tiny parts.
10711,"Great! Easy to follow, very well video lecture, and very useful!"
10712,great
10713,Great
10714,This course states that it is for people with no knowledge in SAS. I had to go online elsewhere to learn SAS before completing this course. There are free SAS tutorials on the SAS webpage - I highly recommend completing them before trying this course. 
10715,Choosing an actual research question allows you to find a topic of interest. This makes the content more meaningful and accelerates understanding of the concepts.
10716,It's very useful.
10717,"This course is very simplistic, but interesting. I was able to complete the first 3 modules within a week, however I am somewhat skilled in this area. I was looking for something more difficult. However, my main goal was learning these techniques in python. It was frustrating that it took so long until we actually produced graphs (I don't like just looking at tables). However, all in all, it was useful and interesting -- I really like the applications-based approach. You get to analyze data about whatever YOU are interested in!"
10718,Course material needs to updated to reflect current software updates.
10719, Noiiice! 
10720,perfect class
10721,"There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions. In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code. This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before. "
10722,there is not enough instruction of using SAS online~
10723,"Simple material, and nicely presented. Good choice for beginners"
10724,"Simple and powerful Course. If you are a beginner. Just follow the instructions and Assignment Schedule. The course may seem a bit easy, if you are good at math and have some prior programming experience, yet you can be surprised with what new you learned by the end of the Course, considering the time you spend. Also you develop sound reasoning to answer your own questions regarding handling and presenting Data. The clarity you develop is worth it. "
10725,The content is easy to follow and is clearly explained without adding unnecessary complexity at this entry level. This specialization reaches its goals. Instead of trying to over achieve it keeps things simple.I would recommend taking the Data Science Specialization as the next step.
10726,Hace falta que el staff del curso responda las preguntas que se hacen en los foros para que el aprendizaje est?? mejor orientado.
10727,"It was good overall, some of the course materials were a bit sparse. You had to do your own research into getting packages working in spyder etc. I'd probably recommend that learners learn some python separately and read the docs for pandas."
10728,"Very superficial. Too few in statistics, too much in python and SAS."
10729,"simply a great start to data science , very practical skills "
10730,The course videos are fantastic
10731,Well done. Thank you.
10732,Awesome course. Thanks Prof.
10733,"Thank you so much for the course! I liked the research project, it game me a lot of interesting knowledge. I thought in the beginning it is pretty easy course but the last assignment took me a while. "
10734,I saw little interactions between students and in the discussion list. But I liked to learn a new language!
10735,The perfect pace for students new to statistical programming. 
10736,Excellent!
10737,Easy to understand!
10738,"The course has its positives, but overall does not perform well instructing on the use of the two statistical software offered (SAS &amp; Python). At the beginning they offer multiple data sets to use and formulate a research question, but all the examples utilize only one data set and do not cover the differences you might face with the other data sets - leading to a lot of missed opportunities. Additionally, the tutorials for using the statistical software do not lend themselves towards a thorough understanding and more to a route learning."
10739,"Very good introductory course on managing, subsetting, and manipulating data with SAS or Python."
10740,"Very disappointed about this course. The topic is very interesting, for me at least, but the course organization is horrible. Lectures do not provide enough information to complete the assignments. Zero interaction from course staff. Issues with getting assignments graded. In previous session the staff just refered you to the coursera helpdesk, but you cannot easily contact coursera directly. Main focus of course seems to be earning money and not educating. Be warned and don't pay for this course!I really don't get why this course has so many good reviews."
10741,Very good references - codebooks and examples.
10742,"So far, course is one of the best I am taking. It moves at a slow enough pace that you feel you can actually learn explore but at the same time are not bored. The videos are well done and have the right balance of interesting content and skill building. "
10743,Very well organised and I really admire the project based approach that is and will be followed throughout the specialization.Thank you
10744,"The highest video production values of any class I've seen on Coursera so far. Unfortunately, that's the best part of the class; the support is simply nonexistent (a post by someone associated with the staff from a previous run of the course suggests getting help troubleshooting Python from Coursera staff), the instructions for the class software are out of date, the source material for the assignments is sometimes unsuitable to the task you're asked to perform (e.g. statistical analysis on a data set aggregated from disparate sources), and the pretty videos are at times completely unrelated to the actual assignments (the very first week with the literature review). Dropping this specialization like a hot coal; it looked quite promising, but the aggravation over the poor organization and lack of support considerably outweighs anything I could get out of it."
10745,Very nice lecture videos and explanations! Totally worth it
10746,"The course is a very good introduction to Python for data exploration and management. That being said, it focuses too much on categorical data analysis, and I felt the transition to quantitative/continuous data was not very well done.Moreover, some more explanations about several Python functions or coding choices could be better explained.But it's encouraging to see this type of statistical course for Python and not R!! Again!"
10747,Great course! Perfect for starting in analysis of data
10748,I really enjoyed this course. Have been using Python for years but never jumped into data management and visualization. This course helped me doing that and presenting results in a beautiful and useful way.I am not rating with 5 starts because the rating system is cumbersome. I submitted my first assignment late and they were not peers to review my work so I am still waiting after a month of rejoining the course.
10749,It is one of the most structured course that I have ever seen On line and is very simple to understand.
10750,"The content is OK, but that's about it. Near zero interaction from staff, short videos leave a lot to be desired, and worst of all, there seems to be a problem getting everyone's assignments peer reviewed (which makes no sense). There is a somewhat comical thread wherein staff direct students to contact coursera directly via a contact us link on a page, but get this, the link isn't there. Students repeatedly pointed this out only to get directed again to the non-existant link. In an online forum it's important to actually address concerns. Replys that avoid directly addressing concerns sound like automated messages. And that's the feeling I get here. This course requires a DIY attitude and a willingness to proceed without feedback. If you're looking for a good example of online learning, look elsewhere."
10751,The slides are excellent and instructions are clear and to the point. But that point is very limited. The main negative about this class is that there is absolutely no student/TA/teacher feedback and you're pretty much on your own learning. 
10752,"I have never used SAS. I have done minimal statistics and my major in university was Sociology, which I did 20 years ago. So needless to say, I don't remember much. This course was easy to understand and was structured in a way to build upon knowledge from one week to the next. "
10753,this is not a review its my personal progress bar
10754,I love blogging and i love data science. This course brings the best of the both worlds :)
10755,"Bad material, poor graphics, wrong mc questions in videos. More hype content than a course.This is not the way to learn Python, seriously don't take this one"
10756,Great step to learn data analysis in SAS! 
10757,Wish they offered R
10758,Simply excellent!!
10759,"excellent, thanks "
10760,"The support from the faculty and the website is beyond explainable bad. The user interface gets stuck without reasons. There is no direct way to contact the faculty, if you are stuck on any assignments. There is hardly anyone who responds to the feedback that is sought for!!I will never recommend someone to do this course."
10761,"They put a lot of effort into this course, but especially for the videos it was a bit too much. So many different visual backgrounds, sounds, music, text floating it... It's as if they just wanted to use everything, while never thinking about when it would start being too distracting."
10762,Beautifully designed course. Really helps me understand basic data analysis and improve reporting skills. 
10763,Good Learning experience and loved the way of teaching.
10764,Brilliant course!
10765,I really enjoy learning from the teachers of this prestigious Univresity.Videos are not boring and the material is great.
10766,Well presented and useful; assignments mirror lectures
10767,excellent course especially for those interested into playing with data
10768,amazing
10769,Really enjoyed this class. Just wish it could've gone into more statistical depth.
10770,"This class is well produced and suitable for people who might be a little intimidated by coding or statistics. It's definitely a great place to start, and with only a few hours a week and simple pointed assignments, it was a soft re entry for me into the academic world. "
10771,good but i thought it will cover most of SAS technology. But it has covered basics only . 
10772,Amazing Course!
10773,Awesome
10774,Great course. 
10775,A great idea to create a project based online course. We should focus on application based learning not on lectures. You need improve this course still. 4 weeks are to short.We need more deep and more weeks.
10776,"Great course, teaching end-to-end on how to select data, prep it up, analyse data using SAS/Python and create custom visualizations. The project based course makes it more enjoyable as students can quickly apply the principles presented in each week's videos. The resources to learn Python and SAS may not be make you a star programmer (since this is not a programming course), but are more than adequate to get a newbie learn enough to process data and work effectively. Definitely recommend to anyone to get an excellent head-start on data analysis from a business and academic research perspective."
10777,"This is the best Course and Specialization I attended ever in my life. The way of presentation, the content(examples and detail) are really amazing. This is the course that any layman can understand. I would recommend to anyone who would like to understand and work on Data Analysis. Hats-off to the Profs and team. You did a fabulous Job. Thank you!! "
10778,I recommend this course for every beginner in data science.
10779,Great course !!!
10780,Very nice course with introduction to Data analysis!
10781,Excellent course. I do recommend this course for anyone who is interested in analytics.

I am looking for a new Data Scientist career (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications. The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructors.
10799,"Great course, clear introduction to concepts and code"
10800,Good classes for learning SAS
10801,"It is a good beginners course but I think there are better lessons in SAS and Python if learning these is your goal, and the content in data cleaning and visual analysis is very basic. "
10802,Very nice course! Good starting point of learning SAS!
10803,Very easy and very helpful course
10804,Good Course simplistic way in explaining core concepts
10805,"The professor and instructors don't understand how to properly write SAS programs and ignored constructive feedback. It's very sad to see students follow suit by producing hard to read codes, ignoring programming conventions. As an analytic leader in healthcare industry (I am supervising some of my junior level team members to get some basic training), I want to say something to the students graduated from this course: if you program the same way as being taught, you will lose a competitive advantage during job interview."
10806,wonderful study experience???
10807,"A fantastic course for beginners, and an extremely useful tool to learn! Recommended for anyone who wants to get started coding or increase their work skills"
10808,"It is a very nice course, although I was expecting something a little deeper / denser on both statistics and SAS programming. It is getting better on Module 2! =)"
10809, Excellent course easy to understand and very practice evaluation 
10810,Nice introductory course to learning both SAS and Python in data analysis! I look forward to taking the next course!
10811,"I appreciate the fact that this course doesn't go into the fine detail on how to code everything, I believe there is still more information on the coding and data management practices that could be included in the course content. In addition to that, I feel the course could use the following adjustments to make it better:1 - Have Python students grade other Python students and SAS students grade other SAS students. While it is nice to get exposure to another language, it is more than enough to learn one at a time.2 - Add quizes and/or other well formed questions that are graded (automatically, not peer graded) to help enforce the concepts being taught.3 - Make the assignment instructions/expectations more clear. I feel there are times when the grading criteria don't exactly match the requested assignment. While people follow the spirit of the assignment, the grading questions may ask for slightly different or additional items.4 - Certain aspects of statistical analysis are glossed over and should be covered in more depth in the training videos. While I like the short videos for brevity, I would prefer to watch 10-15 minutes more content and really feel like the material was well covered."
10812,"I think the course is wonderful for beginners. For somebody trying to learn this on her own, I found this course extremely helpful and easy to grasp. "
10813,Great way to get started in this field!
10814,It is too small and shallow. Whole specialization is actually one full course split into 4 tiny parts.
10815,"Great! Easy to follow, very well video lecture, and very useful!"
10816,Great
10817,Choosing an actual research question allows you to find a topic of interest. This makes the content more meaningful and accelerates understanding of the concepts.
10818,"There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions. In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code. This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before. "
10819,"It was good overall, some of the course materials were a bit sparse. You had to do your own research into getting packages working in spyder etc. I'd probably recommend that learners learn some python separately and read the docs for pandas."
10820,The course videos are fantastic
10821,Well done. Thank you.
10822,Awesome course. Thanks Prof.
10823,"Thank you so much for the course! I liked the research project, it game me a lot of interesting knowledge. I thought in the beginning it is pretty easy course but the last assignment took me a while. "
10824,I saw little interactions between students and in the discussion list. But I liked to learn a new language!
10825,"The course has its positives, but overall does not perform well instructing on the use of the two statistical software offered (SAS &amp; Python). At the beginning they offer multiple data sets to use and formulate a research question, but all the examples utilize only one data set and do not cover the differences you might face with the other data sets - leading to a lot of missed opportunities. Additionally, the tutorials for using the statistical software do not lend themselves towards a thorough understanding and more to a route learning."
10826,"Very good introductory course on managing, subsetting, and manipulating data with SAS or Python."
10827,"The highest video production values of any class I've seen on Coursera so far. Unfortunately, that's the best part of the class; the support is simply nonexistent (a post by someone associated with the staff from a previous run of the course suggests getting help troubleshooting Python from Coursera staff), the instructions for the class software are out of date, the source material for the assignments is sometimes unsuitable to the task you're asked to perform (e.g. statistical analysis on a data set aggregated from disparate sources), and the pretty videos are at times completely unrelated to the actual assignments (the very first week with the literature review). Dropping this specialization like a hot coal; it looked quite promising, but the aggravation over the poor organization and lack of support considerably outweighs anything I could get out of it."
10828,Very nice lecture videos and explanations! Totally worth it
10829,"The course is a very good introduction to Python for data exploration and management. That being said, it focuses too much on categorical data analysis, and I felt the transition to quantitative/continuous data was not very well done.Moreover, some more explanations about several Python functions or coding choices could be better explained.But it's encouraging to see this type of statistical course for Python and not R!! Again!"
10830,Great course! Perfect for starting in analysis of data
10831,The slides are excellent and instructions are clear and to the point. But that point is very limited. The main negative about this class is that there is absolutely no student/TA/teacher feedback and you're pretty much on your own learning. 
10832,"I have never used SAS. I have done minimal statistics and my major in university was Sociology, which I did 20 years ago. So needless to say, I don't remember much. This course was easy to understand and was structured in a way to build upon knowledge from one week to the next. "
10833,Great step to learn data analysis in SAS! 
10834,"They put a lot of effort into this course, but especially for the videos it was a bit too much. So many different visual backgrounds, sounds, music, text floating it... It's as if they just wanted to use everything, while never thinking about when it would start being too distracting."
10835,Beautifully designed course. Really helps me understand basic data analysis and improve reporting skills. 
10836,Good Learning experience and loved the way of teaching.
10837,excellent course especially for those interested into playing with data
10838,This course quite help to get as much reliable data as possible for any survey. 
10839,Excellent review of relevant material. 
10840,Good knowledge about Non-responses!
10841,"While this course seems to have potential, there are many aspects of it that don't result in a great learning experience. The course resources comprise of videos and notes. The videos are informative but the notes are fairly lacking. Perhaps the biggest issue that I found with this course was the disconnect between the material covered in the videos and that which was tested on the quizzes. Often times the quiz questions were either painfully easy or worded in such a way that was not verifiable in any of the class resources. As a result, confusion occurred sometimes more often than true learning. A topic such as missing data is naturally very complex and I wouldn't expect a short course on Coursera to be able to adequately cover it. However, I do think that a lot more could be done to improve the value of this course even if that means changing the scope of the materials. Also, the lack of responsiveness to issues raised on the forum and issue-reporting buttons was a disappointment."
10842,"The contents of this course could be interesting, but they end up being terribly boring. The course lacks examples to bring things to life. A pity!"
10843,it is very informative
10844,"The quality of the presentation is very low, and way below the quality in other courses. The assignments are very poorly designed. This is not a subjective personal experience. This is based on discussions with other learners in the forum who have expressed disappointment and frustration."
10845,"I was interested in the topic. The course itself seems like just a starting point with understanding dealing with missing data. I wanted to know more and see more examples than the videos offered. I also would have appreciated including examples from more than just R, though I did appreciate the minimal discussion of other statistical software that are available for statistical analysis when it did occur."
10846,"I wrote some indepth feedback, but par for the course, I can't save it - either here or on the discussion board. Nothing obscene, but certainly some major frustration with format, inconsistencies in scoring and format, information not reviewed in the course on some of the quizzes, the fact that Coursera keeps trying to sell me the specialty, the lack of ANY moderator on the discussion board to provide assistance...and can go on with the technical issues to but I won't!"
10847,This course quite help to get as much reliable data as possible for any survey. 
10848,Excellent review of relevant material. 
10849,Good knowledge about Non-responses!

10854,Very good course. 
10855,"It was very interesting to go learn what I already know:) through this course. I liked the way it is organized. I got a bit casual with the quizzes but was very serious with the programming assignments. Otherwise I should have secured 100%. But marks or grades aside, it was lovely being busy for the past 4 weeks. I look forward to completing the 2nd course in this Specialization pack.All the instructors were very good. Thank you all so much."
10856,"this is a nice course for beginners, although it does not completed all basic functionality."
10857,"Nice course, but so more unused code in examples"
10858,this course is for very beginner in java or in coding so recommended this course to only those who are beginner otherwise it is good if you loose your hands on programming then to cleanup your hands it's very helpful 
10859,"Excellent pace to review Java. I have dabbled in Java for over a decade, but this course gave me a formal footing esp regarding the strengths of inheritance vs. polymorphism."
10860,nice overview for java
10861,It provides me with exercises to practice but some of the videos explain things awfully or just not at all. Others are good. The discussion boards are helpful. I just wish they didn't talk as much about what something is as opposed to how it works. Many videos often don't show any code or very little which makes understand syntax difficult. 
10862,Great Course
10863,if you're a somewhat experienced programmer looking to start and hand on learn how to build apps this course is not for you. 
10864,Assignments are too good.
10865,Very Nice and easy for a beginner.
10866,"It was quite educating and challenging, it made me explore other coding options and see the importance of commenting my work."
10867,"If you do not already know java (or at least have some experience with it) I would NOT recommend this class. They say all you need to have is very basic computer knowledge (sending emails, opening a browser), but the lectures are taught using acronyms and terms that are not at the beginner level. Even the basic concepts are explained using advanced terms or examples that contain code far beyond a beginners level.They also do not really spend any time going over the programming basics. They discuss them a bit, but they never really give you a bigger picture or really how all the concepts you've learned fit together. There is no real consistency throughout the course, it just seems like they are throwing random concepts at you and hoping you understand. Then they throw you an assignment that requires you to do rather complicated coding (for a true beginner) without any other form of practice before hand.The assignments are also a bit of a mess. All you are really doing is 'filling in the blank'. They give you all this code that has already been written without actually tell you how do to that yourself or what a vast majority of it does and you have to fill in code in a couple places to make it work. But since everything else is written, you can not run the code as you write it to check your work. It will fail because the code is looking for things you haven't written yet. You must write the entire assignment before you can see if the first line of code you wrote works. I find this to be a very poor teaching method. You should be able to check your work as you go, or experiment with different ways of writing things. Instead you are forced to write exactly what they expect."
10868,Thank you!! 
10869,Subtitle files helped me to understand the lessonsand the explanation was well detailed 
10870,"Good course but I think it is better for peaple with some programming background and be prepered for third week, it is lot to do."
10871,"a good course for a very beginner to learn android programing.it covers many useful aspects about java.and this course has demonstrated most of the idea of coding,so you won't get confused by its concept. "
10872,"Excellent course, it helped me reinforce my Java knowledge and learn the basis of Android development through many specialized tasks which I completed easily thanks to the hight quality professors and very detailed lessons."
10873,A great course which covers a lot of practical java!
10874,It is an excellent course for learning Java.
10875,"Excellent course.I learned a lot of things from this course. Thank you so much to Dr. Jerry Roth, Dr. Julie L. Johnson, Michael Walker &amp; Dr. Douglas C. Schmidt for this course."
10876,Great course!
10877,"This is basic course of Java applied not only for Android development. At the beginning of this course you don't need to know anything about java, but step by step you will find out basics and going to know OOP fundamentals. In my opinion third week is the hardest one, but everything is possible to do. Great course."
10878,"Very complete course to learn OOP programing, JAVA and basics on Android Studio IDE."
10879,Very helpful!
10880,Excellent
10881,good lesson
10882,Excellent course. The video lessons were really informative. The assignments given every week were fun to do and also tested your skills. 
10883,Anexceptionally well designed course. Instructors are very helpfull too.
10884,superb!!!
10885,really very useful. i love this course
10886,Simply amazing
10887,amazing experience.I love this course and I am absolutely satisfied with my choice.
10888,Pretty much code assignments help to understanding the concepts. Quite good for beginners.
10889,"Really good course! :) I really like all the explanations, even some of them are so fast when speaking the tutor, but all is amazing! "
10890,Excelente curso.
10891,This Course is a Great One! I hope many peoples will improve their knowledge following Vanderbilt University's Courses because of the Professors Great explaining manner!Thank you all
10892,Should just be called 'Introduction of Java for absolute beginners'. I don't recall anything '...for Android' about the coding.Some of the lecturers are so bad at speaking that it's painful to listen to. I really expected better.
10893,Nice Java refresher.
10894,"Recommend this course for people with some coding background. For those never code before, going through this course in 4 weeks can be a very challenging journey. "
10895,Good course. Bad arrangement!
10896,great course
10897,Excelente
10898,"Well done, well explained, good assignments, looking forward to take the second."
10899,I feel I have really solidified my understanding of Java basics for the purposes of learning the Android development platform
10900,This is a great overview of the Java programming language as far as I can tell. I have prior Java experience and I was interested in Android specific aspects of the language.
10901,"As other reviewers have noted, this course is NOT for beginning programmers! (Unless maybe you are a mathematical genius with total recall.) I have a little background in programming, HTML and CSS, but I found this course to be an absolute nightmare. It would be interesting to find out if any of the rave reviews came from real beginners. Most of the problems have already been noted by other reviews, so I will only mention a few that I did not see mentioned. The course requirements should include hardware and software essentials. In particular, the student has no choice but to use Android Studio. If their system is not running a 64bit OS at 2.4 GHz with at least 8 GB of RAM, it can literally take DAYS for Studio to complete the build so that the student can do anything with assignment code. There is a desperate need for a glossary. The course dives in with more acronyms than the military, and assumes the attmpting learner already has a handle on APIs, SDKs, etc., not to mention many other technical terms (interfaces, ...). If I asked the average programmer to evaluate the MT based on comparisons with the Complutensian Polyglot and Codex Alexandricus, the effect would probably be about the same. Another glaring omission for beginners is a battery of exercises for each concept/skill. As for We've organized all these topics into units that represent roughly 4-6 hours of work each, that is absurd! If you multiplied that by 10, it would still be a stretch. I have no doubt about the programming and technical competence of the instructors (though there are some errors in a number of the instructions). And I'm sure they are very nice people who really want others to learn. The root problem seems to be what professional communicators call The Curse of Knowledge -- a syndrome in which a person is so familiar with their subject that they cannot begin to imagine what it is like for someone who is not. My recommendation to a beginner is to look somewhere else. Take a good introductory course in Java before diving into the vastly more complex world of the Android environment. I am not qualified to evaluate the course from the perspective of an experienced programmer, but I have noted that they are frustrated by clutter caused by token attempts to make this a beginner course. My recommendation to the faculty is to completely re-engineer this whole specialization. They should have a separate set of courses truly designed for beginners, and they should get help from qualified instructional designers who specialize in online adult education. (Might not be a bad idea to get the VU English department to review the lecture text as well.) My recommendation to anyone is to never believe anything Coursera tells you about a course. Audit the course BEFORE you pay any money! This is especially important if the course has not actually started. This course started two months late, and I could not get a refund before the course even got under way! After taking nearly 6 months to wade through a little over half the course requirements, I decided to look at the rest of the assignments and project. This removed all doubt that to continue was a hopeless waste of time. So, I decided to end the nightmare, and I'm glad it's over!"
10902,"Really good course, even for someone who is not from the programming background."
10903,Grate Course content and very well explained.
10904,It could done better 
10905,Very brief for java for android should add more details.
10906,This is a good course but there's some flaws (not about knowledge)
10907,Excellent course
10908,"The assignments are challenging and well balanced. The extra provided code adds a good opportunity to see how professional programmers code and the course videos explain all the content clearly and in an organized fashion. Overall, the course is made easy through the videos and the assignments do well to compel good and continuous practice. "
10909,Does a great job in helping you understand Java concepts.
10910,Its learning curve is almost vertical.
10911,"Very very bad communication from the teachers. The 2nd MOOC was supposed to start I think 2.5 months ago, it did not start at the time of this review. They did not even bother to post some announcement to let the students know : ok course starts in x months.Making things worse, you cannot get a refund if you purchased the entire thing."
10912,excellent course - Mustafa &amp; Ed
10913,Very well
10914,Its a solid java class that has almost 0 android learning. If you are expecting any kind of Android related learning. you will get none this is 100% a java class that just runs in the android environment. 
10915,"The best course that I have taken before, I love the material smooth and clear, easy to keep in mind and understand! highly recommended"
10916,very interesting course for beginners and wannabe app developers 
10917,I should say that this course is the best for beginner learner requirement
10918," This course wasn't well suited to me, being a person with a programming background. It was too introductory. But that doesn't say anything against the course. The reason I don't rate the course highly is that it just wasn't that coherent. I would have preferred to have a single, consistently good instructor. "
10919,"It's a good course, but you do need programming experience. Also, takes twice as much time as they say, at least. Also, third week of course has a lot of work, while fourth week has very little. Would be nice to balance them out. I did get a lot out of the course and plan to continue with this specialization."
10920,"Awesome content, all the requiered foundations for the real beginning in the Android world."
10921,Course was really good.If someone is not having any coding experience then also he can learn with the help of these courses.
10922,"A useful course, with clear explanations of the main features of Java programming language and Object Oriented Programming. I found the teachers competent and I liked the approach of the course, especially aimed at understanding the logic of Java and the logic of good software development.Finally I found very useful peer review assessments."
10923,"I loved this intro to Android. It was a great refresher on Java and gave a peek into the Android framework that is intimidating, but makes me want to learn more!"
10924,"First time I gave 1 star. Reason, lecturers are terrible. This deserves a report, if there was adequate reporting system on Coursera. I had a feeling like I was watching professors from school for disabled, and not an university. . . Course material is actually decent, but extremely badly presented. Sadly, I enrolled into second course as well, and hoping that one will be better, so I wont have to go through refund hell."
10925, Very Helpful 
10926,"It is told that to take this course, basic computer skills like sending emails and downloading files are necessary-this is a beginning level course. Then, in the first module, instructors talk about polymorphism, inheritance and abstraction. For someone who have no prior programming experience, these are definitely not suitable topics to start with. Moreover, students are supposed to learn these concepts to get a good grade from first quiz, although they know nothing about programming.I had some programming experience, so I was already familiar with these subjects. But the lectures were too boring to keep watching. I watched like 10 videos and learned nothing about the course subject. I think I won't be spending my time for this course, which seems to me like reading some reference files."
10927,Excellent Course. 
10928,"Basing on the first videos, I would not recommend this course to anyone believing that You are expected have basic computer literacy skills, such as knowing how to send &amp; receive emails and browse the web. The lector is robotic, the slides look outdated, listener is bored after 10 min of watching. I definitely WOULD NOT pay for this course. I will change the rate after I watch more videos, but this course is a big no-no for me."
10929,Too little detail but nice course as an idea.
10930,Great course material
10931,"I wouldn't recommend this to student who has never programmed in any computer language before. A bright, aggressive, student could learn this material with help of online examples, etc. The basic language features, etc, are pretty straight forward, but the object oriented features are probably too advanced for someone 3 weeks into programming. As an experienced programmer in other languages (C++ / Python / Perl) I found it was about the right pace to do in addition to my real job, and am looking forward to the rest of the series coming online."
10932, I like this course and wants to complete the specialization 
10933,Nice Introductory Course
10934,Very good. By far the best course of android.
10935,Excellent Course!
10936,"I watched the videos and made the assignments without submitting. I was a little bit familiar with Java and Android already, still there were a lot of things I learned, and there were a lot of confusions in my head clarified with this MOOC. "
10937,Great Course as a first step course in android world
10938,"Learn Java first, as they go through it at an agile pace."
10939,very good introduction to java for android.
10940,"The course doesn't allow access to the quizzes unless you pay for it. I consider this to be contradictory with the statement that the free version of the course gives you access to all the material. Also, not being able to take the quizzes makes the course meaningless. "
10941,The best website to learn just about everything! 
10942,The course is very well structured and instructors are very responsive in the forum.
10943,Very lengthy
10944,superb
10945,"Now that I have completed the course I'd like to give some feedback on how I think it was.1. Quizzes are horrible. The fact we get no feedback on incorrect answers is not very helpful. There are only 3 quizzes where I missed just one question but no matter what, I can't get them correct. It would be helpful if there was some explanation why an answer your selected was wrong, a hint or something. Also while some of the quiz answers are obvious from watching the lessons, some are totally not and if someone doesn't have ANY programming experience I think they would find some questions almost impossible to answer. I have a programming background and out of all the quizzes I just missed 1 question on 3 of them, but I've been trying to answer them again, and again, and again and I just can't get them right. If there was feedback after taking a quiz I'm sure it would of helped. For those 3 quizzes, I took them so many times all the other answers are memorized and I just keep trying to get that one right. It's not helpful and then it turns into a just keep selecting different things until it's right thing instead of understanding it.2. The course says it's for beginners to programming but I beg to differ. I think the way the material is presented and how the assignments are laid out I do not think someone(or not many people) would have gotten through that Week two ascii assignment. I thought they assignments in some cases were harder than the lessons. Maybe it's because they way they were explained in the lessons which brings me to #33. I do not think the instructors use the best/most clear examples to present the material to students. There are many easier examples to teach about looping than showing an Ascii art example. Because not only does the student have to grasp the concept of loops, then also have to think about ascii print logic. I think to someone with no experience would get pretty lost pretty quickly in this course. Some of the things explained in the lessons I would actually look up other videos of other people explaining it to get a clearer picture.4. Some material is not consistent. Like in some assignments the text is wrong, for the Account code example, you never really mention the mOut or the interface the class uses which are in the example files and what to do with them when you write the other constructors (The course goes over this later when talking about the constructors and calling a constructor from another constructor but not that early on when you're working with the Account example files5. It seems this course really isn't fully developed yet and is still going through it's growing painsOverall, I would say there are many other courses that are far better at teaching the basics of Java. For me, since I do have some Java experience and a programming background it wasn't too bad, But I'm thinking of the guy who has never touched a line of code before. I just don't think the course does a good enough job at explaining things to someone like that.I really hope the next courses in the specialization are better organized than this because starting with the next course because the next ones are more important to me than this course was only because of my prior background"
10946,Content was good. But organization could have been better. Assignments and auto-grader had issues and the problem statements were modified during the course. 
10947,"I feel this course was severely misrepresented. This clearly not a beginner level class by any measurement. And the 4-6 hours of expected student involvement is ridiculous. A beginner (NO programming experience) should expect to spend 15 to 20 hours on the first week alone and at least 10 hours for each of the remaining weeks.I have over 25 years of programming experience in Assembly language, Visual Basic, C and C++. I am clearly NOT at the beginner level yet I spent more than 11 hours on the first week, mostly due to trying to download and setup properly for the course. Also, there are over 3 hours of videos in the 1st week plus 3 quizzes and a programming assignment. If anyone spent less than 6 hours on week 1, then that was NOT the first time they took this class.I also am keenly disappointed in the restrictive nature of the assignments/quizzes. Having to type -1*1+11 instead of -i+11 (and you better not have any leading or lagging spaces!!) for instance.Bottom line, I would not recommend this course for anyone wanting to Learn Java for Android Programming unless you already know Java and just want some intro on Android development with Android Studio. And if you are indeed at the beginner level, do yourself a favor and start with introductory courses in Computer Science."
10948,"Good course. First time enrolled course in Coursera. I really enjoyed it. Lots of quiz and weekly assignment kept me busy for 4 weeks. And because of these ( assignment due date), i really learned by forcing myself to complete all in time. Quite tough on week 3, and i watched the videos multiple times and google the subject in order to understand the contents. Take this course, and struggle for 4 weeks. Will not regret. "
10949,"The course is nice, lectures is fine.But assignments is a bullshit. The instructions are uncertain, with typos. There is random number used, and you have to do magic with your algorithm in order to match expected output. I strongly dislike it. "
10950,"I liked the course contents, but in my opinion the slides should be more modern, and the main idea in each lesson should get more highlight, and the ideas to retain too. "
10951,"I am relatively experienced programmer trying to just understand the Android app development framework and solve some interesting challenges along the way. I feel the course, was very painstaking in terms of code reviewing other people's work.If I were to break up the time I spent doing the course work, it would be as follows:30 % useful work70 % taking care of course logistics (code review, writing comments on every line of code just so that people being asked to review my work are happy). Why do we have to do so many code reviews? Not every assignment requires people's coding style to be evaluated. It places an unnecessary time burden on people who are taking this course not as full time student. Its also reducing the total amount of knowledge that is being disseminated. We should be learning about Android for 4 more hours rather than reviewing code for other people for 4 more hours.The thing I found most frustrating is that the assignments are trying to force a particular coding style on everyone. Since I am an experienced programmer, I understand the importance of coding style, creating functions and all that. However, how I structure my code and how many comments I write are entirely my choice.Now, while I understand that the course material itself does not ask you to structure code one way or another; the review guidelines that are being given to some very inexperienced programmers, makes them believe that this is the only way things should be done. Its a subtle form of style enforcement which I did not appreciate."
10952,Java for Android was everything I expected. The lectures and assignments were very clear. The instructors and mentors were very helpful. I am looking forward to the next class.
10953,Excellent course for Java begiiner.
10954,Very nice course for beginners
10955,Excelent!!!
10956,Good course!!. the approach is well-balanced (no superficial and at the same time not too much professional). The quiz are done very well.
10957,"Good course in general but it could use more exercises and solutions for those exercises. It could be a great course in futureAlso, sometimes it's confusing like you are asked to download code and write it along with the video but the files already (at least partially) contain the code that you should write and it looks quite different from the video. "
10958,"Excellent Course! Learning Java, Android and also to think differently, will open your mind to think of different methods to implement and create applications."
10959,This course is the best
10960,"Good course on Java and OOP, Android it's a sort of pretext, but it's ok"
10961,"A good introduction to java programming, the mentor team was really helpful and interactive and it was a pleasure to interact with them!Unfortunately, it is clear that this course still needs to be polished: some assignments contained mistakes or where even bugged. Mistakes and bugs have been fixed when they were reported but it still left an amateur aftertaste (especially considering that we had to wait for a few weeks for this course)."
10962,Nice preparation to Java.
10963,Well organized and resourceful. Just what I was looking for.
10964,"If you want to learn about android programming then don't wait, just enroll the course."
10965,Al ot more challenging then i thought. Once i managed my time a bit better it was very engaging
10966,"i gave this course 1 star not because its bad in content, its just because i was expecting more due to the fact it has been delayed several times; then when it finally came it was like any other youtube or online tutorial. i was expecting something as big as udacity but unfortunately its not. Don't expect to know or understand java with this course, no practical or step by step example in this course. what makes it worst is the fact they never show you how to build an app from scratch while the only app they have in this course, they dont do it. you have to do it on your own. dont get me wrong. all of them are good instructors but the way they did it, its definitely is not a beginner friendly. give a calculator as an assignment to build while you never built one app in this course, i think its not an effective way to teach. i will not pay for this specialization. i will do the udacity nanodegree one"
10967,Excellent introduction to the world of Android. Crisp and well-delivered lectures. 
10968,Great!!
10969,The Assignment questions are unclear due to which a lot of time has to be invested.
10970,Ist Week is very informative and explanatory. I am very much excited for next week.
10971,Quite basic and clear for JAVA beginners
10972,Fantastic course... 
10973,v good
10974,good
10975,Awesome Course!
10976,"It's about 4.4 actually. Not enough to give 5 though.First about positive sides. I think course is well structured (except for a few minor drawbacks), quizzes fit to the material. An assignments truly buck up the material. And I think material give a grounding in future Android Development.But I think it can be problem with the learning process, mostly with programming assignment. I think it's common that when course come out for the first time it's almost inevitably that there are some issues with autograder. It' s just common. But these issue are usually easy to spot, because the output of autograder contains test cases. So one can easily find out what the problem is, if it's with autograder. As for this course, the autograder output is very minimalistic, and if the problem is with autograder it's rather hard to spot. I myself spent entire evening, trying to find what is wrong with my code, and it was pure luck that I finely spotted the problem (and, yes, it was autograder issue). Such thing could be very frustrating, really. Another problem with programming assignments is about Peer Review. The students actually get access to assessment criteria, after they have submitted they code. And their code not necessary fit these criteria. I think it could spoil the learning process as well.I actually aware that these drawbacks can be corrected in release course, and if they will be, I will be glad to change the rating."
10977,The content is very rich!
10978,Very good course. 
10979,"It was very interesting to go learn what I already know:) through this course. I liked the way it is organized. I got a bit casual with the quizzes but was very serious with the programming assignments. Otherwise I should have secured 100%. But marks or grades aside, it was lovely being busy for the past 4 weeks. I look forward to completing the 2nd course in this Specialization pack.All the instructors were very good. Thank you all so much."
10980,"this is a nice course for beginners, although it does not completed all basic functionality."
10981,"Nice course, but so more unused code in examples"
10982,this course is for very beginner in java or in coding so recommended this course to only those who are beginner otherwise it is good if you loose your hands on programming then to cleanup your hands it's very helpful 
10983,"Excellent pace to review Java. I have dabbled in Java for over a decade, but this course gave me a formal footing esp regarding the strengths of inheritance vs. polymorphism."
10984,nice overview for java
10985,Great Course
10986,"It was quite educating and challenging, it made me explore other coding options and see the importance of commenting my work."
10987,"If you do not already know java (or at least have some experience with it) I would NOT recommend this class. They say all you need to have is very basic computer knowledge (sending emails, opening a browser), but the lectures are taught using acronyms and terms that are not at the beginner level. Even the basic concepts are explained using advanced terms or examples that contain code far beyond a beginners level.They also do not really spend any time going over the programming basics. They discuss them a bit, but they never really give you a bigger picture or really how all the concepts you've learned fit together. There is no real consistency throughout the course, it just seems like they are throwing random concepts at you and hoping you understand. Then they throw you an assignment that requires you to do rather complicated coding (for a true beginner) without any other form of practice before hand.The assignments are also a bit of a mess. All you are really doing is 'filling in the blank'. They give you all this code that has already been written without actually tell you how do to that yourself or what a vast majority of it does and you have to fill in code in a couple places to make it work. But since everything else is written, you can not run the code as you write it to check your work. It will fail because the code is looking for things you haven't written yet. You must write the entire assignment before you can see if the first line of code you wrote works. I find this to be a very poor teaching method. You should be able to check your work as you go, or experiment with different ways of writing things. Instead you are forced to write exactly what they expect."
10988,Thank you!! 
10989,"Good course but I think it is better for peaple with some programming background and be prepered for third week, it is lot to do."
10990,"a good course for a very beginner to learn android programing.it covers many useful aspects about java.and this course has demonstrated most of the idea of coding,so you won't get confused by its concept. "
10991,"Excellent course, it helped me reinforce my Java knowledge and learn the basis of Android development through many specialized tasks which I completed easily thanks to the hight quality professors and very detailed lessons."
10992,"Excellent course.I learned a lot of things from this course. Thank you so much to Dr. Jerry Roth, Dr. Julie L. Johnson, Michael Walker &amp; Dr. Douglas C. Schmidt for this course."
10993,Great course!
10994,"This is basic course of Java applied not only for Android development. At the beginning of this course you don't need to know anything about java, but step by step you will find out basics and going to know OOP fundamentals. In my opinion third week is the hardest one, but everything is possible to do. Great course."
10995,"Very complete course to learn OOP programing, JAVA and basics on Android Studio IDE."
10996,Very helpful!
10997,Excellent course. The video lessons were really informative. The assignments given every week were fun to do and also tested your skills. 
10998,Anexceptionally well designed course. Instructors are very helpfull too.
10999,amazing experience.I love this course and I am absolutely satisfied with my choice.
11000,Pretty much code assignments help to understanding the concepts. Quite good for beginners.
11001,Excelente curso.
11002,This Course is a Great One! I hope many peoples will improve their knowledge following Vanderbilt University's Courses because of the Professors Great explaining manner!Thank you all
11003,Should just be called 'Introduction of Java for absolute beginners'. I don't recall anything '...for Android' about the coding.Some of the lecturers are so bad at speaking that it's painful to listen to. I really expected better.
11004,"Recommend this course for people with some coding background. For those never code before, going through this course in 4 weeks can be a very challenging journey. "
11005,great course
11006,"Well done, well explained, good assignments, looking forward to take the second."
11007,I feel I have really solidified my understanding of Java basics for the purposes of learning the Android development platform
11008,Grate Course content and very well explained.
11009,This is a good course but there's some flaws (not about knowledge)
11010,"The assignments are challenging and well balanced. The extra provided code adds a good opportunity to see how professional programmers code and the course videos explain all the content clearly and in an organized fashion. Overall, the course is made easy through the videos and the assignments do well to compel good and continuous practice. "
11011,"Very very bad communication from the teachers. The 2nd MOOC was supposed to start I think 2.5 months ago, it did not start at the time of this review. They did not even bother to post some announcement to let the students know : ok course starts in x months.Making things worse, you cannot get a refund if you purchased the entire thing."
11012,very interesting course for beginners and wannabe app developers 
11013," This course wasn't well suited to me, being a person with a programming background. It was too introductory. But that doesn't say anything against the course. The reason I don't rate the course highly is that it just wasn't that coherent. I would have preferred to have a single, consistently good instructor. "
11014,"It's a good course, but you do need programming experience. Also, takes twice as much time as they say, at least. Also, third week of course has a lot of work, while fourth week has very little. Would be nice to balance them out. I did get a lot out of the course and plan to continue with this specialization."
11015,"Awesome content, all the requiered foundations for the real beginning in the Android world."
11016,Course was really good.If someone is not having any coding experience then also he can learn with the help of these courses.
11017,"A useful course, with clear explanations of the main features of Java programming language and Object Oriented Programming. I found the teachers competent and I liked the approach of the course, especially aimed at understanding the logic of Java and the logic of good software development.Finally I found very useful peer review assessments."
11018,"I loved this intro to Android. It was a great refresher on Java and gave a peek into the Android framework that is intimidating, but makes me want to learn more!"
11019, Very Helpful 
11020,Excellent Course. 
11021,"I wouldn't recommend this to student who has never programmed in any computer language before. A bright, aggressive, student could learn this material with help of online examples, etc. The basic language features, etc, are pretty straight forward, but the object oriented features are probably too advanced for someone 3 weeks into programming. As an experienced programmer in other languages (C++ / Python / Perl) I found it was about the right pace to do in addition to my real job, and am looking forward to the rest of the series coming online."
11022,Excellent Course!
11023,Content was good. But organization could have been better. Assignments and auto-grader had issues and the problem statements were modified during the course. 
11024,"Good course. First time enrolled course in Coursera. I really enjoyed it. Lots of quiz and weekly assignment kept me busy for 4 weeks.

11029,Nice preparation to Java.
11030,"The content was very useful, and the preparation of the course denoted much care and preparation by the teacher. I would love to see some modern topics like word embeddings covered in the course!"
11031,Useful as introductory course on NLP. Recommended for anyone who wants to begin on this discipline.
11032,Nice course on text mining.
11033,"A really interesting course which covers theoretically most of the text mining techniques. I missed having more practical exercise, which could help to deeply understand the lectures. Setting up the environment for the development task is a little bit complicated, it might be interesting to provide a virtual machine with all the software and correct versions required. Even though, I would recommend this course if you are interested on the topic."
11034,Awesome!
11035,The content is really good but the course has too much theory. Mixing it with some practical programming assignments would have been very nice
11036,"I think the course has very limited practical problems; so for beginners in NLP and text analytics, it is very difficult to grasp all the theoretical concepts presented in the course."
11037,While I did not do the assignments. The videos and explanations included were top notch!
11038,Nice course and all the chapters are well explained.
11039,"I need it ,I like it."
11040,Very good course thank you I wish we could have use case applications with high level tools such as RThanks a lot again !
11041,This is a very good course. I think it provides a very good foundation of text mining and analytics like PLSA and LDA. More advanced research discussed in the last lecture is also very interesting.
11042,"Annoyingly, the specific pre-requisites can't be determined until AFTER enrolling. This course is in C++, so if you're not a C++ programmer, it's probably not a good idea to purchase this."
11043,"Excellent course, the pipeline they propose to help you understand text mining is quite helpful. It has an important introduction to the most key concepts and techniques for text mining and analytics. "
11044,"The material of the course is very well organized, and presented. The examples and application use cased are interesting and clearly demonstrated. With Machine Learning background, it is very easy to understanding and grasp the theories, the althorithms and put them into practice. I highly recommend this course to anyone who has a ML background and would like to work on NLP problems."
11045,Very interesting! Thank you prof.
11046,"This course is a pretty good resource for full-time graduates who are doing research in Natural Language Processing, but not for other people who want to learn in part-time some concrete skills to resolve specific text mining problems.The course-style is heuristic-guiding based. Some questions are presented in lecturing or quiz, and answers are hardly found. So, some text books had better be specified.Homework of this course is quiz-based, only one optional programming task. It's easy to pass the course, but it's hard to master its content. As an application science area, more practical assignments should be provided, as can help students learn better.This is a 6-week open course teaching a complicated research area, Natural Language Processing, so most of its topic cannot be discussed in detail. However, this course could be designed and organized better."
11047,Could not understand many of the mathematical formulae involved. The topic coverage was good.
11048,Best NLP course that I saw.
11049,loved all the lectures
11050,Great!!
11051,Very comprehensive introduction to text mining. It serves well as a First Class to text mining and analytics!
11052,"I would recommend this course to everyone who wants to know much more about theoric part of text mining. For pratices, I'd recommend the data camp courses... I think the join of this platforms, could result in a better experience, because you can pratice the theorical knowledge gained here, regards =) !"
11053,"the course is very helpful in giving the overall flavor of text mining and analytics. I would recommend to reduce the number of math work and focus on the conceptual level along with more application that could be used. For the math part, adding optional videos for more details about math will be very useful and helpful"
11054,"Forums were poorly organized and not well participated in. There was no forum topic for the honors assignment.Honors assignment appeared to require unix, which was not stated in the course requirements.Honors assignment was due too early in the term."
11055,This was a great introduction to Text Mining and Analytics. 
11056,"This is an excellent course that captures many different text mining techniques. It requires some math knowledge in numerical analysis and probability in order to understand the concepts. I gave 4 star rating due to 2 problems during the course: 1) Lack of examples along the formulas and principles. There are some, but many concepts could be adopted much faster if examples were introduced right along with them. 2) The optional programming exercises are easy to complete, but the environment is very confusing to set it up. "
11057,"Too much theory, not enough practical exercises and too few examples of how the algorithms work."
11058,The coding assignment instructions are near impossible to follow. The lecture is monotonous in the later weeks. 
11059,Good survey of techniques
11060,Excellent Module! A most know &amp; understand unit for all students of Data Science. Enjoyed every aspect of the learning .. Good teaching !!!
11061,The course focuses more on the theoretical side with no practical examples. It also does not explain these theoretical concepts in detail enough. It was difficult for me as a new learner in the text analytics field to follow such dense theoretical concepts.
11062,Very good course! Thank you :)
11063,Very practical. The lecture is easy to follow. 
11064,"Very detailed, but taught in an easily understandable manner. "
11065," You need to pay to participate in the quizzes. Stay clear, there are free alternatives out there "

Tim Roughgarden is an incredible teacher/instructor, the material is excelent and the assignements are challenging yet very useful and engaging. Funny how this course made me wish going back to college even at my age. Will definetely follow up with similar courses if I can find them in Coursera. "
11090,Thoroughly enjoyed this course! Problems and assignments are quite challenging but doable
11091,"Very challenging, well presented. "
11092,This challenging course improves understanding of algorithms and is intellectually stimulating. I learnt the theory behind algorithms and how they are applied to solve real world problems.
