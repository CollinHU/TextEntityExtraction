2,"Redundant, poor explanations and a complete lack of examples about the general concepts and the foundations of this discipline. The interaction between the teacher and the slides is limited to a reading exercise that does not provide any add value at all. Very dissapointed and still wondering if this course is worth my attention -and extremely limited time- or not. Plenty of room for improvement.","{'explan': ['explanations'], 'lack': ['lack'], 'exampl': ['examples'], 'concept': ['concepts'], 'foundat': ['foundations'], 'teacher': ['teacher'], 'slide': ['slides'], 'read exercis': ['reading exercise'], 'add valu': ['add value'], 'cours': ['course'], 'attent': ['attention'], 'time': ['time'], 'plenti': ['Plenty'], 'room': ['room'], 'improv': ['improvement']}"
3,"I have sat through 4 of the lessons and I am not very impressed. I fell that the topic is very interesting, but the professor does not do a very good job explaining the algorithms. It may be because I do no have the textbook, but overall a rather poor course. There need to be a little more explanation beyond the slides.","{'topic': ['topic'], 'professor': ['professor'], 'job': ['job'], 'cours': ['course'], 'explan': ['explanation'], 'slide': ['slides']}"
