241,It's a great course with lots of insight into spark. At first it's confusing - first rdds; then dataframes and later datasets. But this is by no means the instructors' fault. Heather greatly describes in detail what goes on under the hood and why dataframes are way faster than simple rdds and why we have to give up some of our beloved typesafety of scala-land to let catalyst do its magic. Datasets try to bring some of it back. I really enjoyed coding the assignments. Took me ~2hrs each. The tasks were fun and like those you would find in the wild.I already applied some of the skills I learned here at work and successfully implemented a simple recommendation engine that will go to production next week.Highly recommend this course!,"{'cours': ['course'], 'lot': ['lots'], 'insight': ['insight'], 'rdds': ['rdds'], 'datafram': ['dataframes'], 'dataset': ['Datasets', 'datasets'], 'instructor': ['instructors'], 'fault': ['fault'], 'heather': ['Heather'], 'detail': ['detail'], 'way': ['way'], 'typesafeti': ['typesafety'], 'scala-land': ['scala-land'], 'catalyst': ['catalyst'], 'magic': ['magic'], 'assign': ['assignments'], 'task': ['tasks'], 'fun': ['fun'], 'skill': ['skills'], 'work': ['work'], 'recommend engin': ['recommendation engine'], 'product': ['production'], 'week.high': ['week.Highly']}"

It was amazing how Dr. Miller used concepts that were meticulously built up in the earlier courses, such as evaluation strategy, functional collections, reactive programming, and associativity, to describe the core of Spark in only four units. As someone coming from more of a statistics background, I started this specialization only to learn Spark, so I wasn't always sure how relevant learning the more theoretical underpinnings of Scala would be. It turns out that it was pretty essential, while also just making me a better programmer.
