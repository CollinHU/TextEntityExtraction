Since 2014 when the videos and lectures were written, the frameworks have advanced and become incompatible with the lessons.

Notice that multiplatform in this case means iOS and Android no Windows Phone and you do get a bit of hands on work on Android SDK and XCode, although mostly for setting up both environments. Professor Muppala is again outstanding in the class, covering a wide range of topics combined with multiple exercises which in my case really furthered my understanding. One thing I believe could improve would be having either at least one assignment forcing you to deploy to Android and another one to iOS. In my case, it was just too comfortable to simply deploy to an iOS device and barely look at Android. Also, the vibration function should not be part of an assignment, as not everyone will have a device to test it and neither of the emulators really use it.

194,Good course!!!,{'cours': ['course']}
195,A massive thanks to Prof. Muppala - this course provides a very gentle and easy to access entry into the world of app development. I tried to get into Android Studio and Xcode before and was overwhelmed by both - taking this approach made it a lot easier for me to get started and the course layout especially in conjunction with the previous course about AngularJS provided me with just the right tools and concepts at the right time and pace!,"{'thank': ['thanks'], 'prof. muppala': ['Prof. Muppala'], 'cours': ['course'], 'access entri': ['access entry'], 'app develop': ['app development'], 'android studio': ['Android Studio'], 'xcode': ['Xcode'], 'approach': ['approach'], 'lot': ['lot'], 'cours layout': ['course layout'], 'angularj': ['AngularJS'], 'right tool': ['right tools'], 'concept': ['concepts'], 'time': ['time'], 'pace': ['pace']}"

217,I took the initial offering of this courser. It is an excellent class that I am sure will only improve over time. Prof. Muppala is a wonderful instructor and I learned so much in this course. My only suggestion would be to clarify some of the grading details as there were some questions on certain items in the last assignment. I would definitely recommend this series of courses and I am looking forward to taking the final course in this Full Stack Web Development series.,"{'class': ['class'], 'time': ['time'], 'prof. muppala': ['Prof. Muppala'], 'instructor': ['instructor'], 'cours': ['course', 'courses'], 'suggest': ['suggestion'], 'detail': ['details'], 'question': ['questions'], 'item': ['items'], 'assign': ['assignment'], 'seri': ['series'], 'web develop seri': ['Web Development series']}"
