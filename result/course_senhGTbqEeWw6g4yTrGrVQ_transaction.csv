12,Option of learning both SAS and Python is great!,"{'option': ['Option'], 'sas': ['SAS'], 'python': ['Python']}"

15,This level of detail was good for easier statistical concepts but there are much better courses on Coursera for Machine Learning,"{'level': ['level'], 'detail': ['detail'], 'concept': ['concepts'], 'cours': ['courses'], 'coursera': ['Coursera'], 'machin learn': ['Machine Learning']}"

17,"Disadvantages Lacks Rigour, Lacks Support from instructors , Expensive , Peer review this is somewhat bad as most barely give any comments, though towards the end, reviews tend to be pretty good DISCLAIMER I am not statistically significant as i only receive 3 reviews per week.

This is probably useful for people wanting to learn techniques for data analysis, who need not go too deep into the technique. I would recommend this to people learning techniques for data analysis in various non-mathematical and non-statistical fields, though the content lacks rigour, and you need outside sources to help understand techniques. This course IS NOT WORTH PAYING USD79, there are definitely other courses much more worth the money. You can audit it for free, if you do not want a cert.

24,"I really liked this course. Concepts well explained.
