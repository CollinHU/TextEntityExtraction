327,The mathematics in this course are at a high level similar to Statistical Inference - and are presented at a pace that is challenging without significant background in the field.

For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better.
