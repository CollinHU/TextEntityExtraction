7,"Week 4 was particularly tough to get through. Instructor seem uninterested, and the constant hair flipping was distracting. Videos came through blurry despite using high quality settings. There was a lot of code to get through that could have been better organized. On a few occasions, I had to back-track through the videos to find something I missed. And, in one area, instructor had to go back and fix something but didn't bother to provide guidance as to were to go and do this yourself. In the end, I gave up following along with the videos and built the app using my own research.","{'week': ['Week'], 'video': ['Videos', 'videos'], 'qualiti set': ['quality settings'], 'occas': ['occasions'], 'guidanc': ['guidance'], 'end': ['end'], 'app': ['app'], 'research': ['research']}"
