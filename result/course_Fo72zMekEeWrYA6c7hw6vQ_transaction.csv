1,Its a tough course but worth it!More in depth details will be much better.Coding Assignments can be explained much better. In this course there is problem in understanding coding assignment details as in some cases they are not explained correctly.,"{'cours': ['course'], 'it!mor': ['it!More'], 'depth detail': ['depth details'], 'better.cod assign': ['better.Coding Assignments'], 'problem': ['problem'], 'assign detail': ['assignment details'], 'case': ['cases']}"

3,An ambitious sweep across the NLP landscape. Requires at least intermediate knowledge of Python; especially the programming assignments are barely doable without advanced debugging skills. Exercises often refer to material not covered in the course up to that point.,"{'sweep': ['sweep'], 'nlp landscap': ['NLP landscape'], 'knowledg': ['knowledge'], 'python': ['Python'], 'program assign': ['programming assignments'], 'debug skill': ['debugging skills'], 'exercis': ['Exercises'], 'materi': ['material'], 'cours': ['course'], 'point': ['point']}"
4,"Although the course seems to be very interesting and cover wide spectrum of NLP subjects, it is full with references to other materials some of them are no longer exist in the location given. Also the programming exercises quite often are detached from the material and also have references to materials that were not covered in lectures accompany them.My advice to author - made lectures and exercises more self-contained. Do not try to cover enormous amount of material during one week. Make exercised to be closely connected to the material given during that week.","{'cours': ['course'], 'cover spectrum': ['cover spectrum'], 'nlp subject': ['NLP subjects'], 'refer': ['references'], 'materi': ['materials', 'material'], 'locat': ['location'], 'program': ['programming'], 'amount': ['amount'], 'week': ['week']}"
