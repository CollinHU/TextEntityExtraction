434,"It is a great privilege to learn neural networks by Prof. Hinton, a giant in the field of neural networks, and I am grateful for that. This course is excellent as a broad introduction to neural networks. Prof. Hinton conveys a lot of intuition and technical details, and for people like me, who has no experience in neural networks sometimes it is difficult to see the forest for the trees.

435,"This course is good, unique and relevant for machine learning today. Some things can be improved though. Starting around weeks 11-12 the lectures become a bit vague, and I had quite some difficulty understanding them. It seemed to me that these lectures were hastily created even though I can only imagine how much work creating this course must have been Furthermore, the lab sessions are rather easy and the provided code is annoying to work with systematically since they output results as printed text instead of something re-usable. This makes experimentation like grid searches a bit tedious. Besides these minor things, the course is quite good.Note that deep learning topics are only briefly touched, but you won't obtain the skills for training and designing them yourself without further exploration of the topics.Finally, many thanks to the teachers!","{'cours': ['course'], 'machin learn': ['machine learning'], 'thing': ['things'], 'week': ['weeks'], 'bit': ['bit'], 'difficulti': ['difficulty'], 'work': ['work'], 'lab session': ['lab sessions'], 'code': ['code'], 'output result': ['output results'], 'text': ['text'], 'someth': ['something'], 'experiment': ['experimentation'], 'topic': ['topics'], 'skill': ['skills'], 'train': ['training'], 'explor': ['exploration'], 'topics.fin': ['topics.Finally'], 'thank': ['thanks'], 'teacher': ['teachers']}"
