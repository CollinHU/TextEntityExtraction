I found it quite flattering that someone who's final submission I had to grade sent in the exact same paper I sent in and provided the same links I provided to an API on areascore.ca which is a domain I own as well as links to repositories in my bitbucket account which I now have made private The only thing that would upset me is this person getting a better grade than I did. ,"{'experi': ['experience'], 'submiss': ['submission'], 'grade': ['grade'], 'paper': ['paper'], 'link': ['links'], 'api': ['API'], 'thing': ['thing'], 'person': ['person']}"
