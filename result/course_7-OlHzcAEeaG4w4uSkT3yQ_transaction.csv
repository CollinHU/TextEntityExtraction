1,Very useful to learn the basics of social media analysis twitter and youtube with python and R.It's a good course to start.,"{'basic': ['basics'], 'media analysi': ['media analysis'], 'python': ['python'], 'cours': ['course']}"
2,"The course material should be provided on coursera itself. Instead of having to download a 1.8GB dataset from yelp, the two files could have been shared here. ",{'coursera': ['coursera']}
3,"A good, basic introduction to Social Media Data Analytics","{'introduct': ['introduction'], 'media data analyt': ['Media Data Analytics']}"
4,"I'd like to give just one star rating for this course, as it is very far from what I expected. The course expect students to know Python, to know R, but did not go deep enough to help students understand the insight from social media data. In fact, lots of R task can be replaced with Python, so the course could be designed in a much better way that students do not always switch between two programming environments. This course mainly teaches how to download data with keywords, and how to plot graph, not worth the effort of learning. Therefore, I would not recommend this course to anyone.","{'star rate': ['star rating'], 'cours': ['course'], 'student': ['students'], 'python': ['Python'], 'insight': ['insight'], 'media data': ['media data'], 'fact': ['fact'], 'way': ['way'], 'program environ': ['programming environments'], 'data': ['data'], 'keyword': ['keywords'], 'graph': ['graph'], 'effort': ['effort'], 'anyon': ['anyone']}"
