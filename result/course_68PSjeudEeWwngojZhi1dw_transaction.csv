27,The course is interesting and you can learn a lot. The professor is very knowledgeable in the area of search engines. However the course goes very early into mathematical details without too much context. The programming assignments are great and I would focus more on them as they really show you how the engine works. ,"{'cours': ['course'], 'lot': ['lot'], 'professor': ['professor'], 'area': ['area'], 'search engin': ['search engines'], 'detail': ['details'], 'context': ['context'], 'program assign': ['programming assignments'], 'engin': ['engine']}"

29,"This is not a class I would normally pursue. I took it as part of the Data Mining certification. That being said, this class was wonderful. I learned the basics of text retrieval and search engines. I went from knowing nothing, to having a working sense of how search engine algorithms work. It was a challenging course for me, but very much worth the time and effort I put into it. It was like pulling back the curtain on the code behind Google, Netflix, and Amazon searches, and that has made me think of the world in a different way.
