0,"Solid introduction with a lot of references. Lot of topics are not deep enough discussed and a lot of additional reading is necessary in order to get a lot out of the course. Furthermore, the presentation style and the language understandability of the lecturer are not very good. Too few exercise questions. Would still recommend it as introduction course and for the high number of good paper references.","{'introduct': ['introduction'], 'lot': ['Lot', 'lot'], 'refer': ['references'], 'topic': ['topics'], 'read': ['reading'], 'cours': ['course'], 'present style': ['presentation style'], 'languag understand': ['language understandability'], 'lectur': ['lecturer'], 'exercis question': ['exercise questions'], 'introduct cours': ['introduction course'], 'number': ['number'], 'paper refer': ['paper references']}"

7,"I'd review this course for two parts lectures and programming assignments.Lectures Prof. Jiawei Han is a pioneer of the subject. However, I was expecting a more indepth elaboration of techniques. In almost all his lectures he covered very crucial topics at a near-shallow level. For someone like me, it was a motivation to be learning the subject from him but I was left disappointed a little bit. I felt if i was just to gain a superficial understanding then I would have browsed through any website blog article rather than paying for this course and coming here under his tutelage. I will not expect him to be as thorough as he'd be in his lectures at UIUC although why not! but a more elaborative explanation with more notable examples instead of pointing to the reading material at the end of 4th minute of the lecture will be more fruitful and a better learning experience.The programming assignments are challenging and will definitely open up the thought process towards being able to imagine what patterns mean and how to go about extracting them.","{'cours': ['course'], 'part': ['parts'], 'program': ['programming'], 'prof. jiawei han': ['Prof. Jiawei Han'], 'pioneer': ['pioneer'], 'subject': ['subject'], 'elabor': ['elaboration'], 'techniqu': ['techniques'], 'topic': ['topics'], 'level': ['level'], 'someon': ['someone'], 'motiv': ['motivation'], 'bit': ['bit'], 'understand': ['understanding'], 'tutelag': ['tutelage'], 'explan': ['explanation'], 'exampl': ['examples'], 'read materi': ['reading material'], 'end': ['end'], 'minut': ['minute'], 'lectur': ['lecture'], 'experience.th program assign': ['experience.The programming assignments'], 'process': ['process'], 'pattern': ['patterns']}"

10,"Really disappointing. The slides contain a lot of paper references that seem to be of high quality that's the reason I'm giving it 2 stars and not just 1 .. but the course itself is bad it covers many algorithms, but so superficially that you learn nothing; and there are not enough programming assignments to really allow you to get any intuition on the concepts.I would love to see this be turned into a 5-course, 30-week specialization in itself and the professor sure looks like he has the knowledge to fill these 30 weeks .. but as a single course over 4 weeks, it's not good.","{'slide': ['slides'], 'lot': ['lot'], 'paper refer': ['paper references'], 'qualiti': ['quality'], 'reason': ['reason']}"
