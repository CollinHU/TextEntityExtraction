0," troubleshooting ad-2500 and ad-2600 no picture scrolling b/w . repost from january 13 , 2004 with a better fit title . does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ? or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ? before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first . no picture : hopefully you still have the remote control . if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it . using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote . the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive . if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd . if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car ! picture scrolling in b/w : you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard . press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote . the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc . by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen . for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips . i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal . im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place . but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! it practically plays almost everything you give it . i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor . for the price it is a well spent investment ! i would recommend buying one . "
1," incredibe price / performance . i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 . this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways . it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set . its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had . it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well . and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom . strengths are well listed by other reviewers . what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) . it sure does ! that 's a rare and valuable feature . i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) ! another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable . at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo . weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] . if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model . update : the finish is more "" mirror "" than silver -- and i like it ! "
2, doesnt play new disney movies . many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player . i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months . 
3," poor quality - problem with dual-layer dvd 's . player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 . for the money , get a better quality player . player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play . i know the saying is "" you get what you pay for "" but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse . will never purchase apex again . customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them . pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas ! "
4," has destroyed several of my dvds and cds . for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised . then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all . new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays . i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media . there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk ! this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it . i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read . i just got screwed out of fifty bucks . apex does n't answer the phone . * sigh . "
5, their customer service sucks . no way to contact their customer service . very bad quality . 
6," great value . i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites . i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him . now i need to buy myself another one ! have used it frequently and have had no problems . i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others . i liked this one enough to buy another . my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money . great quality picture and features . "
7," 2 out of three ai n't good . thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats . i 've bought 3 apex dvd players now . they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them . i am back to using # 1 . nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now . "
8, buy a better known brand name . this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas . the door would not close . i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept . i am still trying to resolve it four months later . 
9," piece of crap .. . it looks great - and is loaded with features . unfortunately it turns out to be the "" disposable "" type . have had problems since the first day - not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it . save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month . "
10," i 've had no problems . the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me . i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it . it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation . it did also seem to have a strong "" new electronics "" smell for some time . the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . "" this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue . the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend . ( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . ) the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting . the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons . i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed . while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way . i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode . the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings . having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying . i have not used the progressive scan feature . this model has come down in price since i purchased mine . while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase . any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support . while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it . "
11," do not buy this piece of junk . i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires . it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do . i can only hear the sound . i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help . i think you get what you pay for stands true . "
12," nice paperweight . i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job . i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked . as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning . do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works . "
13," worst piece of electronics i ever bought . if i could give this a negative rating , i would . i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems . wo n't play a lot of discs . i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap ! some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today . it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten . tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent . amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds ! there should have been a recall on this product . fair warning - do not buy . i repeat - do n't wast your money . "
14," do n't buy ! i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working . one stopped working in february and the other in march . amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return . i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems . "
15," we had problems . the dvd player does not work properly . the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd . this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before . after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support . "
16," ok if you have a 2nd dvd player . i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now . nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have . unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd . i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode . on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd . luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't . unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything . "
17," another person who had problem with picture after one use . i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband . we tried it out christmas night and it worked great . even viewed cds full of jpgs . we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) . but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture . we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks . though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help . they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck . i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone . do not buy this player . who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will . "
18," frustrating just hope you never lose / break the remote for this player ! we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work "" apex "" dvd players and none worked . called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) . if anybody knows of a remote to work this-i 'd love to hear from you ! ( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones ! "
19, poor customer service . i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective . it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced . the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line . i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again . 
20, a piece of junk . door broke after a month . unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs . 3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything . forget about it . it 's money down the drain . get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys . 
21," to quote bart : "" craptacular "" . well , it was nice while it lasted . after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds . as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale . "
22," poor quality . only used for 3 month before it 's down ! i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it ! it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment . the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated . maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures . "
23," returned after failing to play dvds . i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon . as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement . the entire unit was poorly crafted . there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board . after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it . most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition . the dvd player just would't recognize them . it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc . i ended up sending the unit back to amazon . "
24," apex ad2600 . this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature . now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos . but for $ 49.99 go get one ! features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names . "
25, customer service nonexistant . i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed ! i have been trying for over a week to contact apex . they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy . all i am looking for is a rebate form ! 
26," what a buy .. . i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it . i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck . because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's . however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) . the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's . it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video . i find this to be a great feature . i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great . for the money apex machines have good features . you can 't find the mpeg playback on high priced units . it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice . i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy . "
27," avoid apex dvd players - even if they 're free ! i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax . now i know why - they are pieces of junk . less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows "" no disc . "" this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last . my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it . same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing . pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run . "
28," best player for the buck . i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper . the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal . loved the slim design . "
29, black and white only after 1 month of use . this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared . apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy . 
30," most bang for the buck. i recieved my 2600 4 days ago and feel that this may be the best $ 50 i have ever spent . it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up . audio is excellent . well worth the money . "
31," for the price , an excellent buy . after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected . ( good going , amazon ). i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer . so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's . i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks . i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit . the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray . so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit . i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point . but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it . bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player . "
32," excellent second dvd , or first dvd for hdtv ready tv. wow ! simple to use and hook up . comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs . the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used . i also own an "" apex ad 1201 "" dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago . one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent . and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does . friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased . i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name . consider it for a future gift too ! "
33," save your money . this dvd play is basicly junk . it wo n't play all of my movies . keeps coming up with no disk errors . i tried called apex cust service , no help . do n't waste your money . mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs . this is the 4 apex player that i have bought . you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more . each of the 4 lasted less than six months . you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere . spend the money its well worth it . "
34," what a dvd player ! this is the best dvd player i 've purchased . i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed . for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc. this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong . 80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic . having said that , this is what you do . "" add to cart "" ! "" check out "" ! "" enjoy "" ! "
35, apex ad2600 known capadabilty problem . i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) . they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem . i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies . 
36," value for money ! i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player . well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds . it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player . i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player . what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player ? i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit ! hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days . and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does . finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me ! "
37," poor quality dvd player . i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad . the first one would n't work from the start . the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out ! amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com ! i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one . i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy . i will never buy another apex digital product ! "
38," you get what you paid for . for the most part this is a good dvd player . but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments . usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it . annoying . "
39," no picture and / or no sound , try i/p button on the remote . we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working . it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs . there was neither picture nor sound . connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture . the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help . i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control . it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode . obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode . we are overall pleased with product . i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual . "
40, people with video issue 's . i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan . another stupid move . 
41," buyer beware . i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 . it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . ) i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal . i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one ! neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . ) i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info . let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) : "" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again . "
42," barely worked . it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen . i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back . amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ). "
43," has problems reading some dvds. good : progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) . seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) . also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) . output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv . bad : i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) . it would just spin up and stop , and display "" no disc "" . my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units . for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button . you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll . also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 "" tv ). "
44," pretty good . ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know . i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box . i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal . lot 's of other features that i need to find out about . looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors . things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off ! and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck ! "
45," plays pancakes . this thing plays everything i feed it . compusa , memorex , fuji . plays them all . i ordered 2 . "
46," great dvd player . i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself . when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with . easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot . very happy ! "
47," customer service is non-existent ! ! i wish i could give negative stars ! i bought this dvd player in november . i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today . i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one . what a mistake ! after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty . i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing . i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc . i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens . i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable . i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered . i just want to at least try an exchange but you can 't get through to their number , it 's always busy . that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make . do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money ! "
48," keep shopping , do n't stop here . i bought this as a gift for my sister . it has never worked . i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine . i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase . "
49," worst customer service on record . purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it . the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button . the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever . i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again . i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem . they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply . i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response . i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you . once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message . still no response . i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb . "
50," good price , bad product . i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife . 3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze . now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk . have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid . have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through . this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks . i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .

51," stay away from it . i bought this product from amazon . after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd . i can only hear the sound but no picture ! their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor . no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me . "
52," problems . i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price . however , i should have followed my instincts : you get what you pay for . one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing . some dvd 's i rented would not play . now , i suddenly have no picture . i will say this . when the player was working it was great ,but .

53," the second apex - at least it 's prettier than the last . the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated . the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed : i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks . i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ). back to the 2600 : 1 . it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive . 2 . without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen . 3 . excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players . 4 . remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s . anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product . i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one : with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest .

54," does not play dvds with extra features .. . first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed . unlike some of the other people who received a "" lemon "" , my dvd player came in perfect working condition . as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine . what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds . for example , i tried playing my new "" pirates of the carribean "" extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it . at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my "" alias "" dvds as well . this player seems to work fine with everything else . so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them . because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .
