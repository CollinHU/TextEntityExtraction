1,This course was great With good code examples and algorithm applications and also intuition It's a shame that we couldn't finish planned courses due to busy schedules of instructors as I was really looking forward to the capstone project ,"{'cours': ['courses', 'course'], 'intuit': ['intuition'], 'instructor': ['instructors'], 'schedul': ['schedules'], 'project': ['project'], 'code exampl': ['code examples'], 'algorithm applic': ['algorithm applications']}"
2,Nice course with all the practical stuffs and nice analysis about each topic but practical part of LDA was restricted for GraphLab users only which is a weak fallback and rest everything is fine. ,"{'cours': ['course'], 'topic': ['topic'], 'analysi': ['analysis'], 'analysi part': ['analysis part']}"
3,Clustering &amp; Retrieval was a lot tougher compared to courses on regression &amp; classification because the match concepts behind this course were too complex. Nevertheless Emily tried to make this course as intuitive as possible,"{'cluster': ['Clustering'], 'retriev': ['Retrieval']}"

8,The teachers are really amazing. They do not just explain it as if they read a book. They explain the concepts very well,{'concept': ['concepts']}
9,Overall is great. The LDA and Dendrograms lack quality or specificity and depth of the previous topics.
