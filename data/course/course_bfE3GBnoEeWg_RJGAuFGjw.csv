2173,Good basic course. I may have missed it but there was no discussion of libraries or more importantly where to find them until week 3. I keep using 'import xyz' but not really knowing what it was doing. I finally found the library and documentation pages that were talked about in week 03. this seems a good place to actually LOOK at them but I think they should be mention with the first excersise in week 01... here we put in 'import xyz'. this has many many functions in it that allow us to shorten the work that we do. In week 03 we open the documentation file and a library file to see how to navigate those (especially the documentation files),bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.507462686567

2183,"Thank You Bill! Great! Once I got your way of study it was a pleasure to learn. You introduce methods slowly so that it does not intervene with grasping the whole idea of the subject. Submissions needs to be very precise but that is the joy of learning on line. Sometimes you fail as you are missing one space. In terms of certificate, I do not need one and I it is quite expensive but I would surly support your course by donating.

2228,"Pros: I liked the programming examples and problems approach. I learned a lot, and feel confident to use python in future for more complicated scientific computing.cons: The videos were too long, and I found I had all the info in the examples. I would have liked more guidance on how to build up simple structured programmes - the final assignment you have a giant programme already built, whereas you could have set some exercises for split this code into two subroutines that handle different jobs.The autograder was really frustrating (sorry, I know it must be difficult to make something fair and automatic), but the great thing about a compiler or running a program is that you get to see the errors. The autograder just says 3 errors, and the problem turns out to be nothing to do with my program, which already produces the desired output.",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.518292682927

2303,"This course was pretty okay, I'd say. I did learn several new things and consider myself introduced to the world of python. Unfortunately, as a BRAND NEW programmer, it was, at times hard to keep up. There were a number of elements that weren't sufficiently explained during the lessons/assignments (presumably because we 'should' have a basic understanding of coding already...I guess?). If this is the case, some outside study/background research may be necessary, at times. The instructor was actually relatively helpful, though the forum format makes for lag in help time, meaning you could be stuck on a problem or with a question for a while (again...outside study/research required). Overall, as I said, I learned things- yay! This course is for the very patient, however, and may likely by too simplistic for those with programming experience, too difficult for those who have never coded or maybe just right for some lucky few.",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.520833333333

2307,This was great. I had to do some more reading into the videos and spend more time trying to produce output in different formats to learn more. I liked the fact that I could read the comments before watching the video and that they were enough of a primer for the lecture. I wish there would have been a similar problem like the one for the database but one where we would need to write from scratch in order to get used to the different things introduced that week. This was great as it is one of the few that use Python 3 and as a beginner I wanted to learn the new first and then work out the differences later on.

I keep using 'import xyz' but not really knowing what it was doing. I finally found the library and documentation pages that were talked about in week 03. this seems a good place to actually LOOK at them but I think they should be mention with the first excersise in week 01... here we put in 'import xyz'. this has many many functions in it that allow us to shorten the work that we do. In week 03 we open the documentation file and a library file to see how to navigate those (especially the documentation files),bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.507462686567

I learned a lot, and feel confident to use python in future for more complicated scientific computing.cons: The videos were too long, and I found I had all the info in the examples. I would have liked more guidance on how to build up simple structured programmes - the final assignment you have a giant programme already built, whereas you could have set some exercises for split this code into two subroutines that handle different jobs.The autograder was really frustrating (sorry, I know it must be difficult to make something fair and automatic), but the great thing about a compiler or running a program is that you get to see the errors. The autograder just says 3 errors, and the problem turns out to be nothing to do with my program, which already produces the desired output.",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.518292682927

2452,"Definitely a concise introduction. I felt like the course was a little too easy and didn't provide much meat to the material. A good start for an inexperienced programmer, but too remedial for experienced programmers.",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.707317073171
2453,The course is really great to start coding and develop interest in it. The language used is quite simple which makes it easy to understand for almost anyone. Thanks Coursera for the course.,bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.638888888889

2455,"A great soft start into Python. Being used to other programming languages (JS, PHP, a little bit of Java) and comfortable reading online documentation and finding answers in StackOverflow, I found this course very easy to complete within just a few days. Small difficulties with the grader interface at first, solved in the forum. Suggestion: include Python List Comprehension in the course. Dear Bill, thank you very much for the course and support!

2461,"I know it is a lot asked, but would be great if the delivery was a bit more enthusiastic. Also a couple of suggestions to make the learning easier: please do not use loud keyboard when making videos, and please be mindful that some people use single screen to view video and code on the side so if the details on video are very small it becomes quite hard to see what is being written.Thanks, Janis",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.674698795181

2470,"This course was pretty okay, I'd say. I did learn several new things and consider myself introduced to the world of python. Unfortunately, as a BRAND NEW programmer, it was, at times hard to keep up. There were a number of elements that weren't sufficiently explained during the lessons/assignments (presumably because we 'should' have a basic understanding of coding already...I guess?). If this is the case, some outside study/background research may be necessary, at times. The instructor was actually relatively helpful, though the forum format makes for lag in help time, meaning you could be stuck on a problem or with a question for a while (again...outside study/research required). Overall, as I said, I learned things- yay! This course is for the very patient, however, and may likely by too simplistic for those with programming experience, too difficult for those who have never coded or maybe just right for some lucky few.",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.520833333333

2473,Fast and thorough.,bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.75
2474,This was great. I had to do some more reading into the videos and spend more time trying to produce output in different formats to learn more. I liked the fact that I could read the comments before watching the video and that they were enough of a primer for the lecture. I wish there would have been a similar problem like the one for the database but one where we would need to write from scratch in order to get used to the different things introduced that week. This was great as it is one of the few that use Python 3 and as a beginner I wanted to learn the new first and then work out the differences later on. Thumbs up Prof. Boyd and crew!!,bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.540740740741

2500,"a good course, especially as an introduction to Python 3biggest drawback: assignment autograding - if something fails, you do not know what fails, only that it fails (no info about test cases and results; negligible feedback from TAs)",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.622222222222

2502,Very straight forward course with easy to follow instructions. The autograder takes some getting used to. Make sure there are no additional lines at the end of your code and make sure everything is precisely copied for your output.,bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.714285714286
