2193,Good basic course. I may have missed it but there was no discussion of libraries or more importantly where to find them until week 3. I keep using 'import xyz' but not really knowing what it was doing. I finally found the library and documentation pages that were talked about in week 03. this seems a good place to actually LOOK at them but I think they should be mention with the first excersise in week 01... here we put in 'import xyz'. this has many many functions in it that allow us to shorten the work that we do. In week 03 we open the documentation file and a library file to see how to navigate those especially the documentation files ,bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.5151515151515151

The videos were a good addition. Coming from classical Unix NetBSD, I do not use integrated development environments a lot nor like them, per se , but I found Spyder a positive experience. Thanks esp. for that one! The grading of exercises was sometimes a bit picky, as it was not so clear what the grader was complaining about. More detailled feedback could help there.

I learned a lot, and feel confident to use python in future for more complicated scientific computing.cons The videos were too long, and I found I had all the info in the examples. I would have liked more guidance on how to build up simple structured programmes - the final assignment you have a giant programme already built, whereas you could have set some exercises for split this code into two subroutines that handle different jobs.The autograder was really frustrating sorry, I know it must be difficult to make something fair and automatic , but the great thing about a compiler or running a program is that you get to see the errors. The autograder just says 3 errors, and the problem turns out to be nothing to do with my program, which already produces the desired output.",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.5279503105590062

2325,"This course was pretty okay, I'd say. I did learn several new things and consider myself introduced to the world of python. Unfortunately, as a BRAND NEW programmer, it was, at times hard to keep up. There were a number of elements that weren't sufficiently explained during the lessons assignments presumably because we 'should' have a basic understanding of coding already...I guess? . If this is the case, some outside study background research may be necessary, at times. The instructor was actually relatively helpful, though the forum format makes for lag in help time, meaning you could be stuck on a problem or with a question for a while again...outside study research required . Overall, as I said, I learned things- yay! This course is for the very patient, however, and may likely by too simplistic for those with programming experience, too difficult for those who have never coded or maybe just right for some lucky few.",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.5319148936170213

2329,This was great. I had to do some more reading into the videos and spend more time trying to produce output in different formats to learn more. I liked the fact that I could read the comments before watching the video and that they were enough of a primer for the lecture. I wish there would have been a similar problem like the one for the database but one where we would need to write from scratch in order to get used to the different things introduced that week. This was great as it is one of the few that use Python 3 and as a beginner I wanted to learn the new first and then work out the differences later on.

I finally found the library and documentation pages that were talked about in week 03. this seems a good place to actually LOOK at them but I think they should be mention with the first excersise in week 01... here we put in 'import xyz'. this has many many functions in it that allow us to shorten the work that we do.

2484,"I know it is a lot asked, but would be great if the delivery was a bit more enthusiastic. Also a couple of suggestions to make the learning easier please do not use loud keyboard when making videos, and please be mindful that some people use single screen to view video and code on the side so if the details on video are very small it becomes quite hard to see what is being written.Thanks, Janis",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.6829268292682927

Bill, Thanks a lot for your hard effort ! Thanks also the participants who facilitated learning through discussion. ",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.6153846153846154
2494,"This course was pretty okay, I'd say. I did learn several new things and consider myself introduced to the world of python. Unfortunately, as a BRAND NEW programmer, it was, at times hard to keep up. There were a number of elements that weren't sufficiently explained during the lessons assignments presumably because we 'should' have a basic understanding of coding already...I guess? . If this is the case, some outside study background research may be necessary, at times. The instructor was actually relatively helpful, though the forum format makes for lag in help time, meaning you could be stuck on a problem or with a question for a while again...outside study research required . Overall, as I said, I learned things- yay! This course is for the very patient, however, and may likely by too simplistic for those with programming experience, too difficult for those who have never coded or maybe just right for some lucky few.",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.5319148936170213

2497,Fast and thorough.,bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.75
2498,This was great. I had to do some more reading into the videos and spend more time trying to produce output in different formats to learn more. I liked the fact that I could read the comments before watching the video and that they were enough of a primer for the lecture. I wish there would have been a similar problem like the one for the database but one where we would need to write from scratch in order to get used to the different things introduced that week. This was great as it is one of the few that use Python 3 and as a beginner I wanted to learn the new first and then work out the differences later on. Thumbs up Prof. Boyd and crew!!,bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.5407407407407407
