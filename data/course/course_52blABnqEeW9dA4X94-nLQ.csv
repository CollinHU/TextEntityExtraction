If you don't like to switch up and turn on a dime then this course is not for you. I had trouble aplenty and yet the point seemed to be stay flexible, be prepared to use obscure tools that are supposed to make the site work better but who knows exactly what is happening under the hood , expect change and adversity, become an expert at debugging that crappy code and refactoring everything at the drop of a hat. This is probably good approximation of real world experience where you would need to come in on a project and bail them out of angularjs damnation.

3616,There are steps that are missing at times which require you to scour for help. There are also quirks that aren't mentioned that other students have to point out. Unaddressed questions in the discussion board required escalation. Feels rushed and it's hard to learn for a beginner. Feels like you're just going through the motions and copy and pasting code.,52blABnqEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,0.5633802816901409
3617,I am a bit disappointed by this course. I was expecting a more fast paced course with more information regarding Angular. Unfortunately in the videos there is a lot of time spent on unnecessary details and reading out loud the source code. The exercises are quite basic and they did not pose real challenges - except for errors coming from mismatched packages or mistakes in configuration files. Also I think that the level of support provided by the mentors of this course is lacking. Mentors are quite absent and very late in providing any help in the forums so the students have to kind of counsel one another - that is sometimes good but a proper class also requires a good level of supervision.All in all I think this is an OK course that is mostly geared to the uninitiated. It needs some serious work to make it a great course.,52blABnqEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,0.525

Take it from someone who's first contact with Web Development was the first course in this Specialization HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript. My advice to students in a similar situation is to look for other sources of information as well and try to experiment with your code as the lessons go by so you can really grasp the meaning of the pieces of code you're writing.

4069,There are steps that are missing at times which require you to scour for help. There are also quirks that aren't mentioned that other students have to point out. Unaddressed questions in the discussion board required escalation. Feels rushed and it's hard to learn for a beginner. Feels like you're just going through the motions and copy and pasting code.,52blABnqEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,0.5633802816901409
4070,I am a bit disappointed by this course. I was expecting a more fast paced course with more information regarding Angular. Unfortunately in the videos there is a lot of time spent on unnecessary details and reading out loud the source code. The exercises are quite basic and they did not pose real challenges - except for errors coming from mismatched packages or mistakes in configuration files. Also I think that the level of support provided by the mentors of this course is lacking. Mentors are quite absent and very late in providing any help in the forums so the students have to kind of counsel one another - that is sometimes good but a proper class also requires a good level of supervision.All in all I think this is an OK course that is mostly geared to the uninitiated. It needs some serious work to make it a great course.,52blABnqEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,0.525
