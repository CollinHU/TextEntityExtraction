242,Very good. I enjoyed doing it and learned a lot. I would have liked that it had included r as one of the softwares. ,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.7037037037037037
243,easy to capture the concept,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,1.0
244,"Excellent introductory course on machine learning focusing on simple linear and multiple regression, lasso regression and k-means clustering. A background in Python programming is useful but not required as the instructors discuss the techniques with annotated code examples.",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.627906976744186

248,Very good course. I recommend to anyone who's interested in data analysis and machine learning.,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.8421052631578947
249,short vedios and good ma,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.8
250,"Not good at all.We see different processes without anyone making clear the reason why we should apply this processes ,under which conditions and what is the question that we have to answer when we apply these processes.The only good is that we get into some new terms and see new things.I could say that for me,it wouldn't make such a difference if it wasn't in this specialization.",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.5925925925925926
251,"It is very interesting, helpful, useful and wonderful course. Everybody who interesting in statistic must surely learn this course.",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.7391304347826086

253,Option of learning both SAS and Python is great!,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.8
254,Good introduction with python example for famous algorithm such as random forest and k-mean,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.9375
255,"Actually i want rate 0, as the instruction for the installation of new tools are quite vague and misleading",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.8
256,This level of detail was good for easier statistical concepts but there are much better courses on Coursera for Machine Learning,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.8095238095238095
257,It's not an intro class. But you can practice a lot if you know something. ,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.7368421052631579
258,"Disadvantages Lacks Rigour, Lacks Support from instructors , Expensive , Peer review this is somewhat bad as most barely give any comments, though towards the end, reviews tend to be pretty good . DISCLAIMER I am not statistically significant as i only receive 3 reviews per week. Advantages Quick to earn cert, prewritten code available for easy use. Assignments on your own data. This is probably useful for people wanting to learn techniques for data analysis, who need not go too deep into the technique. I would recommend this to people learning techniques for data analysis in various non-mathematical and non-statistical fields, though the content lacks rigour, and you need outside sources to help understand techniques. This course IS NOT WORTH PAYING USD79, there are definitely other courses much more worth the money. You can audit it for free, if you do not want a cert. ",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.536144578313253
259,More examples in coding and results are expected. So it is more convenient for students to compare different results and understand deeper,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.5652173913043478

261,Not impressed with the teaching style.Seems that lectures were being read and not taught.,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.6470588235294118
262,Not deep enough on diagnostic and interpretation,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,1.0
263,"It was okay for an introduction to the methods, but I would have liked to learn about them in more details, i.e. the course was too short.",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.6060606060606061
264,Excellent course,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,1.0
265,"I really liked this course. Concepts well explained. I was hoping for more practical exercises on different types of data sets along with how to improve model accuracy in various algorithm taught. concept such as pruning etc. were missing. But I am sure in future, we will have more on it. Thanks Professor.",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.6557377049180327
