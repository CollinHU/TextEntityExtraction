240,Very good. I enjoyed doing it and learned a lot. I would have liked that it had included r as one of the softwares. ,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.703703703704
241,easy to capture the concept,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,1.0
242,"Excellent introductory course on machine learning focusing on simple linear and multiple regression, lasso regression and k-means clustering. A background in Python programming is useful but not required as the instructors discuss the techniques with annotated code examples.",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.627906976744
243,Course could be better,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,1.0
244,"Excellent course, some basic tecniques of Machine Learning are implemented in Python and SAS.",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.6875
245,Great Class!,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.666666666667
246,Very good course. I recommend to anyone who's interested in data analysis and machine learning.,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.842105263158
247,short vedios and good ma,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.8
248,"Not good at all.We see different processes without anyone making clear the reason why we should apply this processes ,under which conditions and what is the question that we have to answer when we apply these processes.The only good is that we get into some new terms and see new things.I could say that for me,it wouldn't make such a difference if it wasn't in this specialization.",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.592592592593
249,"It is very interesting, helpful, useful and wonderful course. Everybody who interesting in statistic must surely learn this course.",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.739130434783

251,Option of learning both SAS and Python is great!,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.8
252,Good introduction with python example for famous algorithm such as random forest and k-mean,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.9375
253,"Actually i want rate 0, as the instruction for the installation of new tools are quite vague and misleading",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.8
254,This level of detail was good for easier statistical concepts but there are much better courses on Coursera for Machine Learning,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.809523809524
255,It's not an intro class. But you can practice a lot if you know something. ,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.736842105263
256,"Disadvantages : Lacks Rigour, Lacks Support from instructors , Expensive , Peer review ( this is somewhat bad as most barely give any comments, though towards the end, reviews tend to be pretty good). *** DISCLAIMER *** I am not statistically significant as i only receive 3 reviews per week. Advantages :Quick to earn cert, prewritten code available for easy use. Assignments on your own data. This is probably useful for people wanting to learn techniques for data analysis, who need not go too deep into the technique. I would recommend this to people learning techniques for data analysis in various non-mathematical and non-statistical fields, though the content lacks rigour, and you need outside sources to help understand techniques. This course IS NOT WORTH PAYING USD79, there are definitely other courses much more worth the money. You can audit it for free, if you do not want a cert. ",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.520467836257
257,More examples in coding and results are expected. So it is more convenient for students to compare different results and understand deeper,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.565217391304
258,I would like to have an opportunity to contact my reviews.,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.75
259,Not impressed with the teaching style.Seems that lectures were being read and not taught.,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.647058823529
260,Not deep enough on diagnostic and interpretation,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,1.0
261,"It was okay for an introduction to the methods, but I would have liked to learn about them in more details, i.e. the course was too short.",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.606060606061
262,Excellent course,senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,1.0
263,"I really liked this course. Concepts well explained. I was hoping for more practical exercises on different types of data sets along with how to improve model accuracy in various algorithm taught. concept such as pruning etc. were missing. But I am sure in future, we will have more on it. Thanks Professor.",senhGTbqEeWw6g4yTrGrVQ,0.655737704918
