4586,"I think this course was way too ambitious. It's neat to imagine learning all of this stuff in four weeks, but one should be realistic. Sure, we had lectures explaining things, but in the end we mostly had to copy-and-paste code and confirm that it worked. There should have been many, many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understanding.Perhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate. To really understand and absorb this stuff, I'll need to spend a lot of time with the additional resources. The lectures and scaffolded exercises certainly exposed us to a lot, but it would be hard to say I really learned very much.",ycQnChn3EeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.5185185185185185

Peer grading is just dumb and clearly doesn't work, since I have yet to get a single assignment back .

4708,"I would like to express my gratitude to prof. Muppala for this incredible course.There are indeed many great resources for learning any of the technologies and tools used in this course and specialization. But what is unique about this specialization, is that it gives us not only solid foundations needed to use these tools, but, just as importantly, a clear context as to where a certain tool or its segment is used. Sure enough, having in mind the broader context, it is much easier to understand all of the segments individually.I would also like to thank Kre??imir and all the other mentors that helped make this course a pleasant experience.I can't wait for the next course on Angular JS to start!",ycQnChn3EeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.5035460992907801

The assignments at the end of the week are challenging in that they usually ask you to learn something from a 3rd part website or take what you know and combine it in ways he hasn't shown you.

4888,"Fairly disappointing compared to the first week of this course. The balance of instruction to exercise was very low. I also resent being sent to raw Bootstrap documentation; if I could have read that, I likely wouldn't be taking the course. It makes it frustrating to jump into the exercises when the course had 5-7 minutes of lectures, 15 minutes on the exercise and then an assignment on something new.Update I'm also impressed by Mr. Muppala taking feedback like a boss and blaming students for low reviews.",ycQnChn3EeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.5145631067961165

A lot of very useful stuff was covered, but I feel like it went too fast.But I think it could be better connected together in terms of broad principles, rather than just going through tons of particular examples. I still don't feel like I have a mental framework for how to lay out a web page, other than the basics of the 12-column grid system. It all seemed very ad hoc.It's by no means a bad course, and I still gave it four stars since the material is very useful, but I definitely think it could be improved upon.Also, the ratio of homework lectures is way too low. I definitely think the course should put more emphasis on actually creating websites oneself.

5169,"Although the course structure and information is great, the course exercise and grading organization has a lot of space for improvement. Current structure doesn't make it possible for the learner to determine the speed. All the parts are equally important. You have to carefully go through hours of instructions. Each week and the assignment builds on what you have done before, but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations. This causes a lot of confusion.Peer evaluation rules are not shown before you submit your work. After submitting my work, I discovered that there are requirements that were not in the assignment.",ycQnChn3EeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.5409836065573771

Sure, we had lectures explaining things, but in the end we mostly had to copy-and-paste code and confirm that it worked. There should have been many, many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understanding.Perhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate. To really understand and absorb this stuff, I'll need to spend a lot of time with the additional resources.

A lot of very useful stuff was covered, but I feel like it went too fast.But I think it could be better connected together in terms of broad principles, rather than just going through tons of particular examples. I still don't feel like I have a mental framework for how to lay out a web page, other than the basics of the 12-column grid system. It all seemed very ad hoc.It's by no means a bad course, and I still gave it four stars since the material is very useful, but I definitely think it could be improved upon.Also, the ratio of homework lectures is way too low. I definitely think the course should put more emphasis on actually creating websites oneself.

5627,"Although the course structure and information is great, the course exercise and grading organization has a lot of space for improvement. Current structure doesn't make it possible for the learner to determine the speed. All the parts are equally important. You have to carefully go through hours of instructions. Each week and the assignment builds on what you have done before, but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations. This causes a lot of confusion.Peer evaluation rules are not shown before you submit your work. After submitting my work, I discovered that there are requirements that were not in the assignment.",ycQnChn3EeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.5409836065573771
