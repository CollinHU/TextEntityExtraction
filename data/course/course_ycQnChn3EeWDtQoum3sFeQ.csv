Sure, we had lectures explaining things, but in the end we mostly had to copy-and-paste code and confirm that it worked. There should have been many, many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understanding.Perhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate. To really understand and absorb this stuff, I'll need to spend a lot of time with the additional resources.

I've turned in around 10 assignments and have yet to get a grade on anything. The course content is poorly organized and executed. Peer grading is just dumb (and clearly doesn't work, since I have yet to get a single assignment back). When you turn in assignment files, they cannot be opened (and we found out from an apparent student how to get past the technical issues).

The assignments at the end of the week are challenging in that they usually ask you to learn something from a 3rd part website or take what you know and combine it in ways he hasn't shown you. While that might be difficult for some I find it refreshing.

4857,"Fairly disappointing compared to the first week of this course. The balance of instruction to exercise was very low. I also resent being sent to raw Bootstrap documentation; if I could have read that, I likely wouldn't be taking the course. It makes it frustrating to jump into the exercises when the course had 5-7 minutes of lectures, 15 minutes on the exercise and then an assignment on something new.Update: I'm also impressed by Mr. Muppala taking feedback like a boss and blaming students for low reviews.",ycQnChn3EeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.509615384615

A lot of very useful stuff was covered, but I feel like it went too fast.But I think it could be better connected together in terms of broad principles, rather than just going through tons of particular examples. I still don't feel like I have a mental framework for how to lay out a web page, other than the basics of the 12-column grid system. It all seemed very ad hoc.It's by no means a bad course, and I still gave it four stars since the material is very useful, but I definitely think it could be improved upon.Also, the ratio of homework/lectures is way too low. I definitely think the course should put more emphasis on actually creating websites oneself.

Each week and the assignment builds on what you have done before, but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations. This causes a lot of confusion.Peer evaluation rules are not shown before you submit your work.

5319,"I think this course was way too ambitious. It's neat to imagine learning all of this stuff in four weeks, but one should be realistic. Sure, we had lectures explaining things, but in the end we mostly had to copy-and-paste code and confirm that it worked. There should have been many, many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understanding.Perhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate. To really understand and absorb this stuff, I'll need to spend a lot of time with the additional resources. The lectures and scaffolded exercises certainly exposed us to a lot, but it would be hard to say I really learned very much.",ycQnChn3EeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.518518518519

The instructor is very knowledgeable and explains things thoroughly (he's also very funny!).

5516,"This course was pretty cool. A lot of very useful stuff was covered, but I feel like it went too fast.But I think it could be better connected together in terms of broad principles, rather than just going through tons of particular examples. I still don't feel like I have a mental framework for how to lay out a web page, other than the basics of the 12-column grid system. It all seemed very ad hoc.It's by no means a bad course, and I still gave it four stars since the material is very useful, but I definitely think it could be improved upon.Also, the ratio of homework/lectures is way too low. I definitely think the course should put more emphasis on actually creating websites oneself.
