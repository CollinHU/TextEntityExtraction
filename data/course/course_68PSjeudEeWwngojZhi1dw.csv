6019,very good for learners,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.75
6020,I found that there were a lot of mathematical function in this course. I need to see the examples of how are those functions applied in the real programming which support the business.,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.714285714286
6021,"Very well mounted course.For the majority of the topics explained, focused on techniques, not jut on theory.Good suplemental lectures listed.",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.518518518519
6022,More programming assignments would have helped understanding the topics covered in the course better.,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.6

6025,It's worth to learn!,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.714285714286
6026,"Interessant, but it wasn't organized too well. Some questions referred to topics which came in the next lesson",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.636363636364
6027," Too much theories ,I hope the professor add more programming assignment.",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.692307692308
6028,"Very good course, but could have something practical.",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.8
6029,great introductory course for IR ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.8
6030,"The course was great. What I had a real problem with was the lack of response for problems with the Honors programming assignments. I never received any feedback from the TA's and when I submitted to MeTa support, they said the school design the programs so they can't help. I got a Segmentation Fault on Assignment one which I never did get resolved. Because of this, I was unable to get the Honors status. ",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.576470588235
6031, Great!,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.5
6032,excellent material and great explanations! The main problem here is that quizzes will sometimes cover subjects not introduced until the following week. ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.708333333333
6033,This course is really great but the programming assignments need to be updated. ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.714285714286
6034,thanks,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,1.0
6035,Great course for those trying to understand how ro analyse and process text data. It has the right amount of tools to help you understand the basics of information retrieval and search engines.,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.657142857143
6036,Ok. It was a rerun and there wasn't much help in the Forum and there were too few exercises. But it was really interesting.,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.620689655172
6037,The explanation is detailed and clear. But the missing star is because I hoped the course would have programming assignments using popular language as python.,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.703703703704
6038,Good survey of techniques,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.75
6039,A great overview of text retrieval methods. Good coverage of search engines. A longer course will cover search engine better (remember this is a 6 weeker),68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.6
6040,"The videos could not be too longer than they actually are. If this change, could be done, the student or user could have more time to dig into the assignments problems and even read more textbooks related to the main topic.",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.644444444444
6041,"Excellent ! Well organized, presented with aptitude to detail. Definitely will recommend and take further units in this specialization. Thanks Prof",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.75
6042,Excellent Introduction to Text Retrieval and Search Engines technologies.,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.7
6043,much help for deep understanding of TR,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.857142857143
6044,G,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,1.0
6045,like it.,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.666666666667
6046,The course is interesting and you can learn a lot. The professor is very knowledgeable in the area of search engines. However the course goes very early into mathematical details without too much context. The programming assignments are great and I would focus more on them as they really show you how the engine works. ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.694915254237

6048,"This is not a class I would normally pursue. I took it as part of the Data Mining certification. That being said, this class was wonderful. I learned the basics of text retrieval and search engines. I went from knowing nothing, to having a working sense of how search engine algorithms work. It was a challenging course for me, but very much worth the time and effort I put into it. It was like pulling back the curtain on the code behind Google, Netflix, and Amazon searches, and that has made me think of the world in a different way. I am now a human happily collaborating with machine learning systems. Thank you!!",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.546875
6049,Very good course for someone who wants to understand how text retrieval works. ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.857142857143
6050,This course is complemented with a software and text (not mandatory) and good explanation with diagrams... ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.578947368421
6051,"Very theoretical and somewhat dry. If you are interested in applied machine learning techniques (for text retrieval and analysis) this is not really the course to take. Gives a solid background though which, in my opinion, every aspiring data analyst needs.",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.770833333333
6052,Great insights in this course... I learned so much!!,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.727272727273
6053,"The material is compelling and the lecturer is engaging, but the course is not well prepared. The assessments are not relevant to the material covered and there are no collateral materials (e.g., downloadable slides/handouts) available to assist in learning.",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.510204081633
