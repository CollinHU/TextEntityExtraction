6058,very good for learners,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.75
6059,I found that there were a lot of mathematical function in this course. I need to see the examples of how are those functions applied in the real programming which support the business.,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.7142857142857143
6060,"Very well mounted course.For the majority of the topics explained, focused on techniques, not jut on theory.Good suplemental lectures listed.",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.5185185185185185

6068,great introductory course for IR ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.8
6069,"The course was great. What I had a real problem with was the lack of response for problems with the Honors programming assignments. I never received any feedback from the TA's and when I submitted to MeTa support, they said the school design the programs so they can't help. I got a Segmentation Fault on Assignment one which I never did get resolved. Because of this, I was unable to get the Honors status. ",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.5764705882352941
6070, Great!,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.5
6071,excellent material and great explanations! The main problem here is that quizzes will sometimes cover subjects not introduced until the following week. ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.7083333333333334
6072,This course is really great but the programming assignments need to be updated. ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.7142857142857143

6074,Great course for those trying to understand how ro analyse and process text data. It has the right amount of tools to help you understand the basics of information retrieval and search engines.,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.6571428571428571
6075,Ok. It was a rerun and there wasn't much help in the Forum and there were too few exercises. But it was really interesting.,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.6206896551724138
6076,The explanation is detailed and clear. But the missing star is because I hoped the course would have programming assignments using popular language as python.,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.7037037037037037
6077,Good survey of techniques,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.75
6078,A great overview of text retrieval methods. Good coverage of search engines. A longer course will cover search engine better remember this is a 6 weeker ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.6428571428571429
6079,"The videos could not be too longer than they actually are. If this change, could be done, the student or user could have more time to dig into the assignments problems and even read more textbooks related to the main topic.",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.6444444444444445

6085,The course is interesting and you can learn a lot. The professor is very knowledgeable in the area of search engines. However the course goes very early into mathematical details without too much context. The programming assignments are great and I would focus more on them as they really show you how the engine works. ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.6949152542372882

6087,"This is not a class I would normally pursue. I took it as part of the Data Mining certification. That being said, this class was wonderful. I learned the basics of text retrieval and search engines. I went from knowing nothing, to having a working sense of how search engine algorithms work. It was a challenging course for me, but very much worth the time and effort I put into it. It was like pulling back the curtain on the code behind Google, Netflix, and Amazon searches, and that has made me think of the world in a different way. I am now a human happily collaborating with machine learning systems. Thank you!!",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.546875
6088,Very good course for someone who wants to understand how text retrieval works. ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.8571428571428571
6089,This course is complemented with a software and text not mandatory and good explanation with diagrams... ,68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.6470588235294118
6090,"Very theoretical and somewhat dry. If you are interested in applied machine learning techniques for text retrieval and analysis this is not really the course to take. Gives a solid background though which, in my opinion, every aspiring data analyst needs.",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.8043478260869565

6092,"The material is compelling and the lecturer is engaging, but the course is not well prepared. The assessments are not relevant to the material covered and there are no collateral materials e.g., downloadable slides handouts available to assist in learning.",68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,0.5434782608695652
