5756,"It's a good introduction to mobile app development; however, the class is unmaintained. Since 2014 when the videos and lectures were written, the frameworks have advanced and become incompatible with the lessons. Links in the lessons to documentation do not give useful information because they're for the wrong version of the framework. Still worth taking, but as a paid class I have higher expectations.

5948,A massive thanks to Prof. Muppala - this course provides a very gentle and easy to access entry into the world of app development. I tried to get into Android Studio and Xcode before and was overwhelmed by both - taking this approach made it a lot easier for me to get started and the course layout (especially in conjunction with the previous course about AngularJS) provided me with just the right tools and concepts at the right time and pace!,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.558139534884
5949,Excellent course. This was a great intro to hybrid app development. The specialization has been building gradually to this point and everything learned so far has been helpful in grasping the concepts for this course. ,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.631578947368

5957,"The lectures and assignments dealing with Ionic were useful and informative, but that's only the first half of the course. The Android/iOS portion felt extremely rushed.

5966,I got the feeling that we ran through the material and did not spend ample time setting up the testing and understanding the environment. Maybe the course need to be two weeks to cover this properly. ,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.763157894737

5970,I took the initial offering of this courser. It is an excellent class that I am sure will only improve over time. Prof. Muppala is a wonderful instructor and I learned so much in this course. My only suggestion would be to clarify some of the grading details as there were some questions on certain items in the last assignment. I would definitely recommend this series of courses and I am looking forward to taking the final course in this Full Stack Web Development series.,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.626373626374

5972,A well explained with good support course! I recommend this to everyone interested in the field. Note: I would want to know how to move further with the app and introduce it inside app store and google play store. This is omitted in the course. I am looking forward for this course updates if there will be any - and I think it will be improved!,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.541666666667
