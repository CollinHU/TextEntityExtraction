5794,"It's a good introduction to mobile app development; however, the class is unmaintained. Since 2014 when the videos and lectures were written, the frameworks have advanced and become incompatible with the lessons. Links in the lessons to documentation do not give useful information because they're for the wrong version of the framework. Still worth taking, but as a paid class I have higher expectations.

5866,A massive thanks to Prof. Muppala - this course provides a very gentle and easy to access entry into the world of app development. I tried to get into Android Studio and Xcode before and was overwhelmed by both - taking this approach made it a lot easier for me to get started and the course layout especially in conjunction with the previous course about AngularJS provided me with just the right tools and concepts at the right time and pace!,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.5714285714285714

5882,"The lectures and assignments dealing with Ionic were useful and informative, but that's only the first half of the course. The Android iOS portion felt extremely rushed.

5892,"I can't just rating and didn't write a preview. Because this course is so useful and have a great lecturer. What I like most is, the exercise, the assignment is so really EXCITING and make me want to learn more about whole MEAN stack. Biggest thank's for the Lecturer. Really recommended for you who still reading and don't want to purchase this course. Because this is really WORTH it! Thank you. God Bless you!",-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.5434782608695652

5894,Awesome!,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.5
5895,The material is not mature yet. Some things were not tested by the teacher before being part of the course and do not actually work. Questions asked on the forums about it got no answers before the end of the course.,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.5909090909090909
5896, Excellent introduction! ,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.6666666666666666
5897,"This course serves as a great introduction to mobile web development. Notice that multiplatform in this case means iOS and Android no Windows Phone and you do get a bit of hands on work on Android SDK and XCode, although mostly for setting up both environments. Professor Muppala is again outstanding in the class, covering a wide range of topics combined with multiple exercises which in my case really furthered my understanding. One thing I believe could improve would be having either at least one assignment forcing you to deploy to Android and another one to iOS. In my case, it was just too comfortable to simply deploy to an iOS device and barely look at Android. Also, the vibration function should not be part of an assignment, as not everyone will have a device to test it and neither of the emulators really use it. One final recommendation for those pressed with time I was able to follow Professor Muppala quite easily while playing the lectures at 1.75x it's funny how slow he seems to speak when I set in back to 1x - .",-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.5074626865671642
5898,Good,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,1.0
5899,I got the feeling that we ran through the material and did not spend ample time setting up the testing and understanding the environment. Maybe the course need to be two weeks to cover this properly. ,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.7631578947368421

5906,I took the initial offering of this courser. It is an excellent class that I am sure will only improve over time. Prof. Muppala is a wonderful instructor and I learned so much in this course. My only suggestion would be to clarify some of the grading details as there were some questions on certain items in the last assignment. I would definitely recommend this series of courses and I am looking forward to taking the final course in this Full Stack Web Development series.,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.6263736263736264

6009,I took the initial offering of this courser. It is an excellent class that I am sure will only improve over time. Prof. Muppala is a wonderful instructor and I learned so much in this course. My only suggestion would be to clarify some of the grading details as there were some questions on certain items in the last assignment.

6011,A well explained with good support course! I recommend this to everyone interested in the field. Note I would want to know how to move further with the app and introduce it inside app store and google play store. This is omitted in the course. I am looking forward for this course updates if there will be any - and I think it will be improved!,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.5492957746478874
