2869,"Breadth depth of content is great. Biggest issue is lectures &amp; slides to not always tell you everything you need to know to take the tests &amp; assignments - best to take Andrew Ng's course first and be ready to search on Google to find things you don't understand.

I would suggest adding either more materials or recommended links for those willing to dig further into the mathematics details of some topics RBMs for instance , as the material shown in the slides is way too sparse sometimes. The practical assignments were well planned and extremely useful and helpful to master some of the concepts, thanks for that.

2906,"This is a very interesting course that blends theory, intuition and practice but it is also demanding, also in time. It covers a lot of different topics, and is a fantastic overview of neural networks - perhaps with a slight bias to the work interests of Professor Hinton, which is fully okay - but probably too difficult as a first course - I would recommend taking a basic neural network course prior to taking this course.

2917,"This course is a mess. Do not even dare to take it without first doing Machine Learning by Andrew Ng excellent starter and before reading Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville. The presentations are awfully boring, there is little interaction of the material unlike Ng who is deriving the math on screen . Hinton is basically just reading off the crowded slides. Very poor didactic style. I would even go so far as to say that the approach is unscientific no definitions, derivations, examples. Terms just pop out of the blue.If you already know the topic well, you might gain additional insight from a pundit. Quizes are nice puzzles that need some thinking and math knowledge. Programming tasks are not even in the same ballpark as Ng's. Overall very bad use of the medium available.Invest your time in reading Deep Learning, its challenging but at least its got a very logical structure and style. Also consider Hugo Larochelle's videos.",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5271739130434783

Recommended!",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5657894736842105
2920,Excellent course! Hinton is a superstar in the field who has made many discoveries in neural networks. He does an excellent job of explaining a number of key techniques. One of the best features was his commentary on the intuition behind why these methods work. Since he came up with a number of these ideas himself or was part of the team that did he has a unique insight into how you can think about a problem to motivate a possibly fruitful approach. The other aspect of the course that I liked best was Hinton's copious use of real-world examples and feedback about which methods worked well on certain problems and why. The course is fairly challenging but well worth the effort. Thank you for sharing your insights Professor Hinton!,meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5352112676056338

Some of the explanations were a little mysterious to this student e.g. how can you discuss sampling of restricted Boltzmann machines, which are essentially bipartite Ising models, without mentioning conditional probability? . However, Professor Hinton motivated everything so well that I always wanted to understand what was going on, and so frequently would pause the videos while I consulted other online resources to find out more about the topic at hand. The programming assignments were also well-designed, so that I found myself forced to confront various aspects of the models and algorithms that I'd thought I'd understood the first time round but in fact had not.

Mentors were unhelpful and generally unresponsive during the course, course content was broken and or missing, and the level of background in both calculus probability needed to truly understand the material in this course was not obvious at all from the beginning.

2992,"Excellent lectures; Hinton conveys depth and theoretical clarity along with practical, down to earth advice on how to get useful things done without wasting time. Unfortunately the staff did a rather spotty job of updatating and maintaining the problem sets and I had to repeatedly find corrections from other students on the forums since apparently no one was fixing the problem sets in response to the forum discussions.

2995,"Overall, a good and challenging course that covered a range of material from perceptrons to feed forward nets and Deep Belief Networks. However, I felt that some of the material is a little dated - convolutional neural networks did not get the coverage warranted by their recent successes. Some of the quiz items were off-syllabus too, although this encouraged further reading. I enjoyed the programming exercises, particularly on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and would have liked more of them. For beginners I would recommend they take Andrew Ng's course first.",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5339805825242718

There were a few quiz problems I spent a while on, only to check the discussion section and realize that the information image provided was inaccurate. The coding assignments could be slightly more frequent. Overall, this was a good course. It seems like it would be difficult to give a thorough treatment of this topic by simply watching these lectures and taking the quizzes programming assignments. I think this course is best used for introductions to various topics authors, which can then be used as a stepping stone for more intricate, individual study on those topics.",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5496183206106869

3018,"Very good and interesting introduction to neural networks. I particularly appreciated the history behind the different types of neural networks so that one understands where the basic ideas come from.

3020,"This is a great mathematical course to understand what's going on, but the assignments and quizzes are just repetitive and basically run these commands. Professor Hinton definitely knows his stuff, and just sitting through his lectures was worth the time. That being said, Week 13 is busted as of 2017-1-22, Question 6 and 7 use variables values that are never mentioned.

3029,Prof Hinton shares all his knowledge in designing an award-winning neural network. This is less a hands-on course but is more a very profound teaching of deep learning theory. If you can understand everything that is taught in this course then you will be the next genius that comes up with the next bleeding edge neural nets. That's not for me though as I struggled from week to week till the end but I learned a lot.

3030,"Overall I really loved this course, and taking it from such an important name in the field was cool. There were a number of technical glitches on the quizzes, unfortunately, and often the wording on quizzes was unnecessarily confusing but still manageable so I dock it a single star. Also the visual organization of the lecture slides is a little shoddy compared to many other versions of nearly identical slides from Hinton's courses found online elsewhere. On the mobile app, many of the quiz questions were impossible to complete because graphics could not load. Not sure if it's a problem with the course materials or with the app or with my device, so that has not affected my rating. For anyone considering this course, be advised that ability in calculus and statistics are required for mastery of this material.",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5225806451612903

3038,"The course gives I think a good overview over the concepts of neural networks and the teaching material is good. However generally the course is more advanced than I suspected, so it took me much more time then what is given for the lectures quizzes to complete it. If you are not already familiar with the concepts and or have a strong mathematical background it can be sometimes frustrating - One thing that definitively needs improvement is that 2 times the questions of the quizzes were corrupted parts were missing . Not sure if this was due to the material itself or a bug in the Cousera platform.

He motivates the theory behind each approach he advances very well. Unfortunately, the practical side of the pedagogy of this course is not as strong. It is understandable to not turn this into a programming class. However, there is too much of a gap between even a clear explanation of theory and actual practice.

Starting around weeks 11-12 the lectures become a bit vague, and I had quite some difficulty understanding them. It seemed to me that these lectures were hastily created even though I can only imagine how much work creating this course must have been . Furthermore, the lab sessions are rather easy and the provided code is annoying to work with systematically since they output results as printed text instead of something re-usable. This makes experimentation like grid searches a bit tedious. Besides these minor things, the course is quite good.Note that deep learning topics are only briefly touched, but you won't obtain the skills for training and designing them yourself without further exploration of the topics.Finally, many thanks to the teachers!",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5625

One of the best features was his commentary on the intuition behind why these methods work. Since he came up with a number of these ideas himself or was part of the team that did he has a unique insight into how you can think about a problem to motivate a possibly fruitful approach.

3190,"This is a great course. Unlike Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, this course does not shy away from using real mathematics to explain the models being studied, and is all the better for it. Some of the explanations were a little mysterious to this student e.g. how can you discuss sampling of restricted Boltzmann machines, which are essentially bipartite Ising models, without mentioning conditional probability? . However, Professor Hinton motivated everything so well that I always wanted to understand what was going on, and so frequently would pause the videos while I consulted other online resources to find out more about the topic at hand. The programming assignments were also well-designed, so that I found myself forced to confront various aspects of the models and algorithms that I'd thought I'd understood the first time round but in fact had not.

Can be a struggle if you come in with no context.I'd never heard of Hopfield Nets or Boltzmann Machines and I found it difficult to understand what was going on in the last few weeks. I think I was missing intuition and having many more concrete examples might have helped. On the other hand, for example, I already knew a few ideas behind convolution neural networks and the lectures cleared a lot up.

There were a number of technical glitches on the quizzes, unfortunately, and often the wording on quizzes was unnecessarily confusing but still manageable so I dock it a single star. Also the visual organization of the lecture slides is a little shoddy compared to many other versions of nearly identical slides from Hinton's courses found online elsewhere. On the mobile app, many of the quiz questions were impossible to complete because graphics could not load.

He motivates the theory behind each approach he advances very well. Unfortunately, the practical side of the pedagogy of this course is not as strong. It is understandable to not turn this into a programming class. However, there is too much of a gap between even a clear explanation of theory and actual practice.

3295,"The course was ported to the new Coursera platform in a amateurish way without any testing. Learners have been complaining on the forums for months about bugs and missing information in the assessments, and they are still not fixed. The content is generally interesting, but not presented in a cohesive way. Many concepts are juggled with without giving clear, mathematical definitions.",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5588235294117647

3298,"Informative. I spent way more time on the programming assignments than the posted estimate. There was an error in the text for Programming Assignment 4 that was really frustrating; but luckily, someone had found the correct way to do it and had posted it on the forum. The intuition explanations during the lectures were great. All-around great course.",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.582089552238806

3302,"It is a great privilege to learn neural networks by Prof. Hinton, a giant in the field of neural networks, and I am grateful for that. This course is excellent as a broad introduction to neural networks. Prof. Hinton conveys a lot of intuition and technical details, and for people like me, who has no experience in neural networks sometimes it is difficult to see the forest for the trees. ",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5063291139240507
3303,"This course is good, unique and relevant for machine learning today. Some things can be improved though. Starting around weeks 11-12 the lectures become a bit vague, and I had quite some difficulty understanding them. It seemed to me that these lectures were hastily created even though I can only imagine how much work creating this course must have been . Furthermore, the lab sessions are rather easy and the provided code is annoying to work with systematically since they output results as printed text instead of something re-usable. This makes experimentation like grid searches a bit tedious. Besides these minor things, the course is quite good.Note that deep learning topics are only briefly touched, but you won't obtain the skills for training and designing them yourself without further exploration of the topics.Finally, many thanks to the teachers!",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5625
3304,Great course with awesome theory. The quizzes are great and help to re-inforce the conceptsImprovement area is availabililty of exercises in R &amp; Python and more programming assignments. Only 2 programming assignments are a shame,meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5121951219512195
3305,"Really liked the course. The concepts were explained thoroughly, and I think I can apply some of the things I learned directly. Only downside was, that it is using Octave ",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.6176470588235294

3311,"I really like this course. Geoffrey Hinton is one of the very best researchers in Neural Networks in the world. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for substandard implementation of its tests misaligned questions and missing question content and programming exercises missing supporting documentation and code . I was able to get through this problems by googling it, but this was frustrating. Once this problems are sorted out, this course will be really enjoyable. ",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5121951219512195
