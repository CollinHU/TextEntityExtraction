2859,"There is a lot of material to cover however, I think the professor and his crew do a good job on touching the most important points. The discussion group is also extremely helpful. I would suggest adding either more materials or recommended links for those willing to dig further into the mathematics details of some topics (RBMs for instance), as the material shown in the slides is way too sparse sometimes. The practical assignments were well planned and extremely useful and helpful to master some of the concepts, thanks for that. I am in the process of cleaning up the code in a way that I believe would be easier for students to understand them. I will contribute them back to the course in case there is any interest.

2881,"This is a very interesting course that blends theory, intuition and practice but it is also demanding, also in time. It covers a lot of different topics, and is a fantastic overview of neural networks - perhaps with a slight bias to the work/interests of Professor Hinton, which is fully okay :) - but probably too difficult as a first course - I would recommend taking a basic neural network course prior to taking this course.

2890,"For those who want more than just a hands on intro to neural networks this is the course for you. I've been through many resources that treat Neural Nets as a black box which, while being a fine intro, fails to give me the understanding required to do anything other than follow a tutorial.

2892,"This course is a mess. Do not even dare to take it without first doing Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (excellent starter) and before reading Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville. The presentations are awfully boring, there is little interaction of the material (unlike Ng who is deriving the math on screen). Hinton is basically just reading off the crowded slides. Very poor didactic style. I would even go so far as to say that the approach is unscientific: no definitions, derivations, examples. Terms just pop out of the blue.If you already know the topic well, you might gain additional insight from a pundit. Quizes are nice puzzles that need some thinking and math knowledge. Programming tasks are not even in the same ballpark as Ng's. Overall very bad use of the medium available.Invest your time in reading Deep Learning, its challenging but at least its got a very logical structure and style. Also consider Hugo Larochelle's videos.",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.515957446809

2894,"This is a very thorough introductory course to the field of Machine Learning. I would have given it 5 stars, but towards the end, I felt the lessons got a bit sloppier. New concepts not thoroughly explained, sloppier slides, and even a lecture video missing at one point (had to find a link to it on youtube)! Still a very solid, instructive course, though. Recommended!",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.558441558442
2895,Excellent course! Hinton is a superstar in the field who has made many discoveries in neural networks. He does an excellent job of explaining a number of key techniques. One of the best features was his commentary on the intuition behind why these methods work. Since he came up with a number of these ideas himself (or was part of the team that did) he has a unique insight into how you can think about a problem to motivate a possibly fruitful approach. The other aspect of the course that I liked best was Hinton's copious use of real-world examples and feedback about which methods worked well on certain problems and why. The course is fairly challenging but well worth the effort. Thank you for sharing your insights Professor Hinton!,meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.527777777778

2915,Course presents an amazing set of topics form experience which spans over several decades. Professor is leading name in the field.

2916,"The lectures have basically no training or necessary teachings for the math needed for the quizzes. You spend way more time looking for resources about how to answer the quiz questions than the lectures will take to review.

2926,"This is a great course. Unlike Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, this course does not shy away from using real mathematics to explain the models being studied, and is all the better for it. Some of the explanations were a little mysterious to this student (e.g. how can you discuss sampling of restricted Boltzmann machines, which are essentially bipartite Ising models, without mentioning conditional probability?). However, Professor Hinton motivated everything so well that I always *wanted* to understand what was going on, and so frequently would pause the videos while I consulted other online resources to find out more about the topic at hand. The programming assignments were also well-designed, so that I found myself forced to confront various aspects of the models and algorithms that I'd thought I'd understood the first time round but in fact had not.

Can be a struggle if you come in with no context.I'd never heard of Hopfield Nets or Boltzmann Machines and I found it difficult to understand what was going on in the last few weeks. I think I was missing intuition and having many more concrete examples might have helped. On the other hand, for example, I already knew a few ideas behind convolution neural networks and the lectures cleared a lot up.

There were a number of technical glitches on the quizzes, unfortunately, and often the wording on quizzes was unnecessarily confusing (but still manageable) so I dock it a single star. Also the visual organization of the lecture slides is a little shoddy compared to many other versions of nearly identical slides from Hinton's courses found online elsewhere. On the mobile app, many of the quiz questions were impossible to complete because graphics could not load.

Starting around weeks 11-12 the lectures become a bit vague, and I had quite some difficulty understanding them. It seemed to me that these lectures were hastily created (even though I can only imagine how much work creating this course must have been). Furthermore, the lab sessions are rather easy and the provided code is annoying to work with systematically since they output results as printed text instead of something re-usable. This makes experimentation (like grid searches) a bit tedious. Besides these minor things, the course is quite good.Note that deep learning topics are only briefly touched, but you won't obtain the skills for training and designing them yourself without further exploration of the topics.Finally, many thanks to the teachers!",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.552147239264

One of the best features was his commentary on the intuition behind why these methods work. Since he came up with a number of these ideas himself (or was part of the team that did) he has a unique insight into how you can think about a problem to motivate a possibly fruitful approach.

However, Professor Hinton motivated everything so well that I always *wanted* to understand what was going on, and so frequently would pause the videos while I consulted other online resources to find out more about the topic at hand.

There were a number of technical glitches on the quizzes, unfortunately, and often the wording on quizzes was unnecessarily confusing (but still manageable) so I dock it a single star. Also the visual organization of the lecture slides is a little shoddy compared to many other versions of nearly identical slides from Hinton's courses found online elsewhere. On the mobile app, many of the quiz questions were impossible to complete because graphics could not load.

3275,"It is a great privilege to learn neural networks by Prof. Hinton, a giant in the field of neural networks, and I am grateful for that. This course is excellent as a broad introduction to neural networks. Prof. Hinton conveys a lot of intuition and technical details, and for people like me, who has no experience in neural networks sometimes it is difficult to see the forest for the trees.

3276,"This course is good, unique and relevant for machine learning today. Some things can be improved though. Starting around weeks 11-12 the lectures become a bit vague, and I had quite some difficulty understanding them. It seemed to me that these lectures were hastily created (even though I can only imagine how much work creating this course must have been). Furthermore, the lab sessions are rather easy and the provided code is annoying to work with systematically since they output results as printed text instead of something re-usable. This makes experimentation (like grid searches) a bit tedious. Besides these minor things, the course is quite good.Note that deep learning topics are only briefly touched, but you won't obtain the skills for training and designing them yourself without further exploration of the topics.Finally, many thanks to the teachers!",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.552147239264
3277,Great course with awesome theory. The quizzes are great and help to re-inforce the conceptsImprovement area is availabililty of exercises in R &amp; Python and more programming assignments. Only 2 programming assignments are a shame,meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.512195121951
