371,"I really like the way that the professors explain everything.

384,Very useful ,NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,1.0
385,Course was well paced. Assignments were relevant. Only shortcoming I believe was that the last two weeks of the course did not require any submission of a coding assignment. Only required a quiz. I feel that the course would benefit from a requirement to submit some code each week.,NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.6296296296296297

392,"I'm graduated in System Analysis, not Computer Sciences, and learned to program only by experience. After 20 years it's a good deal but still I missed the theoretical background and this always annoyed me. I knew and used to make good use of all the structures presented in this course but never could quite explain how or why, or talk in asymptotic notations. Now I can. I didn't stop here, I do take some topics to deep dive during the lectures. It's being a great experience and I only wish I could have more time to keep myself always enrolled in some course.",NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.5371900826446281
393,"As 2 previous courses of this specialization - the authors did a great job! I really enjoy it and learn a lot of things.

405,"This course was very well put together. The videos were clear and well organized. They typically contained a powerpoint presentation and little box with the presenter's head. The assignments built off of each other by reusing code from previous weeks. The test cases for the grader weren't very complete. If I have any recommendations for the organizers it would be to tighten up their grading process. For one assignment, I completely forgot to write one function and there was no test coverage for it! I ended up writing it the next week. Still the codebase that they have provided for the class is large so I don't fault them for bugs. I think it will probably improve over time as more people take the course. Overall, they did a great job!",NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.5666666666666667

417,A great course as the previous courses for the specialization. I know that the week 4's materials are out of this specialization's scope but I think it's alright to delve in more about P and NP problems. That material is somehow still incomprehensible for me.,NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.6481481481481481

500,good course on Graph ,NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,1.0
501,Course was well paced. Assignments were relevant. Only shortcoming I believe was that the last two weeks of the course did not require any submission of a coding assignment. Only required a quiz. I feel that the course would benefit from a requirement to submit some code each week.,NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.6296296296296297
502,This was a very useful course which covered the main fundamental aspects of graphs in Java. The assignments were very interesting and challenging as well.

508,"Good course to build confidence in building a class from scratch. But, I expected more from this course. A few lectures could have been devoted to popular design patterns used in Graph problems maybe.One more assignment to actually make the students work on heuristics for solving NP-Hard problems would have been helpful.",NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.6

511,"This course was very well put together. The videos were clear and well organized. They typically contained a powerpoint presentation and little box with the presenter's head. The assignments built off of each other by reusing code from previous weeks. The test cases for the grader weren't very complete. If I have any recommendations for the organizers it would be to tighten up their grading process. For one assignment, I completely forgot to write one function and there was no test coverage for it! I ended up writing it the next week. Still the codebase that they have provided for the class is large so I don't fault them for bugs. I think it will probably improve over time as more people take the course. Overall, they did a great job!",NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.5666666666666667
