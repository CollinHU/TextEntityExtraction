The lecture videos provided all the information in a very detailed manner. There was nothing more I could ask for. Overall it was a great experience!!,NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.625
390,"I'm graduated in System Analysis, not Computer Sciences, and learned to program only by experience. After 20 years it's a good deal but still I missed the theoretical background and this always annoyed me. I knew and used to make good use of all the structures presented in this course but never could quite explain how or why, or talk in asymptotic notations. Now I can. I didn't stop here, I do take some topics to deep dive during the lectures. It's being a great experience and I only wish I could have more time to keep myself always enrolled in some course.",NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.537190082645
391,"As 2 previous courses of this specialization - the authors did a great job! I really enjoy it and learn a lot of things.

403,"This course was very well put together. The videos were clear and well organized. They typically contained a powerpoint presentation and little box with the presenter's head. The assignments built off of each other by reusing code from previous weeks. The test cases for the grader weren't very complete. If I have any recommendations for the organizers it would be to tighten up their grading process. (For one assignment, I completely forgot to write one function and there was no test coverage for it! I ended up writing it the next week.) Still the codebase that they have provided for the class is large so I don't fault them for bugs. I think it will probably improve over time as more people take the course. Overall, they did a great job!",NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.562913907285

497,good course on Graph ,NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,1.0
498,Course was well paced. Assignments were relevant. Only shortcoming I believe was that the last two weeks of the course did not require any submission of a coding assignment. Only required a quiz. I feel that the course would benefit from a requirement to submit some code each week.,NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.62962962963
499,This was a very useful course which covered the main fundamental aspects of graphs in Java. The assignments were very interesting and challenging as well.

500,"As 2 previous courses of this specialization - the authors did a great job! I really enjoy it and learn a lot of things. The workload is perfect: not too much, so you can get things done on time, but still pretty informative and intense. The way the material is presented is beyond all expectations. I really recommend this specialization to anybody looking for a good course of algorithms in Java. ",NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.582278481013

505,"Good course to build confidence in building a class from scratch. But, I expected more from this course. A few lectures could have been devoted to popular design patterns used in Graph problems maybe.One more assignment to actually make the students work on heuristics for solving NP-Hard problems would have been helpful.",NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.6
506,"Wonderful course, I will never forget the Santa example used to describe the Traveling Sales Man problem. Absolutely love all the instructors.",NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.68
507,"A few more graph algorithms and their implementations, if added to the course, would be nice.",NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.736842105263
508,"This course was very well put together. The videos were clear and well organized. They typically contained a powerpoint presentation and little box with the presenter's head. The assignments built off of each other by reusing code from previous weeks. The test cases for the grader weren't very complete. If I have any recommendations for the organizers it would be to tighten up their grading process. (For one assignment, I completely forgot to write one function and there was no test coverage for it! I ended up writing it the next week.) Still the codebase that they have provided for the class is large so I don't fault them for bugs. I think it will probably improve over time as more people take the course. Overall, they did a great job!",NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.562913907285
509,Good,NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,1.0
