6447,one the best backend development courses on the web covers a lot of topics and yet gives you enough depth to be able to discover the rest on your own. the only problem with it is that it stall on the some basic stuff and then accelerates a little when it comes to the more advanced techniques.,ngZrURn5EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.6271186440677966

The instructor is not showing us the way we should think about developing programs in NodeJS, but he insists on using PowerPoint slides to show us how to code! It's 2016, and there are way better mediums for communicating with your students. Simply copying and pasting code and explaining what every line does is not the right way of teaching any concept, especially when you are dealing with a new technology. For the start, the instructor can actually type the code and explain what goes through his mind during each step. That way anyone can follow his problem solving methods and benefit from the course.

6563,Not a very good course. The assignments are not very clear. Could have done much more like integrating front-end etc in place of that loopback module. Was really disappointed with this one. Should have given 0 stars but gave 3 stars for Jogesh Muppala as he is my favourite teacher when it comes to MOOC,ngZrURn5EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.6721311475409836

6568,A good introductory course spanning full-stack server side development. I liked the structured flow of lessons and excercises. A great minus though is that this course has little to none focus on testing. While in the middle of this course I lack insight into testing strategies with node js.,ngZrURn5EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.6363636363636364

6602,i do not understand why do i need in the videos see the face of the lecturer? i rather see the whole screen of code slides why do i need to see him talk? in every site of videos like pluralsight etc u do not see the lecturer. concerning this course.. i was a bit disappointed i thought it would give me more profound knowledge on node. but it was cool. ,ngZrURn5EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.5454545454545454

6609,one the best backend development courses on the web covers a lot of topics and yet gives you enough depth to be able to discover the rest on your own. the only problem with it is that it stall on the some basic stuff and then accelerates a little when it comes to the more advanced techniques.,ngZrURn5EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.6271186440677966
