924,"Overall this course does have some good content and delivers big data concepts. However, as others have mentioned some content (especially in early modules) could either be combined or ommited. Key focus areas on Spark and MongoDB are not given enough focus and lab time. The quizes have badly worded questions. Finally the last assignment required to pass the class has bad directions and covers content not reviewed in the class. Spent a frustrating amount of time trying to get what most likely is simple code to work. I'm hoping this particular module is revised.

989,The lectures were very structured and informative. The quizes were challenging. The final week was demanding and fleshed out concepts,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.545454545455
990,It was a very helpful course in understanding of the Big Data Integration and Processing. Learned a lot. Thanks to the instructors and Coursera team.,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.678571428571
991,I had many problems with the final two programming assignments with running Spark in the VM and there isn't a lot of help available online. ,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.642857142857
992,Good last week practice!!,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.8
993,"Very challenging, specially in the week 6 quizzes where a lot of researching took place in order to pass it. ",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.681818181818
994,Excellent..but not easy. Be prepared to have to do some research! But hey....isn't that part of being a data scientist!,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.689655172414
995, Great course! The practices were very useful to me to understand the subjects. ,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6
996,Awful,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,1.0
997,"The final assessment somewhat not really well designed, imho.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.727272727273
998,Needs more depth. Instructors should reference more external readings since the lectures are brief.,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.625
999,Good experience of using the big data tools but a total lack of engagement in the forums by the instructors and community mentors make it hard going if anything goes wrong. The final quiz took me over 8 hours mostly because there was no one to ask for hints when I was totally stuck and confused! ,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.724137931034
1000,"Course is well balanced between theory and practical exercises. Assignments in week 6 for me was challenging but very instructive. I learned many interesting, and useful in real world, things.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.657142857143
1001,"Overall this course does have some good content and delivers big data concepts. However, as others have mentioned some content (especially in early modules) could either be combined or ommited. Key focus areas on Spark and MongoDB are not given enough focus and lab time. The quizes have badly worded questions. Finally the last assignment required to pass the class has bad directions and covers content not reviewed in the class. Spent a frustrating amount of time trying to get what most likely is simple code to work. I'm hoping this particular module is revised. For those just interested in learning Spark or Mongo and not doing the certificate program you can probably get better learning from doing your own research.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.55223880597
1002,Great course !!!,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.666666666667
1003,I recommend more practical work but as an introductory course it is OK.,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.857142857143
1004,Quizes are inconsistent with given dataset. Questions are bad: i.e. what is the difference between number of distinct countries mentioned and number of countries mentioned in tweets.,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.515151515152
1005,"This is a very descent to understand MongoDB and Apache Spark. It contains hands on assignments will will allow you to learn how to handle these two software. The course is introductory level, and I recommend this course to people who have not used MongoDB and Apache Spark.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.596153846154
1006,It's good,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.75
1007,I tried giving zero stars. This course is very poor. In particular the last portion of the class wherein you are tested on things that were not taught. If I had wanted to spend hours in google trying to learn this stuff I would not have spent money on this course.,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.654545454545
1008,"Loved it! Very practical and hands-on, with a variety of platforms used on practical examples. I'm off to analyse some social media data soon just for fun :)",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.657142857143
1009,"I felt this module, like most, represented good value for money. It's obviously not exhaustive, but you shouldn't expect it to be for the price.The final quiz was a nice challenge and struck a good balance between course material and requiring you to research information online.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.649122807018
1010,The course cost too much for the gain of knowledge. Feels like this course could be merge with the first or the third course.,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.692307692308
1011,"Forcing users to install demo software which requires a registration is just too lame.Other than that, courser is very boring, introductory, jumps constantly between things and doesn't explain much. Stack overflow and 2 hours would do a better job.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.604166666667
