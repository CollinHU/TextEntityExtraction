994,Content was good however we need to get more support on hands on as sometime we feel that we are stuck due to non availability of the right ,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.8214285714285714
995,"Some of the lectures seemed slightly lesser quality with regards to the materials. For moocs especially, I would like to have the lecture better documented in order to download and review later.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6
996,"Poorly designed, no help whatsoever from the staff, Forum is totally worthless. Worst course I ever had on Coursera.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.7826086956521741
997,"I feel the contents of this course were great, no second thought on it. It makes your concepts crystal clear. But faced lots of issues during practicing the hands on exercises and did not get proper feedback or response on any of the queries.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.625
998,"It was a good course, different data sources and spark in action",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.8461538461538461
999,The lectures were very structured and informative. The quizes were challenging. The final week was demanding and fleshed out concepts,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.5454545454545454
1000,It was a very helpful course in understanding of the Big Data Integration and Processing. Learned a lot. Thanks to the instructors and Coursera team.,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6785714285714286
1001,I had many problems with the final two programming assignments with running Spark in the VM and there isn't a lot of help available online. ,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6428571428571429
1002,Good last week practice!!,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.8
1003,"Very challenging, specially in the week 6 quizzes where a lot of researching took place in order to pass it. ",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6818181818181818
1004,Excellent..but not easy. Be prepared to have to do some research! But hey....isn't that part of being a data scientist!,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6896551724137931
1005, Great course! The practices were very useful to me to understand the subjects. ,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6
1006,Awful,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,1.0
1007,"The final assessment somewhat not really well designed, imho.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.7272727272727273
1008,Needs more depth. Instructors should reference more external readings since the lectures are brief.,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.625
1009,Good experience of using the big data tools but a total lack of engagement in the forums by the instructors and community mentors make it hard going if anything goes wrong. The final quiz took me over 8 hours mostly because there was no one to ask for hints when I was totally stuck and confused! ,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.7241379310344828
1010,"Course is well balanced between theory and practical exercises. Assignments in week 6 for me was challenging but very instructive. I learned many interesting, and useful in real world, things.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6571428571428571
1011,"Overall this course does have some good content and delivers big data concepts. However, as others have mentioned some content especially in early modules could either be combined or ommited. Key focus areas on Spark and MongoDB are not given enough focus and lab time. The quizes have badly worded questions. Finally the last assignment required to pass the class has bad directions and covers content not reviewed in the class. Spent a frustrating amount of time trying to get what most likely is simple code to work. I'm hoping this particular module is revised. For those just interested in learning Spark or Mongo and not doing the certificate program you can probably get better learning from doing your own research.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.5606060606060606
1012,Great course !!!,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6666666666666666
1013,I recommend more practical work but as an introductory course it is OK.,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.8571428571428571
1014,Quizes are inconsistent with given dataset. Questions are bad i.e. what is the difference between number of distinct countries mentioned and number of countries mentioned in tweets.,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.53125
1015,"This is a very descent to understand MongoDB and Apache Spark. It contains hands on assignments will will allow you to learn how to handle these two software. The course is introductory level, and I recommend this course to people who have not used MongoDB and Apache Spark.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.5961538461538461
1016,It's good,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.75
1017,I tried giving zero stars. This course is very poor. In particular the last portion of the class wherein you are tested on things that were not taught. If I had wanted to spend hours in google trying to learn this stuff I would not have spent money on this course.,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6545454545454545
1018,"Loved it! Very practical and hands-on, with a variety of platforms used on practical examples. I'm off to analyse some social media data soon just for fun ",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6764705882352942
1019,"I felt this module, like most, represented good value for money. It's obviously not exhaustive, but you shouldn't expect it to be for the price.The final quiz was a nice challenge and struck a good balance between course material and requiring you to research information online.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6491228070175439
1020,The course cost too much for the gain of knowledge. Feels like this course could be merge with the first or the third course.,uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6923076923076923
1021,"Forcing users to install demo software which requires a registration is just too lame.Other than that, courser is very boring, introductory, jumps constantly between things and doesn't explain much. Stack overflow and 2 hours would do a better job.",uWrCG9mpEeWkdgqomU4otw,0.6041666666666666
