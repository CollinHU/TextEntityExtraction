6702,"Some of the concepts after week 2 were very tough for new begineer's in JAVA language. Moreover concepts of ArrayList, Generics, HashMap, Abstract Data Types should have been discussed in short videos before the module in which it is to be implemented to such a great extent.Overall a great course for someone looking to gain confidence on working large projects.

6706,"Came from the predecessor specialization by Duke, which was really great. So I had high expectations for this course.But this course introduces not much new only some library using , no new programming concepts. I also didn't like the programming assignments one big project . They were not challenging at all much too easy , and also not really interesting repetition and expansion of an assignment at Dukes . You are also not writing that much code, because you get too much from them, where you just have to add a little here and there. Liked, that they divided the videos into different stages core, concept challenge, when I struggled , so you only have to watch the videos, that you find necessary.I hope the next course will be more interesting and challenging.",NFiJtRnpEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,0.5133333333333333

There was too much focus on high-level details of the course project and too little attention paid to technical details. This rendered the lectures simplistic, boring, and sometimes a waste of time.

So I had high expectations for this course.But this course introduces not much new only some library using , no new programming concepts. I also didn't like the programming assignments one big project . They were not challenging at all much too easy , and also not really interesting repetition and expansion of an assignment at Dukes . You are also not writing that much code, because you get too much from them, where you just have to add a little here and there. Liked, that they divided the videos into different stages core, concept challenge, when I struggled , so you only have to watch the videos, that you find necessary.I hope the next course will be more interesting and challenging.",NFiJtRnpEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,0.5133333333333333

7422,"The only complaint I have about this course is the horribly irritating music at the beginning of each lecture video. I would have my headphones in, volume up so I could hear the lecturers clearly, then when the next video would start there would be this terrible music that started very abruptly. If I was very quick I could mute my volume until it finished, but I think this is totally unnecessary.

7424,"Great introduction to OOP with Java. This is not a pure theoretical course, neither a entirely practical course... It is both, so the instructors present the material with a good balance between theory and practice. Part of your assignment tasks is to explore on Java classes and learn how to use their methods functions in your own programs, which gives you a taste of a daily programmer job. The end of course project stimulates your creativity!Nonetheless, this course will be challenging for someone who has not been exposed to any OOP concepts before.
