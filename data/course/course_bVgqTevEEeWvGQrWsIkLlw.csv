10308,Useful as introductory course on NLP. Recommended for anyone who wants to begin on this discipline.,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.6666666666666666
10309,Nice course on text mining.,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.8333333333333334
10310,"A really interesting course which covers theoretically most of the text mining techniques. I missed having more practical exercise, which could help to deeply understand the lectures. Setting up the environment for the development task is a little bit complicated, it might be interesting to provide a virtual machine with all the software and correct versions required. Even though, I would recommend this course if you are interested on the topic.",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.6538461538461539

10312,The content is really good but the course has too much theory. Mixing it with some practical programming assignments would have been very nice,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.76
10313,"I think the course has very limited practical problems; so for beginners in NLP and text analytics, it is very difficult to grasp all the theoretical concepts presented in the course.",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.5882352941176471
10314,While I did not do the assignments. The videos and explanations included were top notch!,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.6470588235294118

10318,This is a very good course. I think it provides a very good foundation of text mining and analytics like PLSA and LDA. More advanced research discussed in the last lecture is also very interesting.,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.6578947368421053
10319,"Annoyingly, the specific pre-requisites can't be determined until AFTER enrolling. This course is in C++, so if you're not a C++ programmer, it's probably not a good idea to purchase this.",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.6222222222222222
10320,"Excellent course, the pipeline they propose to help you understand text mining is quite helpful. It has an important introduction to the most key concepts and techniques for text mining and analytics. ",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.6857142857142857
10321,"The material of the course is very well organized, and presented. The examples and application use cased are interesting and clearly demonstrated. With Machine Learning background, it is very easy to understanding and grasp the theories, the althorithms and put them into practice.

10328,"I would recommend this course to everyone who wants to know much more about theoric part of text mining. For pratices, I'd recommend the data camp courses...

10329,"the course is very helpful in giving the overall flavor of text mining and analytics. I would recommend to reduce the number of math work and focus on the conceptual level along with more application that could be used.

10330,"Forums were poorly organized and not well participated in. There was no forum topic for the honors assignment.Honors assignment appeared to require unix, which was not stated in the course requirements.Honors assignment was due too early in the term.",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.5217391304347826

10332,"This is an excellent course that captures many different text mining techniques. It requires some math knowledge in numerical analysis and probability in order to understand the concepts. I gave 4 star rating due to 2 problems during the course 1 Lack of examples along the formulas and principles. There are some, but many concepts could be adopted much faster if examples were introduced right along with them. 2 The optional programming exercises are easy to complete, but the environment is very confusing to set it up.

10337,The course focuses more on the theoretical side with no practical examples. It also does not explain these theoretical concepts in detail enough. It was difficult for me as a new learner in the text analytics field to follow such dense theoretical concepts.,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.7173913043478259
