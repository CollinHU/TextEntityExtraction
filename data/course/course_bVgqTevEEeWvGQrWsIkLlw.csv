10259,Useful as introductory course on NLP. Recommended for anyone who wants to begin on this discipline.,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.666666666667
10260,Nice course on text mining.,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.833333333333
10261,"A really interesting course which covers theoretically most of the text mining techniques. I missed having more practical exercise, which could help to deeply understand the lectures. Setting up the environment for the development task is a little bit complicated, it might be interesting to provide a virtual machine with all the software and correct versions required. Even though, I would recommend this course if you are interested on the topic.",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.653846153846
10262,Awesome!,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.5
10263,The content is really good but the course has too much theory. Mixing it with some practical programming assignments would have been very nice,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.76
10264,"I think the course has very limited practical problems; so for beginners in NLP and text analytics, it is very difficult to grasp all the theoretical concepts presented in the course.",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.588235294118
10265,While I did not do the assignments. The videos and explanations included were top notch!,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.647058823529

10268,Very good course thank you I wish we could have use case applications with high level tools such as RThanks a lot again !,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.833333333333
10269,This is a very good course. I think it provides a very good foundation of text mining and analytics like PLSA and LDA. More advanced research discussed in the last lecture is also very interesting.,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.657894736842
10270,"Annoyingly, the specific pre-requisites can't be determined until AFTER enrolling. This course is in C++, so if you're not a C++ programmer, it's probably not a good idea to purchase this.",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.622222222222
10271,"Excellent course, the pipeline they propose to help you understand text mining is quite helpful. It has an important introduction to the most key concepts and techniques for text mining and analytics. ",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.685714285714
10272,"The material of the course is very well organized, and presented. The examples and application use cased are interesting and clearly demonstrated. With Machine Learning background, it is very easy to understanding and grasp the theories, the althorithms and put them into practice. I highly recommend this course to anyone who has a ML background and would like to work on NLP problems.",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.557142857143

10278,Very comprehensive introduction to text mining. It serves well as a First Class to text mining and analytics!,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.7
10279,"I would recommend this course to everyone who wants to know much more about theoric part of text mining. For pratices, I'd recommend the data camp courses... I think the join of this platforms, could result in a better experience, because you can pratice the theorical knowledge gained here, regards =) !",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.6
10280,"the course is very helpful in giving the overall flavor of text mining and analytics. I would recommend to reduce the number of math work and focus on the conceptual level along with more application that could be used. For the math part, adding optional videos for more details about math will be very useful and helpful",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.666666666667
10281,"Forums were poorly organized and not well participated in. There was no forum topic for the honors assignment.Honors assignment appeared to require unix, which was not stated in the course requirements.Honors assignment was due too early in the term.",bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.521739130435

10283,"This is an excellent course that captures many different text mining techniques. It requires some math knowledge in numerical analysis and probability in order to understand the concepts. I gave 4 star rating due to 2 problems during the course: 1) Lack of examples along the formulas and principles. There are some, but many concepts could be adopted much faster if examples were introduced right along with them. 2) The optional programming exercises are easy to complete, but the environment is very confusing to set it up.

10288,The course focuses more on the theoretical side with no practical examples. It also does not explain these theoretical concepts in detail enough. It was difficult for me as a new learner in the text analytics field to follow such dense theoretical concepts.,bVgqTevEEeWvGQrWsIkLlw,0.717391304348
