1017,Tough speed - learning effect created by the weekly assignments. Good start into data sience.,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.647058823529
1018,"The course is overall very good and is definitely a very complete introduction to the topic.Sometimes I found the pace of the course a bit too fast: it's quite difficult to focus on the Professor's explanations and, at the very same time, follow the commands typed on the jupyter notebook (not to mention reproducing them on my own!!). The python exercises are overall quite well done, even though in some parts they could benefit from clearer explanations (thankfully almost always provided in the discussion section). Be careful that often the programming assignments go beyond what has been explained in the lectures and therefore require an active search in the documentation, on online forum such as stack overflow or in the resources section.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.557971014493

Good experience, and I plan on continuing with the specialization.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.672413793103
1041,"This is a very helpful course. The main advantage is that you will learn a lot of new ways to do operations over data. And this is an intermediary course that assumes that you already know about statistics, mathematics behind data. From my experience I want to tell that if you are taking this course don't just rely on the video this course provide (however videos gives you full context on the work that has to be done), you have to do your own research and reading from external sources too. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.59

1043,"Course was good , i wish number of exercises were more.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.75
1044,"Excellent course, and very well taught. The projects are a bit difficult for beginners and will require independent learning as well as revising the lectures, but such is anything important in life.The only thing I think the course can benefit from is a printed summary of lectures, since they can be quite dense with information! But I think the Jupyter Notebooks are a good inclusion as is.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.573333333333

1056,"A very clear introduction to using Pandas for handling data. The integration of Jupyter Notebooks in both the assignments and the in-lecture pop-ups was very effective. I also appreciated the balance of covering most of the material in lectures, but leaving you to track down some things for the assignments. I can only hope the next courses in this progression are this well done. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.534246575342

1092,Good through introduction to using Pandas. Instruction needs to go into more examples and explanations. I needed to use stackoverflow to get through 60% of the assignments. Few assignment questions are ambiguous and I never found out why my answer is incorrect. Where's the solutions?,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.547169811321
1093,Excellent course to learn about pandas and numpy,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.75

1095,"An excellent course, which requires more self learning than what is taught. I extended the course and completed the final assignment in a week. The assignments involving data cleaning actually helps a budding data scientist. Documentation, Stack Overflow for assignments is a must which can boost your understanding not just for this course but for a lot more. My personal satisfaction about this course is mainly stackoverflow part which helped me to understand the lectures weeks ahead. But application of the concepts on assignments is a difficult one which can only be mastered after practice. Thanks to all mentors, especially Sophie Greene whom I followed a lot. Her debugs, algos and code checks have actually helped me to understand both python and Pandas better. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5
1096,"The assignments of the course are hard and make you go deep into python, to try to find the answers. I spent more time than I expected on it, but once my target is knowledge I really enjoy.

1181,"For me the course's biggest value-adding point is to simply ask us to Google everything on Stack Overflow to complete all the assignments, which has almost nothing to do with the course content. The assignments are also badly designed. In the discussion forum you can see lots of confused / frustrated posts. The TA's and mentors are clearly under-resourced to answer all our questions. The videos unfortunately don't teach us much either. The professor + TA's a simply reading off a teleprompter, and they're rushing through everything.

1185,The video classes are informative and very clear. The exercises during the classes were thorough and allowed me to apprehend the concepts at a good pace. My only problem were the auto-graded exams. Sometimes the questions are not crystal clear and the auto-grader isn't intelligent enough to discern between a logical mistake and some detail about table formatting. Fortunately these problems are discussed in the forums and usually one can get clues on what they can be from the mentors.,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.549450549451

1201,"I learned so much. However, the lack of support when I got stuck made it a frustrating experience. I would not have been able to pass without the discussion forum tips. Even then, it was a lot of mucking in the dark and assignments took longer to complete than they should have. I'm glad I took the course but it was not designed for someone at my skill level. If the discussion forum was organized in a better way, it would have helped -- I had to scroll through pages of text to find the right tips to identify my mistakes.

Really nice, pleasant video, but don't expect to learn how to solve the problems, because there is little connection from the problems to the videos.Teaching assistants are hard -working and knowledgable and each has a different way to do things.Very little in the way of effective educational design.But they do create useful questions to answer, if you are stubborn enough not to need actual instruction.The estimate of time required is woefully inadequate.The best thing you can do is lookup Brandon Rhodes on Youtube. He will actually explain Pandas. Expect to invest about four hours in his videos and still have questions. Use the course forum extensively ??? only there will you get a hint of how to do what they ask.Google and Stack Overflow: that's their extensive list of references.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.506024096386
1254,This course was really worth paying!!!Thank you for providing this course!,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.714285714286
1255,"I found that the videos weren't entirely helpful when tackling the assignments. I had to outsource most, if not all, of my inquiries to external sources (read: stack overflow). Even simple things such as advanced indexing, such as multi-indexing, was unclear. I understand that not everything can be covered, but I feel that basic things should be. Other than that, I enjoyed using the Jupyter notebook, and thought this was integrated very nicely into the coursework.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5
1256,"The course was helpful in presenting typical problems in data science, but the lectures showed you examples in one area of pandas and the assignments asked questions in different areas of pandas. I found the assignments frustrating and spent much of my time trying to understand what they were asking rather than actually solving the problems.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.508474576271
1257,Excellent course. It really motivated me to work very hard to make all assignments on time,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.764705882353
1258,"I enjoyed and found all of the lectures helpful, but lack of feedback after submitting assignments was a real problem, especially for the last assignment. A simple response of this was answered incorrectly, points not awarded isn't very constructive and was often frustrating. Bugs in being able to submit the assignment were also frustrating. I spent a good amount of time trying to fix my code, thinking it was incorrect, when in actuality the online submission was just not working.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.56043956044
1259,"The course content and assignments are pretty good at covering the fundamentals of how to manipulate data in python, I did learn a lot that I can see my self applying practically. Where it falls down though is the assignment auto-grader. It's immensely fussy (as I understand it has to be), but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don't sufficiently explicitly define whats expected. This means you spend more than 50% of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so.I would recommend this course, but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.569230769231

Before the class, I took a intro class to Python in my school covering basic commands, and thought this Coursera course would be kind of easy. But it turned out to be a very intensive one. I take more than 6 hours to complete the homework.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.625
1265,It's a great course! The assignment is amazing! It takes me several hours or even one or two days to finish it. I have to say the assignment is really valuable. Professor Brook is also great and the video is greatly filmed. It's worth taking if you have already learned some of python and want to know more about python in data analysis.

1290,"This course has greatly helped my understanding of not only some python, but pandas as well. My only suggestion to anyone that wants to take this course is to make sure to allocate as much time as possible to it. They give estimates as to how long it should take you to complete a week's worth of material, but this can vary highly from person to person. Overall, I enjoyed!",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.569620253165

1292,"Course lectures were good, tho at times a little too rapid. The python text appears and disappears too fast to digest, I did a lot of pausing. The early exercises were good, but later ones were finicky. I would prefer more intermediate steps to confirm we're on the right track. In particular the last (huge) exercise was frustrating, just being told I've got it wrong with no feedback on why. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.588235294118
1293,"This course would be great if you are experienced in Python or any other programming language. The title ' Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required.' is very misleading and if you do not have any experience, you will struggle a lot especially to complete week 3 &amp; 4 assignments. It makes you think and requires a lot of self-study, which is a good way to enhance our knowledge and skills, however assignments are way too challenging for those who are 'beginners' or have little real-world experience. I would not recommend if you do not have much confidence in your programming 'experience'.Having said that, teaching team is great - very knowledgeable and supportive.

The lectures are crisp and clear, but the main learning happens while doing the weekly assignments. Each assignment forces us to go search for content beyond what has been taught in the lectures and in this process we find new things. Also, the lecturer informed us about some good reference books for individual learning. I look forward to taking part two of this course. The mentors in the discussions forum are quite active and helpful. The forum was of big help to me for clearing the assignments. The only flaw I found was that the autograder does not clearly define our mistakes and that's where the mentors come in and explain in the discussion forum. This part could be better automated.

1380,I learned in this course that pandas is a way deeper rabbit hole than it appears on the surface. However rather than teaching me pandas this course mostly just helped me verify that I was learning pandas. The questions in this class need more scaffolding. I ended up skipping most of the in-video questions because I felt that the work I was investing in getting them correct was not teaching me much. More scaffolding could fix this. ,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.535714285714

Another problem when submitting your assignment is that students have to SAVE changes in order for the new code to take effect. Last but not least, the reading of the grading report is unclear.

So for Syllabus content I think you are doing veryy wellCons: Nearly all the problems I encountered were related to the autograder not being helpful! There could be better error handling/debugging i.e. instead of just saying the answer is wrong, explain why and the aswer that is expected. For example, I spent DAYS on the final question (run ttest)of the last assignment.

1572,"This was way above my level knowledge. One will definitely a strong level of knowledge in stats and data analysis to begin with. The Python part is but only a tool in this module / course. For that reason I found the tutorials way too fast paced. I had to go back on everything and test, so a 5 mins tutorial video would sometimes take me 30 mins or longer to complete.The 3 hour / 4 hour assessments took me days! Yet - a great way to jump into something new! The course itself is great. The presentation and content is just as great.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.582608695652

There is one thing I hope the course can improved, which probably has been mentioned in the forum for many times: the auto-grader is not flexible that it doesn't grant any points to answers that is slightly different from the submitted form (e.g. upper/lower cases, white space, etc.) and we have a hard time figuring out what exactly the auto-grader is accepting. I would suggest modifying the auto-grader such that it allows flexibility in answer acceptance, or breaking down questions into smaller parts (more partial credits) and give more precise/detailed description on the format of answer expected.

Update: I'm lowering my grade from 4 stars to 3 stars because of very confusing assignments. Often it's not clear the requirement of the task. It takes very long to understand.

The python exercises are overall quite well done, even though in some parts they could benefit from clearer explanations (thankfully almost always provided in the discussion section).

The assignments are also badly designed. In the discussion forum you can see lots of confused / frustrated posts. The TA's and mentors are clearly under-resourced to answer all our questions.

1766,The video classes are informative and very clear. The exercises during the classes were thorough and allowed me to apprehend the concepts at a good pace. My only problem were the auto-graded exams.

1809,A very interesting and useful course for those who want to learn how to clean data in Python.I loved the opportunity to work directly on the notebook as I was listening to lectures.I think that more emphasis should have been put in the pros and cons why and how of using the pandas lib. functions in order to accomplish tasks.Assignments were very instructive and well explained by staff in the Discussion ForumMany thanks to the staff and to U. of Michigan for the course. ,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.516129032258

1812,"The whole curse relies on the automated grading system, which is still a little sloppy. I think it would be useful to have one notebook or cheatsheet with all the important functions. And also, I personally like to have a reference assignment that was completed by the instructors. This could be provided before or after the course, but the way I really learn is by reading other peoples code and seeing ways to code problems. Thanks",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.614457831325

1814,Great course!! I've enjoyed the assignments very much - from my part it required a a lot of individual investigation / reading through posts to find possible solutions but that's only fair since this is an intermediate course. It was a fantastic experience as the assignments felt like real projects. Thanks for everyone making this course possible! Daniel ,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.621212121212

1830,"Very good introduction to Pandas Series and DataFrames for Data Science. Fast paced course with good supplementary materials. The homework is progressively challenging. Sophie the Teaching Assistant is particularly helpful in the forums. I don't recommend this course for those without programming or python scripting experience. Also, the homework exercises took me significantly longer than the estimates projected, but I budgeted about double the time and was able to complete the course on time.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.559523809524

Really nice, pleasant video, but don't expect to learn how to solve the problems, because there is little connection from the problems to the videos.Teaching assistants are hard -working and knowledgable and each has a different way to do things.Very little in the way of effective educational design.But they do create useful questions to answer, if you are stubborn enough not to need actual instruction.The estimate of time required is woefully inadequate.The best thing you can do is lookup Brandon Rhodes on Youtube. He will actually explain Pandas. Expect to invest about four hours in his videos and still have questions. Use the course forum extensively ??? only there will you get a hint of how to do what they ask.Google and Stack Overflow: that's their extensive list of references.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.506024096386

1833,"I found that the videos weren't entirely helpful when tackling the assignments. I had to outsource most, if not all, of my inquiries to external sources (read: stack overflow). Even simple things such as advanced indexing, such as multi-indexing, was unclear. I understand that not everything can be covered, but I feel that basic things should be. Other than that, I enjoyed using the Jupyter notebook, and thought this was integrated very nicely into the coursework.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5
1834,"The course was helpful in presenting typical problems in data science, but the lectures showed you examples in one area of pandas and the assignments asked questions in different areas of pandas.

1836,"I enjoyed and found all of the lectures helpful, but lack of feedback after submitting assignments was a real problem, especially for the last assignment. A simple response of this was answered incorrectly, points not awarded isn't very constructive and was often frustrating. Bugs in being able to submit the assignment were also frustrating. I spent a good amount of time trying to fix my code, thinking it was incorrect, when in actuality the online submission was just not working.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.56043956044
1837,"The course content and assignments are pretty good at covering the fundamentals of how to manipulate data in python, I did learn a lot that I can see my self applying practically. Where it falls down though is the assignment auto-grader. It's immensely fussy (as I understand it has to be), but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don't sufficiently explicitly define whats expected. This means you spend more than 50% of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so.I would recommend this course, but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.569230769231

No prior experience required.' is very misleading and if you do not have any experience, you will struggle a lot especially to complete week 3 &amp; 4 assignments. It makes you think and requires a lot of self-study, which is a good way to enhance our knowledge and skills, however assignments are way too challenging for those who are 'beginners' or have little real-world experience.

The lectures are crisp and clear, but the main learning happens while doing the weekly assignments. Each assignment forces us to go search for content beyond what has been taught in the lectures and in this process we find new things. Also, the lecturer informed us about some good reference books for individual learning. I look forward to taking part two of this course. The mentors in the discussions forum are quite active and helpful. The forum was of big help to me for clearing the assignments. The only flaw I found was that the autograder does not clearly define our mistakes and that's where the mentors come in and explain in the discussion forum. This part could be better automated.

1908,This course was over all okay. My primary complaints are that I felt that the class moved too quickly and relied too heavily on students to teach themselves through the Pandas documentation.

How to access and change elements in a data frame (especially the use of loc and iloc) is not explained very well and I believe there is an error in the slides. The second thing is that I have found more powerful methods in pandas documentation, for example assign() or nlargest() and nsmallest(). This is not really a problem if one of the hidden purposes is to push students to actively search the docs for what they would like to do.Work load for the assignments is just fine in my opinion, not too little, not too much.Overall I am satisfied.

1950,I learned in this course that pandas is a way deeper rabbit hole than it appears on the surface. However rather than teaching me pandas this course mostly just helped me verify that I was learning pandas. The questions in this class need more scaffolding. I ended up skipping most of the in-video questions because I felt that the work I was investing in getting them correct was not teaching me much. More scaffolding could fix this. ,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.535714285714

The downside is, I feel like the grading some what less intuitive. For example, in may assignments, student has to import pandas or numpy in each and every function in order to get the score. Another problem when submitting your assignment is that students have to SAVE changes in order for the new code to take effect. Last but not least, the reading of the grading report is unclear.

Not much 'actual Data Science' is covered in the course, however. It's more practically-oriented in the sense that it deals with data preparation (loading, cleaning and merging data).

So for Syllabus content I think you are doing veryy wellCons: Nearly all the problems I encountered were related to the autograder not being helpful! There could be better error handling/debugging i.e. instead of just saying the answer is wrong, explain why and the aswer that is expected. For example, I spent DAYS on the final question (run ttest)of the last assignment.

2118,"The course was great - the lectures were clear and simple; I learned a great deal! However, instructions for the assessments could have been clearer, and there were a few issues with the autograder (though I'm sure those will be weeded out).",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.58
2119,"Even short, but give a hint and big picture how data science works",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.928571428571
2120,"This course was excellent...I first found the course odd since the instructor went through the material quite quickly in the lectures. It took me a while to figure out that the material was available as a course download. Once I found that it was easy to follow along with the instructor...need two monitors ideally for this to work. If you cannot step through the Jupyter notebook as the instructor goes through the material, you will be lost...and you will not get the most out of the class.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.540816326531
2121,"The course is good and provide great challenges to do a lot of things with Python and Pandas. However, I find that its resource material sometimes lacking complex examples. This may be intentional in order for the students to learn from external resources as well. However, this can also causes difficulties for people who are not already familiar with Pandas before they start following the course.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.652777777778
2122,This course is a challenging (and solid) introduction to using python.,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.642857142857
2123,"This was way above my level knowledge. One will definitely a strong level of knowledge in stats and data analysis to begin with. The Python part is but only a tool in this module / course. For that reason I found the tutorials way too fast paced. I had to go back on everything and test, so a 5 mins tutorial video would sometimes take me 30 mins or longer to complete.The 3 hour / 4 hour assessments took me days! Yet - a great way to jump into something new! The course itself is great. The presentation and content is just as great.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.582608695652
2124,I like the course very much. It was fun to learn and to do the exercises. There were some rough edges in the assignments but I'm sure these will be straightened out in time.,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.666666666667
2125,"The content and assignments are certainly useful and relevant. However, the lectures are too short and do not help much with doing the assignment. As a beginner, I relied heavily on google and the discussion forum to get through the assignment. And I am not sure if i can actually tackle similar problems again without referring back to the pre-mentioned resources.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.550724637681
2126,Excellent! A little harder for new students in python but very interesting!,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.785714285714
2127,More concise coding tutorials and less search on your own on the internet needed. It is great to get to know the online community and the course needs more coding example directly relat to exams.,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.540540540541
2128,"Wow, this course was intense but worth it!",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.8
2129,A great introductory class to data science with challenging assignments to build a solid understanding of pandas and numpy . ,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.65
2130,"It is useful, but there are some notable flaws. My biggest problems were with the clarity of the assignment questions (some were unacceptably vague) and the feedback that the autograder gives. Fortunately, fellow classmates on the forums are extremely helpful in figuring this all out.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.576923076923
2131,"Excellent class. Needs a little work to make sure assignments a little more clear, but with a bit of work from the student, it's a great learning experience. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.676470588235
2132,"I like the content covered in the lectures. That's very useful for me to clean data parsed from webpages. There is one thing I hope the course can improved, which probably has been mentioned in the forum for many times: the auto-grader is not flexible that it doesn't grant any points to answers that is slightly different from the submitted form (e.g. upper/lower cases, white space, etc.) and we have a hard time figuring out what exactly the auto-grader is accepting. I would suggest modifying the auto-grader such that it allows flexibility in answer acceptance, or breaking down questions into smaller parts (more partial credits) and give more precise/detailed description on the format of answer expected. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.513698630137
2133,"Really good course BUT be prepared for a very fast pace of the lectures. I'd placed in the advance beginner or intermediate low level, therefore, you need to have previous knowledge of Python. As in College, lectures and assignments are somewhat related, but you will spend some additional time investigating by yourself to get the appropriate responses. Again, just like College where Lectures are level 2-3 but assignments are level 7-8 (out of 10).",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.566666666667
2134,I thank so much professor Brooks and the team of the cours. ,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.692307692308
2135,"Awsome course with good balance betweern Challange,Reasearch and Progression.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5
2136,"Although the tests can be a bit fiddly, this is a great course if you already have a bit of background with Python and/or data cleaning. Lecture and tutorial videos are lean and information-dense. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.682926829268
2137,"Really awesome course. It is a kind of do it yourself course.The assignments are tough to crack. I think a little bit of programming experience is neccessary. The lectures themselves only give the basic knowledge. The assignments make you do research on the relevant topics. The autograder is pretty bad, it gives false negatives a lot of times, but that i believe is Coursera's drawback and they are working on it.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.518072289157
2138,"Very challenging course. And I thought I knew Python. I learned much, much more about Pandas, idioms, lambdas, regex, etc. I will be able to be more productive at work with all this. Thanks.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5
2139,"Excellent course, I learned a lot especially through the assignments. Missing a fifth star because of a lot of issues with the notebooks autograding, and sometimes imprecise instructions in the assignments. Still I look forward to working on the next pandas courses!",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.553191489362
2140,Contents are great and very relative. Exam is fair and reasonable. However students have to deal with an autograder for the scores and the autograder is not up to par for this course. The amount of time that you spend on learning during the course is only a fraction of time you spend to get through the autograder. ,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.596774193548
2141,Pace of lectures is rather fast and doesn't fit to homework level (which is much harder). But overall course is OK,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.68
2142,"A good introduction to python and data science. The questions were just about the right level of difficulty. My main criticism is that the online videos were pretty short and not going into a lot of detail, whereas with the questions you had to do a lot of extra research to figure out how to solve them. More interaction with the enrolled students during the course and having more in-depth videos would make the course a lot better.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.588235294118
2143,Very nice!,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.666666666667
2144,good intro to pandas and some numpy. students need to deep dive into each subject to become proficient,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.631578947368
2145,"Good course materials and the assignment itself is pretty good, but the grader is buggy, not informative and wasted a lot of my time.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.703703703704
2146,Take this course if u can invest a lot of time in searching for stuff yourself. Content and videos are okay but the assignments are very tough,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.821428571429
2147,Great course.,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.666666666667
2148,"Amazing Training on Python Data Science, doing the course assignment its like read the book Python for data analysis. I believe this course is not trivial and is not intermediate level, is an advanced level, Is a real challenge. Definitively i recommend it. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.673469387755
2149,"A great intro to pandas. Challenging even for those with experience using the library. There were some struggles with the autogravder, but they were being worked out, and the integration of the Jupyter notebook system directly into the class is fantastic.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.608695652174
