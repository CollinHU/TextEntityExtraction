1028,"The course is overall very good and is definitely a very complete introduction to the topic.Sometimes I found the pace of the course a bit too fast it's quite difficult to focus on the Professor's explanations and, at the very same time, follow the commands typed on the jupyter notebook not to mention reproducing them on my own!! . The python exercises are overall quite well done, even though in some parts they could benefit from clearer explanations thankfully almost always provided in the discussion section . Be careful that often the programming assignments go beyond what has been explained in the lectures and therefore require an active search in the documentation, on online forum such as stack overflow or in the resources section.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5661764705882353

1051,"This is a very helpful course. The main advantage is that you will learn a lot of new ways to do operations over data. And this is an intermediary course that assumes that you already know about statistics, mathematics behind data. From my experience I want to tell that if you are taking this course don't just rely on the video this course provide however videos gives you full context on the work that has to be done , you have to do your own research and reading from external sources too.

1106,"An excellent course, which requires more self learning than what is taught. I extended the course and completed the final assignment in a week. The assignments involving data cleaning actually helps a budding data scientist. Documentation, Stack Overflow for assignments is a must which can boost your understanding not just for this course but for a lot more. My personal satisfaction about this course is mainly stackoverflow part which helped me to understand the lectures weeks ahead. But application of the concepts on assignments is a difficult one which can only be mastered after practice. Thanks to all mentors, especially Sophie Greene whom I followed a lot. Her debugs, algos and code checks have actually helped me to understand both python and Pandas better. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5

1192,"For me the course's biggest value-adding point is to simply ask us to Google everything on Stack Overflow to complete all the assignments, which has almost nothing to do with the course content. The assignments are also badly designed. In the discussion forum you can see lots of confused frustrated posts. The TA's and mentors are clearly under-resourced to answer all our questions. The videos unfortunately don't teach us much either. The professor + TA's a simply reading off a teleprompter, and they're rushing through everything.

1196,The video classes are informative and very clear. The exercises during the classes were thorough and allowed me to apprehend the concepts at a good pace. My only problem were the auto-graded exams. Sometimes the questions are not crystal clear and the auto-grader isn't intelligent enough to discern between a logical mistake and some detail about table formatting.

A simple response of this was answered incorrectly, points not awarded isn't very constructive and was often frustrating. Bugs in being able to submit the assignment were also frustrating.

Where it falls down though is the assignment auto-grader. It's immensely fussy as I understand it has to be , but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don't sufficiently explicitly define whats expected. This means you spend more than 50% of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so.I would recommend this course, but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5736434108527132

1297,"The course is fast paced and the videos do not cover all of what is necessary to know to pass the assignments. However, this is not a problem as all the necessary references are given. The problem is the way the programming assignments are designed and the automatic grader, which should definitely be improved. Some times you spend hours to figure out what is wrong and you finally find out that you have a precision error because of using a library function instead of another same purpose or you spend our to manipulate a Pandas dataframe to respond to the specifications, except that all that time is wasted as the grader will accept the first version even if the index does not respond to the requirement for instance .

The lectures are crisp and clear, but the main learning happens while doing the weekly assignments. Each assignment forces us to go search for content beyond what has been taught in the lectures and in this process we find new things. Also, the lecturer informed us about some good reference books for individual learning. I look forward to taking part two of this course. The mentors in the discussions forum are quite active and helpful. The forum was of big help to me for clearing the assignments. The only flaw I found was that the autograder does not clearly define our mistakes and that's where the mentors come in and explain in the discussion forum. This part could be better automated.

You're on your own to learn the material and you won't get timely responses if any from the staff.

1561,"A course which has great assignments. However, the video itself is a bit boring. Most of the time, my motivation to learn this course is just doing its assignments. At the same time, the assignments are somewhat difficult for those who are not familiar with Python, but for me it's just OK. What I want to make complaints about the assignments is that sometimes the Autograder is so rigid that I have to try one question over and over again until the Autograder feels happy, and for me, sometimes the gap between correct answer and incorrect answer isn't so large...And finally, thank you, teacher Christopher Brooks!

Where it falls down though is the assignment auto-grader. It's immensely fussy as I understand it has to be , but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don't sufficiently explicitly define whats expected.

The problem is the way the programming assignments are designed and the automatic grader, which should definitely be improved. Some times you spend hours to figure out what is wrong and you finally find out that you have a precision error because of using a library function instead of another same purpose or you spend our to manipulate a Pandas dataframe to respond to the specifications, except that all that time is wasted as the grader will accept the first version even if the index does not respond to the requirement for instance .

My only suggestion to anyone that wants to take this course is to make sure to allocate as much time as possible to it. They give estimates as to how long it should take you to complete a week's worth of material, but this can vary highly from person to person. Overall, I enjoyed!",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.569620253164557

1884,"Course lectures were good, tho at times a little too rapid. The python text appears and disappears too fast to digest, I did a lot of pausing. The early exercises were good, but later ones were finicky. I would prefer more intermediate steps to confirm we're on the right track. In particular the last huge exercise was frustrating, just being told I've got it wrong with no feedback on why. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.6024096385542169
1885,"This course would be great if you are experienced in Python or any other programming language. The title ' Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required.' is very misleading and if you do not have any experience, you will struggle a lot especially to complete week 3 &amp; 4 assignments. It makes you think and requires a lot of self-study, which is a good way to enhance our knowledge and skills, however assignments are way too challenging for those who are 'beginners' or have little real-world experience. I would not recommend if you do not have much confidence in your programming 'experience'.Having said that, teaching team is great - very knowledgeable and supportive.

The lectures are crisp and clear, but the main learning happens while doing the weekly assignments. Each assignment forces us to go search for content beyond what has been taught in the lectures and in this process we find new things. Also, the lecturer informed us about some good reference books for individual learning. I look forward to taking part two of this course. The mentors in the discussions forum are quite active and helpful. The forum was of big help to me for clearing the assignments. The only flaw I found was that the autograder does not clearly define our mistakes and that's where the mentors come in and explain in the discussion forum. This part could be better automated.

1980,"This was a very helpful course in getting comfortable with using the pandas library and different concepts in numpy in data analysis. The fact that the instructors and course materials do not give you 100% of the tools to complete the assignments is a plus. Every data analyst and programmer inevitably will have to rely on self-guidance. This course by itself may not be immensely useful in the professional world, but lays a strong foundation for the student to focus more on plotting, analysis, and conceptual learning, rather than on code.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5686274509803921

1984,"I liked that the course was very assignment-oriented. It had a good structure and interesting additional readings. However, for people who are not familiar with pandas library it may be very challenging to pass assignments. This minimal guidance, I believe, results not in a better understanding, but in confused students writing bad code and spending hours not understanding online documentation.

While the course-work and the presentations itsself were excellent, the homework was a real pain as very often the Auto-grader didn't work and it took me hours to get a project which was correct, to be accepted as the right solution.

Exercises are however close to challenges you face in real life. Finally, the start date was delayed and there is no clear visibility on when the other modules are started. So, the course could be better given, provide more material and be better coordinated. I followed one Python course at Rice University which was by far better given.

1994,"In general, this course is able to introduce the basics of data manipulation in pandas. Exercises are designed in a way that key python functions can be applied. The downside is, I feel like the grading some what less intuitive. For example, in may assignments, student has to import pandas or numpy in each and every function in order to get the score. Another problem when submitting your assignment is that students have to SAVE changes in order for the new code to take effect. Last but not least, the reading of the grading report is unclear.

2085,Overall I thought the level of the course was good. The programming assignments were complex and long enough that you had a good opportunity to re-inforce topics covered in the course. I already had a good bit of pandas experience so the course was helpful to re-inforce things I was already familiar with but hadn't been forced to try out. I think if you don't already have pandas experience the assignments might be tough.,RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5

2087,"This course is accurately advertised as requiring intermediate programming experience. It focusses on some of the basic python tools that are used in data science like pandas, specifically dataframes. For a python newbie like me, some of the assignments were quite challenging as they required significant additional reading and search. I would have appreciated if all of the concepts required to solve the assignments were introduced in the same week, so my additional reading and search would have been more targeted. Very little stats if any is required or taught. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5306122448979592

The projects were about the right difficulty and length although the one for week three was more time consuming than expected . They were interesting enough to keep engaged. I think the span of topics was also useful and appropriate. I would have liked if the autograder gave more detailed output on what was wrong with a submission. I also think it would be extremely beneficial to see the right ways of solving this problems after a submission is completed.

At the same time, the assignments are somewhat difficult for those who are not familiar with Python, but for me it's just OK. What I want to make complaints about the assignments is that sometimes the Autograder is so rigid that I have to try one question over and over again until the Autograder feels happy, and for me, sometimes the gap between correct answer and incorrect answer isn't so large...And finally, thank you, teacher Christopher Brooks!
