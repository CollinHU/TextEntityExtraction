5695,Very good course specialization. You can learn a lot if following closely. They gonna have to modify the course using Angular 2 in order to be relevant to the newest/modern framework. ,DzdXURoCEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.666666666667

5697,"Dear Instructors;Thank you for the excellent course and the great sessions you provided. Keeping a combination of technology, professionalism and humor in your sessions was always a great experience and brought smile to my face when following your instructions. I believe keeping this spirit in your courses will be of great help and fun for all students. Wish you well in your future teachings and online courses and hope to follow more of them in the future.Kind regards;M.Karami",DzdXURoCEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.533333333333
5698,Great overall experience. I found it quite flattering that someone who's final submission I had to grade sent in the exact same paper I sent in and provided the same links I provided to an API on areascore.ca (which is a domain I own) as well as links to repositories in my bitbucket account (which I now have made private). The only thing that would upset me is this person getting a better grade than I did. ,DzdXURoCEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.609195402299
5699,"I feel grateful that I found this course. This course is my first step as a learner in Coursera and it helps me to learn the fundamental skill that I need for my thesis, which is about CRM mobile application. It structure of this specialization is great, even though I got struggled in the capstone course because of lack explanation about IBM Bluemix.",DzdXURoCEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.602941176471

5703,"The course is well structured and Prof Muppala presents it in an interesting way. The range of technology covered was good and would be useful. The CapStone Project timelines are not realistic at all - one has to start implementing almost from the word go, the artificial interim reports are distracting if one does not realize that and I think many students are forced to a second session to complete the course.
