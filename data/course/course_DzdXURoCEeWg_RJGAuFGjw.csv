5733,Very good course specialization. You can learn a lot if following closely. They gonna have to modify the course using Angular 2 in order to be relevant to the newest modern framework. ,DzdXURoCEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.6857142857142857

5735,"Dear Instructors;Thank you for the excellent course and the great sessions you provided. Keeping a combination of technology, professionalism and humor in your sessions was always a great experience and brought smile to my face when following your instructions. I believe keeping this spirit in your courses will be of great help and fun for all students. Wish you well in your future teachings and online courses and hope to follow more of them in the future.Kind regards;M.Karami",DzdXURoCEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.5333333333333333
5736,Great overall experience. I found it quite flattering that someone who's final submission I had to grade sent in the exact same paper I sent in and provided the same links I provided to an API on areascore.ca which is a domain I own as well as links to repositories in my bitbucket account which I now have made private . The only thing that would upset me is this person getting a better grade than I did. ,DzdXURoCEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.6309523809523809
5737,"I feel grateful that I found this course. This course is my first step as a learner in Coursera and it helps me to learn the fundamental skill that I need for my thesis, which is about CRM mobile application.

5741,"The course is well structured and Prof Muppala presents it in an interesting way. The range of technology covered was good and would be useful. The CapStone Project timelines are not realistic at all - one has to start implementing almost from the word go, the artificial interim reports are distracting if one does not realize that and I think many students are forced to a second session to complete the course.
