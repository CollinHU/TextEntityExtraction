9202,"Overall it's a good intro if you know nothing or very little about those topics.That said, the class is too slow.Homework is too easy and boring. It's all about following very specific long instructions - put this line of JS here, create a function called Foo, etc.Grading is done by peers, even though it could be automated.

9211,"Structured Course that gives beginner to intermediate level expertise. Short course, so there is not much time to give challenging assignments that would prepare you for a job or industry level skill in this topic. The student enrollment was limited compared to my other courses on Coursera and hence the discussion forum was not active. There is no TA or instructor participation in discussion forum; hence my advanced questions in forum intended to learn beyond the course went unanswered.

9220,"The class has a lot of good information but I felt as though it was a bit disorganized. There were way too many people taking the class but not enough to grade the assignments. On the plus side I was able to switch to another session of the class while keeping all of my progress so hopefully my assignments will get graded this time around and I'll be able to complete the class. If an auto-grader or a way to ensure that everybody who turns in assignments will get those assignments graded back quickly could be implemented this would be a stellar class. Despite it's faults though I would still recommend it as I did learn a fair amount of HTML, CSS and JS quickly. I look forward to additional classes from this university. Thank you for your efforts.
