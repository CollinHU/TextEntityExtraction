8915,"The course and specialization looks promising but I get the feeling that the instructors have been a little lazy while designing the assignments. Instead of auto-grading using well known testing frameworks (like other Coursera courses), the entire grading policy is based on reviews from fellow students which makes your grade subjective, secondly, since the number of mandatory required reviews for each student is fixed at 5 (and is not adjusted with the number of students), it is highly unlikely that all submissions will be reviewed or graded.",LgWwihnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.577319587629

However, if I had been a beginner in any of these topics, I'm not sure if this course would have been enough. Not much time is spent on clarifying HTML and CSS, i.e., there were a lot of topics untouched.

If an auto-grader or a way to ensure that everybody who turns in assignments will get those assignments graded back quickly could be implemented this would be a stellar class.

9866,"This course helped expand on my JavaScript knowledge, particularly concerning DOM structure. However, if I had been a beginner in any of these topics, I'm not sure if this course would have been enough. Not much time is spent on clarifying HTML and CSS, i.e., there were a lot of topics untouched. Additionally, while the instructor's videos were excellent, the professor did not participate in course discussions at all. I think there were many times when he should have been available to lend a helping/clarifying hand.",LgWwihnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.556603773585
