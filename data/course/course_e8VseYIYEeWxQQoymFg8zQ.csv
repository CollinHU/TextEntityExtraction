541,"Relatively decent video lectures, if not that blurry which makes text hard to read. Accompanied with awful practice lessons: - code templates are written with little to no style, even file reading is done in 3 different ways in all 3 lessons; - grader output is very confusing and almost useless; - unit tests, very useful to avoid some common caveats, were present in the first lesson, disappear completely in the last one.Probably following spark's programming guide is better time investment, even if it misses some humanity of video lectures ",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.586538461538

554,"The selection of content is very good. Yet, the course requires solid amount of polishing. I had a feeling that the real teaching started only in the 4th week, with lots of walking around the subject in the beginning. Worth to mention that in contrast to the first 3 courses in Scala specialisation this one is very heavy on visual aspect. You actually have to see the picture, as the voice channel just references it.I can certainly recommend this course to people curious about data analysis. If you have had some experience and would like to try Spark or get better at it, then probably a good book can save your time. ",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.604838709677

556,Would be better to have more and shorter exercises.,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.8
557,This course is a great introduction to Spark. The only thing I think could be improved is that each programming assignments has unit tests that drive students towards the final solution. I saw lots of people complaining in the forums about this slow and tedious back and forth of having the grader testing their code.,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.637931034483

566,Generally a really good introduction to Spark. What I found disturbing though were the very imbalanced difficulties of the excercises and the rather uninformative test messages that did not help for the implementation. There was no course where I had to search for other peoples suggestions in the forums. Still the course was good -- I would do it again!,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.609375

569,"I don't know what happened but it seems they had technical or some other problem while preparing this course. Some assignments were more oriented to solving marginal problems then using Spark and distributed and parallel computing. And that is really annoying.

607,"Very interesting course. Heather presents at just right level of abstraction to my taste and her presentation is very lively so it is easy to stay focused. Formally, this is a course on a particular set of software tools and many such courses are not very useful unless one is to start applying learned skills immdeiately because the material starts getting obsolete the day the course is passed. I believe that this course, however, teaches important priniples that outlive the particular toolkit, in particular the art of reasoning about algorithms on distributed collections, in particular, their performance. One would expect this to be a complex subject but somehow this course makes it feel simple -- which is a good indicator of high quality. ",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.522388059701

624,It's a great course with lots of insight into spark. At first it's confusing - first rdds; then dataframes and later datasets. But this is by no means the instructors' fault. Heather greatly describes in detail what goes on under the hood and why dataframes are way faster than simple rdds and why we have to give up some of our beloved typesafety of scala-land to let catalyst do its magic. Datasets try to bring some of it back. I really enjoyed coding the assignments. Took me ~2hrs each. The tasks were fun and like those you would find in the wild.I already applied some of the skills I learned here at work and successfully implemented a simple recommendation engine that will go to production next week.Highly recommend this course!,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.562913907285

As someone coming from more of a statistics background, I started this specialization only to learn Spark, so I wasn't always sure how relevant learning the more theoretical underpinnings of Scala would be.

I believe that this course, however, teaches important priniples that outlive the particular toolkit, in particular the art of reasoning about algorithms on distributed collections, in particular, their performance.

753,It's a great course with lots of insight into spark. At first it's confusing - first rdds; then dataframes and later datasets. But this is by no means the instructors' fault. Heather greatly describes in detail what goes on under the hood and why dataframes are way faster than simple rdds and why we have to give up some of our beloved typesafety of scala-land to let catalyst do its magic. Datasets try to bring some of it back. I really enjoyed coding the assignments. Took me ~2hrs each. The tasks were fun and like those you would find in the wild.I already applied some of the skills I learned here at work and successfully implemented a simple recommendation engine that will go to production next week.Highly recommend this course!,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.562913907285

768,"The course covers the important concepts and explains them in detail. Homework tasks really make you think, revisit the lectures and read documentation, until you get it right, and that all deepens understanding of the material.I also obtained some clues for the future: the lectures provided me with context, which helps formulate questions when searching for answers elsewhere.

771,"Lectures are great. Explanation are very clear. Assignment was having issue like incorrect and/or vague reporting which made them needlessly painfull. I'm quite sure that the next iteration of this course can get a 5 star rating, but for now, it's only 3.",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.709090909091

773,"I really enjoyed this course! First of all I would like to congratulate the people behind this effort. The videos are clear, to the point and they contain very useful information and tips that are very difficult to get from a book. I hope that you will continue with a second course on Spark and Scala with more advanced topics. Thank you very much.",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.614285714286
