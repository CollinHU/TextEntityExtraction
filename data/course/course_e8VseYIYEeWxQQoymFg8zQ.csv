544,"In the assignments, I had the feeling that the goal was more guess what they want than write it correctly using what you have learnt. Stating more clearly the requirements and improving error messages from the grader may help.",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.6666666666666666
545,"Relatively decent video lectures, if not that blurry which makes text hard to read. Accompanied with awful practice lessons - code templates are written with little to no style, even file reading is done in 3 different ways in all 3 lessons; - grader output is very confusing and almost useless; - unit tests, very useful to avoid some common caveats, were present in the first lesson, disappear completely in the last one.Probably following spark's programming guide is better time investment, even if it misses some humanity of video lectures ",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.5922330097087378

556,Great course - well prepared by the team.,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.7777777777777778
557,"Gives a really solid overview of the foundations of the Spark programming model, where it came from, and how latency affects this model for a distributed cluster. Explains well the key differenced between RDDs, Datasets, and Dataframes. Thought the videos were unnecessarily long and could do with sharpening them up a bit.",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.5423728813559322
558,"The selection of content is very good. Yet, the course requires solid amount of polishing. I had a feeling that the real teaching started only in the 4th week, with lots of walking around the subject in the beginning. Worth to mention that in contrast to the first 3 courses in Scala specialisation this one is very heavy on visual aspect. You actually have to see the picture, as the voice channel just references it.I can certainly recommend this course to people curious about data analysis. If you have had some experience and would like to try Spark or get better at it, then probably a good book can save your time. ",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.6048387096774194

560,Would be better to have more and shorter exercises.,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.8
561,This course is a great introduction to Spark. The only thing I think could be improved is that each programming assignments has unit tests that drive students towards the final solution. I saw lots of people complaining in the forums about this slow and tedious back and forth of having the grader testing their code.,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.6379310344827587

570,Generally a really good introduction to Spark. What I found disturbing though were the very imbalanced difficulties of the excercises and the rather uninformative test messages that did not help for the implementation. There was no course where I had to search for other peoples suggestions in the forums. Still the course was good -- I would do it again!,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.609375

574,"I don't know what happened but it seems they had technical or some other problem while preparing this course. Some assignments were more oriented to solving marginal problems then using Spark and distributed and parallel computing. And that is really annoying. Previous 3 courses were great, maybe this one will improve.",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.6206896551724138

588,"This is a great course on the intricacies of Apache Spark. It is not a general Big Data course, neither is it an easy one. Doing the programming assignments properly requires reading a lot trough the Spark documentation, which I personally liked as part of the challenge, but beware if you are not that type of person or aim at finishing the course as quickly as possible.",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.6164383561643836

612,"Very interesting course. Heather presents at just right level of abstraction to my taste and her presentation is very lively so it is easy to stay focused. Formally, this is a course on a particular set of software tools and many such courses are not very useful unless one is to start applying learned skills immdeiately because the material starts getting obsolete the day the course is passed. I believe that this course, however, teaches important priniples that outlive the particular toolkit, in particular the art of reasoning about algorithms on distributed collections, in particular, their performance. One would expect this to be a complex subject but somehow this course makes it feel simple -- which is a good indicator of high quality. ",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.5223880597014925

629,It's a great course with lots of insight into spark. At first it's confusing - first rdds; then dataframes and later datasets. But this is by no means the instructors' fault. Heather greatly describes in detail what goes on under the hood and why dataframes are way faster than simple rdds and why we have to give up some of our beloved typesafety of scala-land to let catalyst do its magic. Datasets try to bring some of it back. I really enjoyed coding the assignments. Took me ~2hrs each. The tasks were fun and like those you would find in the wild.I already applied some of the skills I learned here at work and successfully implemented a simple recommendation engine that will go to production next week.Highly recommend this course!,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.5629139072847682

641,"I learned so much from this course! It was amazing how Dr. Miller used concepts that were meticulously built up in the earlier courses, such as evaluation strategy, functional collections, reactive programming, and associativity, to describe the core of Spark in only four units. As someone coming from more of a statistics background, I started this specialization only to learn Spark, so I wasn't always sure how relevant learning the more theoretical underpinnings of Scala would be. It turns out that it was pretty essential, while also just making me a better programmer. Looking forward to the capstone!",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.5701754385964912

I believe that this course, however, teaches important priniples that outlive the particular toolkit, in particular the art of reasoning about algorithms on distributed collections, in particular, their performance.

759,It's a great course with lots of insight into spark. At first it's confusing - first rdds; then dataframes and later datasets. But this is by no means the instructors' fault. Heather greatly describes in detail what goes on under the hood and why dataframes are way faster than simple rdds and why we have to give up some of our beloved typesafety of scala-land to let catalyst do its magic. Datasets try to bring some of it back. I really enjoyed coding the assignments. Took me ~2hrs each.

770,"I learned so much from this course! It was amazing how Dr. Miller used concepts that were meticulously built up in the earlier courses, such as evaluation strategy, functional collections, reactive programming, and associativity, to describe the core of Spark in only four units. As someone coming from more of a statistics background, I started this specialization only to learn Spark, so I wasn't always sure how relevant learning the more theoretical underpinnings of Scala would be. It turns out that it was pretty essential, while also just making me a better programmer. Looking forward to the capstone!",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.5701754385964912
771,Challenging but very enlightening. Requires you to read the docs and figure out a lot of stuff on your own. My kind of course!,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.7407407407407407
772,Interesting and challenging course! Thank You!,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.625
773,"Some of the assignments are a bit challenging, due to grading system I suppose, but in the end general impression about this course is very positive",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.8214285714285714
774,"The course covers the important concepts and explains them in detail. Homework tasks really make you think, revisit the lectures and read documentation, until you get it right, and that all deepens understanding of the material.I also obtained some clues for the future the lectures provided me with context, which helps formulate questions when searching for answers elsewhere.

777,"Lectures are great. Explanation are very clear. Assignment was having issue like incorrect and or vague reporting which made them needlessly painfull. I'm quite sure that the next iteration of this course can get a 5 star rating, but for now, it's only 3.",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.7222222222222222
778,Great course. Very informative. I have learned a lot. Lessons are very well prepared and structured. Implementation tasks are interesting. Thanks to all EPFL team. Great job!,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.6176470588235294
779,"I really enjoyed this course! First of all I would like to congratulate the people behind this effort. The videos are clear, to the point and they contain very useful information and tips that are very difficult to get from a book. I hope that you will continue with a second course on Spark and Scala with more advanced topics. Thank you very much.",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.6142857142857143
