9965,Very nice course with introduction to Data analysis!,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.8888888888888888
9966,"I am disappointed because the course doesn't provide profound material on data analysis with python. The videos are too short and the samples demonstrated in the videos aren't thoroughly explained. For instance, the speaker often only says what she is doing but not WHY she is doing it or what the function of a particular parameter is. I felt left alone and forced to google. In my opinion it cannot be the purpose to make your student google basic things that could easily be integrated into the course.Considering that this is labelled as a beginner course I was expecting much more theoretical input. Other courses offer additional slides and scripts that are aligend with the course videos and allow the students to look things up.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5289855072463768

9972,Terrible. A waste of time and money. I recommend doing Statistics with R from Duke instead. This one should be taken off coursera.,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.8148148148148148
9973,"As an English speaking student, I felt this course was easy to follow and translated a complex subject into a step by step process of interpreting data. I like the hands-on development of a research question and learning the SAS and PYTHON Data Analytic software coding to extrapolate information from data sets. I didn't like the fact that it was difficult to get an instructor to respond in the forums and very difficult figuring out how to contact Coursera with any problems.

9979,"The course is great otherwise, however the certificate of this course just completed 'Data Management and Visualization' with no mention about the skills learnt or the grade attained. Primary reason I enrolled to the course was to list 'SAS' basic as a skill in my resume, however the certificate does not mention anything about SAS. If at least the certificate said completed 'Data Management and Visualization with SAS', it would be a good value for money. I strongly recommend Coursera should look into this. Thanks!",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5612244897959183
9980,Excellent...,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5
9981,This is a good course. I have done stats in the past so i was using this as a refresher but also to advance my python skills a bit more. I think you should take an introduction course to python first. you will get more out of the coding examples. I suggest the Intro to Python by the University of Toronto at Coursera. I found that to be an excellent course.I find that in these lectures they do a great job in explaining the stats theory. They do not dwell to much into the science behind it but more the applicability. This is all good. You can simply do a little additional research and get the pure science behind of it all,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5

9983,Very good summarization and introduction of data analysis process,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,1.0
9984,Course content good but a little too basic in my eyes. I think the addition of more functions in SAS Python would be useful. Having to do peer reviews is also not ideal.,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.75
9985,"A decent start for anyone interested in learning the basics. However, please make sure you add extra efforts from your end in understanding stats concepts if you are totally new to the subject as well as browsing things related to usage of SAS or python. The course touches only the basics so it is up the learner to explore and learn more about interested statistical tool.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.6857142857142857

9987,"A very beginner level course aimed at starters who dont have much experience with Data. Emphasis was on teaching Data Management with area of our interest. In Order to support this, assignments didnt had clear objective. I would have learnt a lot more through a course had they been more defined assignments.Not a course if you are looking to be ready for data related interviews. However, this course will be okay if you are working on some other field and want data management as an extra skillset.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.625

9996,"The professor and instructors don't understand how to properly write SAS programs and ignored constructive feedback. It's very sad to see students follow suit by producing hard to read codes, ignoring programming conventions. As an analytic leader in healthcare industry I am supervising some of my junior level team members to get some basic training , I want to say something to the students graduated from this course if you program the same way as being taught, you will lose a competitive advantage during job interview.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.6421052631578947
9997,"This course didn't talk too much about data management and visualization, which made me feel quite disappointed.

9998,"I'd pick 3.7 or so, really. The applied nature of the course is nice if you have a project in mind and to see the programming you learn in action. Without it, it might not be worth it because you could learn a lot of the SAS programming for free from SAS itself using their beginning programming coursework offered online in fact potential students may consider taking the SAS programming essentials course before taking this because you learn a lot about the SAS coding framework that comes in handy for this class .",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5247524752475248

In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code.

10039,"The course has its positives, but overall does not perform well instructing on the use of the two statistical software offered SAS &amp; Python . At the beginning they offer multiple data sets to use and formulate a research question, but all the examples utilize only one data set and do not cover the differences you might face with the other data sets - leading to a lot of missed opportunities.

Lectures do not provide enough information to complete the assignments. Zero interaction from course staff. Issues with getting assignments graded. In previous session the staff just refered you to the coursera helpdesk, but you cannot easily contact coursera directly. Main focus of course seems to be earning money and not educating.

10044,"The highest video production values of any class I've seen on Coursera so far. Unfortunately, that's the best part of the class; the support is simply nonexistent a post by someone associated with the staff from a previous run of the course suggests getting help troubleshooting Python from Coursera staff , the instructions for the class software are out of date, the source material for the assignments is sometimes unsuitable to the task you're asked to perform e.g. statistical analysis on a data set aggregated from disparate sources , and the pretty videos are at times completely unrelated to the actual assignments the very first week with the literature review . Dropping this specialization like a hot coal; it looked quite promising, but the aggravation over the poor organization and lack of support considerably outweighs anything I could get out of it.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5443037974683544

10084,"The instructions for submitting through Tumblr are not specific enough, especially after Week 1. ",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.625
10085,Terrible. A waste of time and money. I recommend doing Statistics with R from Duke instead. This one should be taken off coursera.,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.8148148148148148
10086,"As an English speaking student, I felt this course was easy to follow and translated a complex subject into a step by step process of interpreting data. I like the hands-on development of a research question and learning the SAS and PYTHON Data Analytic software coding to extrapolate information from data sets. I didn't like the fact that it was difficult to get an instructor to respond in the forums and very difficult figuring out how to contact Coursera with any problems.

10088,"Being the first ever course I took seriously with, it was fun and a new experience. Liked it. The way of teaching, the unique grading technique used by coursera, the tutors were perfect and to sum it up it was much more than I expected.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.6274509803921569
10089,Very helpful videos and clear explanations. Easy to follow up.,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.6666666666666666
10090,"The course is great otherwise, however the certificate of this course just completed 'Data Management and Visualization' with no mention about the skills learnt or the grade attained. Primary reason I enrolled to the course was to list 'SAS' basic as a skill in my resume, however the certificate does not mention anything about SAS. If at least the certificate said completed 'Data Management and Visualization with SAS', it would be a good value for money. I strongly recommend Coursera should look into this. Thanks!",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5612244897959183
10091,This is a good course. I have done stats in the past so i was using this as a refresher but also to advance my python skills a bit more. I think you should take an introduction course to python first. you will get more out of the coding examples. I suggest the Intro to Python by the University of Toronto at Coursera. I found that to be an excellent course.I find that in these lectures they do a great job in explaining the stats theory. They do not dwell to much into the science behind it but more the applicability. This is all good. You can simply do a little additional research and get the pure science behind of it all,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5
10092,perfect first touch with data management,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,1.0
10093,Course content good but a little too basic in my eyes. I think the addition of more functions in SAS Python would be useful. Having to do peer reviews is also not ideal.,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.75
10094,"A decent start for anyone interested in learning the basics. However, please make sure you add extra efforts from your end in understanding stats concepts if you are totally new to the subject as well as browsing things related to usage of SAS or python. The course touches only the basics so it is up the learner to explore and learn more about interested statistical tool.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.6857142857142857
10095,"A very beginner level course aimed at starters who dont have much experience with Data. Emphasis was on teaching Data Management with area of our interest. In Order to support this, assignments didnt had clear objective. I would have learnt a lot more through a course had they been more defined assignments.Not a course if you are looking to be ready for data related interviews. However, this course will be okay if you are working on some other field and want data management as an extra skillset.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.625
10096,My name is Jose Antonio from Brazil. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career https www.linkedin.com in joseantonio11 I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications.

10103,"The professor and instructors don't understand how to properly write SAS programs and ignored constructive feedback. It's very sad to see students follow suit by producing hard to read codes, ignoring programming conventions. As an analytic leader in healthcare industry I am supervising some of my junior level team members to get some basic training , I want to say something to the students graduated from this course if you program the same way as being taught, you will lose a competitive advantage during job interview.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.6421052631578947

10114,Choosing an actual research question allows you to find a topic of interest. This makes the content more meaningful and accelerates understanding of the concepts.,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.7037037037037037
10115,"There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions. In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code. This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before. ",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5619047619047619
10116,"It was good overall, some of the course materials were a bit sparse. You had to do your own research into getting packages working in spyder etc. I'd probably recommend that learners learn some python separately and read the docs for pandas.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.7083333333333334

10123,"The course has its positives, but overall does not perform well instructing on the use of the two statistical software offered SAS &amp; Python . At the beginning they offer multiple data sets to use and formulate a research question, but all the examples utilize only one data set and do not cover the differences you might face with the other data sets - leading to a lot of missed opportunities. Additionally, the tutorials for using the statistical software do not lend themselves towards a thorough understanding and more to a route learning.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.51
10124,"Very good introductory course on managing, subsetting, and manipulating data with SAS or Python.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5882352941176471
10125,"The highest video production values of any class I've seen on Coursera so far. Unfortunately, that's the best part of the class; the support is simply nonexistent a post by someone associated with the staff from a previous run of the course suggests getting help troubleshooting Python from Coursera staff , the instructions for the class software are out of date, the source material for the assignments is sometimes unsuitable to the task you're asked to perform e.g. statistical analysis on a data set aggregated from disparate sources , and the pretty videos are at times completely unrelated to the actual assignments the very first week with the literature review . Dropping this specialization like a hot coal; it looked quite promising, but the aggravation over the poor organization and lack of support considerably outweighs anything I could get out of it.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5443037974683544

10127,"The course is a very good introduction to Python for data exploration and management. That being said, it focuses too much on categorical data analysis, and I felt the transition to quantitative continuous data was not very well done.Moreover, some more explanations about several Python functions or coding choices could be better explained.But it's encouraging to see this type of statistical course for Python and not R!! Again!",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.6375

10129,The slides are excellent and instructions are clear and to the point. But that point is very limited. The main negative about this class is that there is absolutely no student TA teacher feedback and you're pretty much on your own learning. ,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.6808510638297872
10130,"I have never used SAS. I have done minimal statistics and my major in university was Sociology, which I did 20 years ago. So needless to say, I don't remember much.
