9916,Very nice course with introduction to Data analysis!,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.888888888889
9917,"I am disappointed because the course doesn't provide profound material on data analysis with python. The videos are too short and the samples demonstrated in the videos aren't thoroughly explained. For instance, the speaker often only says what she is doing but not WHY she is doing it or what the function of a particular parameter is. I felt left alone and forced to google. In my opinion it cannot be the purpose to make your student google basic things that could easily be integrated into the course.Considering that this is labelled as a beginner course I was expecting much more theoretical input. Other courses offer additional slides and scripts that are aligend with the course videos and allow the students to look things up.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.528985507246

9924,"As an English speaking student, I felt this course was easy to follow and translated a complex subject into a step by step process of interpreting data. I like the hands-on development of a research question and learning the SAS and PYTHON Data Analytic software coding to extrapolate information from data sets.

Primary reason I enrolled to the course was to list 'SAS' (basic) as a skill in my resume, however the certificate does not mention anything about SAS. If at least the certificate said completed 'Data Management and Visualization with SAS', it would be a good value for money. I strongly recommend Coursera should look into this.

9932,This is a good course. I have done stats in the past so i was using this as a refresher but also to advance my python skills a bit more. I think you should take an introduction course to python first. you will get more out of the coding examples. I suggest the Intro to Python by the University of Toronto at Coursera. I found that to be an excellent course.I find that in these lectures they do a great job in explaining the stats theory. They do not dwell to much into the science behind it but more the applicability. This is all good. You can simply do a little additional research and get the pure science behind of it all,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5

9936,"A decent start for anyone interested in learning the basics. However, please make sure you add extra efforts from your end in understanding stats concepts if you are totally new to the subject as well as browsing things related to usage of SAS or python.

9938,"A very beginner level course aimed at starters who dont have much experience with Data. Emphasis was on teaching Data Management with area of our interest. In Order to support this, assignments didnt had clear objective. I would have learnt a lot more through a course had they been more defined assignments.Not a course if you are looking to be ready for data related interviews.

9947,"The professor and instructors don't understand how to properly write SAS programs and ignored constructive feedback. It's very sad to see students follow suit by producing hard to read codes, ignoring programming conventions. As an analytic leader in healthcare industry (I am supervising some of my junior level team members to get some basic training), I want to say something to the students graduated from this course: if you program the same way as being taught, you will lose a competitive advantage during job interview.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.628865979381

Unfortunately, that's the best part of the class; the support is simply nonexistent (a post by someone associated with the staff from a previous run of the course suggests getting help troubleshooting Python from Coursera staff), the instructions for the class software are out of date, the source material for the assignments is sometimes unsuitable to the task you're asked to perform (e.g. statistical analysis on a data set aggregated from disparate sources), and the pretty videos are at times completely unrelated to the actual assignments (the very first week with the literature review).

I didn't like the fact that it was difficult to get an instructor to respond in the forums and very difficult figuring out how to contact Coursera with any problems.

10039,"Being the first ever course I took seriously with, it was fun and a new experience. Liked it. The way of teaching, the unique grading technique used by coursera, the tutors were perfect and to sum it up it was much more than I expected.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.627450980392
10040,Very helpful videos and clear explanations. Easy to follow up.,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.666666666667
10041,"The course is great otherwise, however the certificate of this course just completed 'Data Management and Visualization' with no mention about the skills learnt or the grade attained. Primary reason I enrolled to the course was to list 'SAS' (basic) as a skill in my resume, however the certificate does not mention anything about SAS. If at least the certificate said completed 'Data Management and Visualization with SAS', it would be a good value for money. I strongly recommend Coursera should look into this. Thanks!",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.55
10042,This is a good course. I have done stats in the past so i was using this as a refresher but also to advance my python skills a bit more. I think you should take an introduction course to python first. you will get more out of the coding examples. I suggest the Intro to Python by the University of Toronto at Coursera. I found that to be an excellent course.I find that in these lectures they do a great job in explaining the stats theory. They do not dwell to much into the science behind it but more the applicability. This is all good. You can simply do a little additional research and get the pure science behind of it all,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5
10043,perfect first touch with data management,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,1.0
10044,Course content good but a little too basic in my eyes. I think the addition of more functions in SAS/Python would be useful. Having to do peer reviews is also not ideal.,6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.72972972973
10045,"A decent start for anyone interested in learning the basics. However, please make sure you add extra efforts from your end in understanding stats concepts if you are totally new to the subject as well as browsing things related to usage of SAS or python. The course touches only the basics so it is up the learner to explore and learn more about interested statistical tool.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.685714285714
10046,"A very beginner level course aimed at starters who dont have much experience with Data. Emphasis was on teaching Data Management with area of our interest. In Order to support this, assignments didnt had clear objective. I would have learnt a lot more through a course had they been more defined assignments.Not a course if you are looking to be ready for data related interviews. However, this course will be okay if you are working on some other field and want data management as an extra skillset.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.625

It's very sad to see students follow suit by producing hard to read codes, ignoring programming conventions.

10066,"There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions. In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code. This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before. ",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.561904761905
10067,"It was good overall, some of the course materials were a bit sparse. You had to do your own research into getting packages working in spyder etc. I'd probably recommend that learners learn some python separately and read the docs for pandas.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.708333333333

10074,"The course has its positives, but overall does not perform well instructing on the use of the two statistical software offered (SAS &amp; Python). At the beginning they offer multiple data sets to use and formulate a research question, but all the examples utilize only one data set and do not cover the differences you might face with the other data sets - leading to a lot of missed opportunities. Additionally, the tutorials for using the statistical software do not lend themselves towards a thorough understanding and more to a route learning.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.50495049505

10076,"The highest video production values of any class I've seen on Coursera so far. Unfortunately, that's the best part of the class; the support is simply nonexistent (a post by someone associated with the staff from a previous run of the course suggests getting help troubleshooting Python from Coursera staff), the instructions for the class software are out of date, the source material for the assignments is sometimes unsuitable to the task you're asked to perform (e.g. statistical analysis on a data set aggregated from disparate sources), and the pretty videos are at times completely unrelated to the actual assignments (the very first week with the literature review). Dropping this specialization like a hot coal; it looked quite promising, but the aggravation over the poor organization and lack of support considerably outweighs anything I could get out of it.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.534161490683

10078,"The course is a very good introduction to Python for data exploration and management. That being said, it focuses too much on categorical data analysis, and I felt the transition to quantitative/continuous data was not very well done.Moreover, some more explanations about several Python functions or coding choices could be better explained.But it's encouraging to see this type of statistical course for Python and not R!!
