775,"I enjoyed a lot specially with the additional materials, giving insight to more in-depth concepts. I guess similar approach would help enrich the course if the course could also provide some basics of Scala so that we do not just copy and paste the commands. I am a programmer myself, but scripts like Scala have their own's very special culture that one has to adapt to it. It is not like Java or C++ which are easier to follow.

783,Very good project! Hopefully it will be helpful in my future career!,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.857142857143
784,"A good topic to continue building upon big data with Graphs, however Week 5 needs some more understandable examples and exercises. ",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.739130434783
785,This is one of the toughest and most interesting course at it deals with big data in graph database. Highly recommend this course to those who wants to know graph database.,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.666666666667
786,"Thanks to this program, I was able to obtain a job as a data scientist in a big data environment. I built a graphical database using neo4j, which no one else at my workplace had thought to do. I really appreciate the training I got through this specialization.",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.660377358491
787,Very poor explanation and very complicated topics.,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.625
788,Lower quality when compared to the previous courses in this specialization. Neo4j is very interesting but it is poorly explained. ,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.681818181818
789,"This course is supposed to be the most interesting, and most challenged one of this specialization. However i am quite disappointed with the instructor and the contents he put together. He speaks too fast without much clarity, and worst of all, i can tell most of the time he reads from the scripts without really conveying much knowledge about the contents.",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.567164179104
790,Greate Course,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.5

794,"I like the content at a high level, and I have a better appreciation for the value of graph analytics. That being said, I struggled with the GraphX hands on exersizes, where many of the Scala commands simply hung.",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.613636363636
795,"Very interesting class, large applications possibilities, unfortunately the hands on machine wont work properly ",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.6875
796,The concepts are brilliantly taught but the technical part that was programming was rushed through and not explained step by step. This is probably out of scope for this course but would have been good to get a little more technical training,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.767441860465
797,Thanks so much you are great people,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,1.0
798,"Really Thank you for all the big data course, just a little about the 5th course, Graph analytic, I think can must go to the deeper insight with more explanation, some of the modules was really vague!Thank you",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.659090909091

800,"Probably because I'm new to all the big data and graph analytics terminologies but the lectures in this chapter were quite difficult to follow in my opinion. The instructor was just talking, not teaching nor explaining, just like someone who prepares notes and is reading to students. The hand-ons were a bit helpful, but overall this class is more for those who already know about the subject. ",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.649350649351
801,"Concepts are explained in a rather structured way and hands-on with Neo4j are interesting.The last part with GraphX is pure copy-paste of orders, it is disappointing and not a good way to practive.",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.560975609756
802,"Very good material, very good Neo4j hands on for new comers. The critique goes to the coverage of GraphX hands on which, at least to me, is not explained clear enough",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.571428571429
803,I enjoyed this course and learned a great deal.,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.8
804,"This course was excellent as an introduction to Graph Analytics and using Neo4j. Not only did I learn a lot, I've been given tasks related to what I've learned in this course after finishing it.",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.642857142857
805,Another good and interesting course but the total lack of engagement by the course team and community mentors makes it hard going. ,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.739130434783
806,"The professor is well spoken and the class started out very well. But by the final section the hands on example were simply cut-paste with no explanation of what we were doing or how it worked. It's not the fault of the professor but this course and the Big Data specialization attempts to cover too much information. Graph Analytics should be its own 6 course specialization. But really, to understand graph analytics one should be spending a great deal of time with the subject. Perhaps online courses are not the way to understand such a complex subject.",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.583333333333
807,Wonderful course.,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.666666666667
808,"I was unhappy with this. It was clear that this course was pulled together from a superset of other material, and that it was not checked for consistency or completeness. The students were tested on their ability to write down a specific phrase from a video rather than on application of the principles learned from utilization of the graph database tools. (Broccoli -- REALLY???)Further, the lack of response to questions posted in the forum indicates a lack of engagement from instructors and / or facilitators.",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.521276595745

810,Excellent.,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.5
811,First week of 3 min video. Seriously we want to dive into the subject. And the last two weeks should have more content. Felt like much more copy and paste without understanding why you did that. Understand this should be introduction to Big Data... But the price you pay for the introduction is too expensive. ,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.72131147541

813,best course of the series,zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,1.0
814,"Maybe the best course of all the specialisation. Good balance between theory and hand-ons. I would give the fifth star with more details and explanations in some hand-ons (mainly the ones from the last lesson). In summary, a good introductory course to graph analysis.",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.592592592593
815,"The material on graph analytics was of introductory level. A string of interesting ideas, with unclear explanations. The lesson on GraphX was basically a copy-paste introduction to it's abilities without actually teaching how to use it. The transcripts are full of mistakes. Someone not proficient in English or hard of hearing would be confused by them. It was somewhat difficult to understand the main lecturer. The best part was the explanation of Neo4j - and it was at an introductory level. A disappointment.",zHCX4hJgEeaX4g6xdats6w,0.552083333333
816,"Great course. The reason I did not give it five stars because I thought the last week of the course was not up to par with the first 4 weeks.
