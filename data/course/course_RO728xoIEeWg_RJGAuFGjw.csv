2812,"I really liked this course and the way it was taught. Although I am a CS major, I really learnt a lot of other stuff from this course apart from learning the core content of Data Structures.",RO728xoIEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.625
2813,"Excellent course, packed full of information - A MUST for anyone who is learning the Java programming language. Lots of effort has gone into this course and is very well structured clearly defining topics week by week.",RO728xoIEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.65
2814,Amazing video lectures that help in understanding the concepts quickly. In video quizzes help make sure your thought process is right. But The assignments are way too simple if we follow all the steps provided. Assignments have to be more challenging. Surely 5 stars if they add more challenging assignments to this course.,RO728xoIEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.586206896552
2815,Great course! I have learned so much from testing design using JUnit on Eclipse to Algorithm big O evaluation. This course is really a delight especially due to the very cool project we built during the course.Thank you!,RO728xoIEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.767441860465

2822,One of the better programming classes. Definitely recommended. ,RO728xoIEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.6
2823,"Truly exceptional course for any beginner who wants to learn data structures from the basics. Everything is explained in detail. Loved learning things like asymptotic notations, calculating rate of growth of an algorithm. Also I liked the way the pseudo code is presented in the class made complex algorithms too easy. ",RO728xoIEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.625
2824,"Are you good at data structures ? If not, this will be the best course to start with. You learn the data structure and implement right away in your project assigment. Very practical.",RO728xoIEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.72972972973

2840,The data structures are basic in this course. But I loved working on the project. I had first hand experience on how to use Java to code these structures and I think this will help me a lot in the future. The course is well designed and I would recommend it to anybody who wants to learn Basic Data Structures with Java well.,RO728xoIEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.582089552239
