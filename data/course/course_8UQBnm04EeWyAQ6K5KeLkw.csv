10105,nice overview for java,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.75
10106,It provides me with exercises to practice but some of the videos explain things awfully or just not at all. Others are good. The discussion boards are helpful. I just wish they didn't talk as much about what something is as opposed to how it works. Many videos often don't show any code or very little which makes understand syntax difficult. ,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.657142857143

10158," This course wasn't well suited to me, being a person with a programming background. It was too introductory. But that doesn't say anything against the course.

10159,"It's a good course, but you do need programming experience. Also, takes twice as much time as they say, at least.

10163,"First time I gave 1 star. Reason, lecturers are terrible. This deserves a report, if there was adequate reporting system on Coursera. I had a feeling like I was watching professors from school for disabled, and not an university. . . Course material is actually decent, but extremely badly presented.

10165,"It is told that to take this course, basic computer skills like sending emails and downloading files are necessary-this is a beginning level course. Then, in the first module, instructors talk about polymorphism, inheritance and abstraction. For someone who have no prior programming experience, these are definitely not suitable topics to start with. Moreover, students are supposed to learn these concepts to get a good grade from first quiz, although they know nothing about programming.I had some programming experience, so I was already familiar with these subjects. But the lectures were too boring to keep watching. I watched like 10 videos and learned nothing about the course subject. I think I won't be spending my time for this course, which seems to me like reading some reference files.",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.533333333333

10167,"Basing on the first videos, I would not recommend this course to anyone believing that You are expected have basic computer literacy skills, such as knowing how to send &amp; receive emails and browse the web. The lector is robotic, the slides look outdated, listener is bored after 10 min of watching. I definitely WOULD NOT pay for this course.

10170,"I wouldn't recommend this to student who has never programmed in any computer language before. A bright, aggressive, student could learn this material with help of online examples, etc. The basic language features, etc, are pretty straight forward, but the object oriented features are probably too advanced for someone 3 weeks into programming. As an experienced programmer in other languages (C++ / Python / Perl) I found it was about the right pace to do in addition to my real job, and am looking forward to the rest of the series coming online.",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.550458715596

10233,Should just be called 'Introduction of Java for absolute beginners'. I don't recall anything '...for Android' about the coding.Some of the lecturers are so bad at speaking that it's painful to listen to. I really expected better.,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.591836734694
10234,"Recommend this course for people with some coding background. For those never code before, going through this course in 4 weeks can be a very challenging journey. ",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.666666666667
10235,great course,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,1.0
10236,"Well done, well explained, good assignments, looking forward to take the second.",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.5625
10237,I feel I have really solidified my understanding of Java basics for the purposes of learning the Android development platform,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.65
10238,Grate Course content and very well explained.,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.75
10239,This is a good course but there's some flaws (not about knowledge),8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.75
10240,"The assignments are challenging and well balanced. The extra provided code adds a good opportunity to see how professional programmers code and the course videos explain all the content clearly and in an organized fashion. Overall, the course is made easy through the videos and the assignments do well to compel good and continuous practice. ",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.559322033898
10241,"Very very bad communication from the teachers. The 2nd MOOC was supposed to start I think 2.5 months ago, it did not start at the time of this review. They did not even bother to post some announcement to let the students know : ok course starts in x months.Making things worse, you cannot get a refund if you purchased the entire thing.",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.569444444444
10242,very interesting course for beginners and wannabe app developers ,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.555555555556
10243," This course wasn't well suited to me, being a person with a programming background. It was too introductory. But that doesn't say anything against the course. The reason I don't rate the course highly is that it just wasn't that coherent. I would have preferred to have a single, consistently good instructor. ",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.537313432836
10244,"It's a good course, but you do need programming experience. Also, takes twice as much time as they say, at least. Also, third week of course has a lot of work, while fourth week has very little. Would be nice to balance them out. I did get a lot out of the course and plan to continue with this specialization.",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.625
10245,"Awesome content, all the requiered foundations for the real beginning in the Android world.",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.625
10246,Course was really good.If someone is not having any coding experience then also he can learn with the help of these courses.,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.8
10247,"I loved this intro to Android. It was a great refresher on Java and gave a peek into the Android framework that is intimidating, but makes me want to learn more!",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.676470588235
10248, Very Helpful ,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,1.0
10249,Excellent Course. ,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.666666666667
10250,"I wouldn't recommend this to student who has never programmed in any computer language before. A bright, aggressive, student could learn this material with help of online examples, etc. The basic language features, etc, are pretty straight forward, but the object oriented features are probably too advanced for someone 3 weeks into programming. As an experienced programmer in other languages (C++ / Python / Perl) I found it was about the right pace to do in addition to my real job, and am looking forward to the rest of the series coming online.",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.550458715596
10251,Excellent Course!,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.666666666667
10252,Content was good. But organization could have been better. Assignments and auto-grader had issues and the problem statements were modified during the course. ,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.642857142857
10253,"Good course. First time enrolled course in Coursera. I really enjoyed it. Lots of quiz and weekly assignment kept me busy for 4 weeks. And because of these ( assignment due date), i really learned by forcing myself to complete all in time. Quite tough on week 3, and i watched the videos multiple times and google the subject in order to understand the contents. Take this course, and struggle for 4 weeks. Will not regret. ",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.551724137931
10254,Java for Android was everything I expected. The lectures and assignments were very clear. The instructors and mentors were very helpful. I am looking forward to the next class.,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.515151515152
10255,Very nice course for beginners,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.8
10256,"A good introduction to java programming, the mentor team was really helpful and interactive and it was a pleasure to interact with them!Unfortunately, it is clear that this course still needs to be polished: some assignments contained mistakes or where even bugged. Mistakes and bugs have been fixed when they were reported but it still left an amateur aftertaste (especially considering that we had to wait for a few weeks for this course).",8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.604938271605
10257,Nice preparation to Java.,8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,0.6
