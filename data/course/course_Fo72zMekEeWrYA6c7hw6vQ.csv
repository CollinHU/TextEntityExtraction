5657,Great course in NLP which provides a broad overview of the topic. The programming assignments can make you confident in solving NLP-based problems in business applications.,Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.533333333333
5658,Its a tough course but worth it!More in depth details will be much better.Coding Assignments can be explained much better. In this course there is problem in understanding coding assignment details as in some cases they are not explained correctly.,Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.586956521739
5659,"I got very good introduction not only for NLP but also for other adjacent topics like ML, probability theory, linear algebra. Highly recommend if you want to get involved in these topics.",Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.75
5660,An ambitious sweep across the NLP landscape. Requires at least intermediate knowledge of Python; especially the programming assignments are barely doable without advanced debugging skills. Exercises often refer to material not covered in the course up to that point.,Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.674418604651
5661,"Although the course seems to be very interesting and cover wide spectrum of NLP subjects, it is full with references to other materials some of them are no longer exist in the location given. Also the programming exercises quite often are detached from the material and also have references to materials that were not covered in lectures accompany them.My advice to author - made lectures and exercises more self-contained. Do not try to cover enormous amount of material during one week. Make exercised to be closely connected to the material given during that week.",Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.52427184466
5662,"After about week 6, helpfulness decreased quite a lot..",Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.636363636364
5663,"Great overview of many of the most important topics of NLP. Practical examples and exploration of different approaches for each task (from first attempts to state of the art) make it easier to understand and absorb the theoretical content, while acquiring insight for concrete applications.

5664,The course skims through loads of topics .Need to go deep in some of them.,Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.647058823529
5665,Recommended for new users who want to learn NLP.,Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.6
5666,"A lot of good information, but I found it hard to retain most of it without a less dry style of presentation. Assignment were quite hard, and instructions were a bit too sketchy.",Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.675675675676
5667,"It's more towards teaching linguistics and theoretical concepts. I understand that is also required to understand the subject. However, I was expecting more practical training on coding different programs with various ways. I suggest to introduce a balance in theory concepts and practical training.",Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.607843137255
5668,"I don't have the impression that much effort was invested in this class to present natural language processing as introductory as possible for beginners in this field, i.e. someone who not necessarily has a background in computational linguistics. ",Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.688888888889
5669,"The assignments were not well supported by the lecture material, which were much to shallow. I guess an Intro level course is going to be broad and shallow, but if you are going to have assignments that require implementation then that should be better supported by the material. And don't even get me started on the final...",Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.609375
5670,"Excellent introductory course. The programming exercises were all interesting and helpful, actually, I think the course could include more programming exercises and video quizzes.",Fo72zMekEeWrYA6c7hw6vQ,0.571428571429
