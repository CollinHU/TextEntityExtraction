3312,"This course provides a great foundation to build upon, but it is not very engaging. The instructor is simply reading off the screen and it looks like all the lectures were recorded over one day. He struggles to read the material towards the end of the course, while often mispronouncing the words and neglecting the concept of punctuation. I would recommend reading the reference book used in this course, Cybersecurity and Cyberwar What Everyone Needs to Know, because listening to the lectures is painful!",8TKORJrSEeW6bw4ogk2HGQ,0.5543478260869565
