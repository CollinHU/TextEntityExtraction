7440,loved it - fascinating subject and more detail than you could possibly want from the course instructors. Friendly community in the forum too.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.76
7441,"By far the laziest course set up in the track. It's an interesting topic, but without independent study I would have learned almost nothing due to the lack of any practicals in this Practical Machine Learning. A really disappointing course that fails to be worth more than just a couple hours of youtube.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.71186440678
7442,Some of the content are not designed in a way easy to digest especially for a novice people doesn't have a lot of background like me. I have to use google and read out of the lecture excessively to understand some of the points that were jumped or not mentioned in the lecture. Maybe they are self-evident to people in the domain of machine learning but they were hard for me. I wish the lecture could have explained them in more detail in a plainer way. ,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.521276595745

7445,Great Course!,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.666666666667
7446,Very fine course in machine learning where the focus is more on the use of ML rather on the theory behind it i.e. the course title fits its contents.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.69696969697
7447,"This course really demystified machine learning, and provided practical steps and guidance on how to create predictive models. While I do wish there were more resources on how to tune models and investigate specific model parameters, I understand that there just wasn't enough time. I couldn't imagine a better course for a solid foundation in this skill.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.590909090909
7448,Good,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,1.0
7449,Good in introducing caret package and getting some experience in running algorithms. Was expecting more in-depth discussion about the methods though.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.64

7451,"I learned so much in such a short period of time. Challenging, very hands on, great theoretical foundations! ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.681818181818
7452,This was definitely a challenging course. I learned a lot about building and testing prediction algorithms. The course also helped me overcome the feeling of intimidation by providing excellent examples and a hands-on final assignment.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.65
7453,Great as an introduction for someone with no practical experience. Lectures are too theoretical and lack some examples to translates the theory into practice,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.84
7454,Good,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,1.0

7459,"This is such a cornerstone topic to the Data Science Specialization that I think it deserves a better designed and more polished curriculum. The subject is so extensive that it might be worthy to split the contents in two courses. Finally, I would like to suggest the authors of the course modeling the curriculum following the amazing treatment of the subject found in Introduction to Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshiriani et. al.

7460,Really hands-on compact introduction!,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.571428571429
7461,Jeff Leek is a great professor .The delivery of the course material is very clear and covers a lot of predictive methods by using mainly R's caret package. Recommended for sure. ,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.666666666667
7462,"This course was a big let-down compared to other courses in the specialization. It doesn't seem like a lot of effort went into course planning and creation. Much of the content is unclear and there is little depth. course textbook, and some swirl exercises would have helped.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.625
7463,Very good summary of strengths/weaknesses of various machine learning algorithms. This lecturer's style and production quality is much higher than in the previous two courses in the specialization series.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.685714285714

7465,"Good course on the whole, learned a lot and enjoyed it, but it would need to be updated and corrected (certain bits of code don't work as they did when the course was produced, which can be pretty confusing). Would be nice also to add some more content at the end of the course : the lecture about unsupervised prediction felt rushed, and a proper conclusion opening up to the rest of the field would be useful. Anyway thanks again for this wonderful learning opportunity, keep it up ! Cheers",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.61
7466,This course is a good introduction to machine learning algorithms with R,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.916666666667
7467,"very good, but if it has swirl practice like th other courses it would be perfect.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.722222222222
7468,"So why four stars vs five stars, of all the Data Science Certification courses that I have taken: i) some of the examples and quiz challenges don't work as they should, ii) Machine Learning is rapidly changing area - should be updated to reflect this and perhaps a high level taste of Deep Learning, iii) posting the Final Project is overly complicated relative to methods of the other courses - this should be cleaned up - still not clear how point to a github repo link and also have a rendered html page working from that same link - requires two links to present materials and must use default names like index vs. a project name.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.51968503937
7469,"Very shallow content - broad, but not deep. Not many assignments instead of the last one. We hear what we heard before. For the same price, Analytics Edge at EdX is far better choice for practical machine learning.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.681818181818
7470,excellent!,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.5
7471,Very useful course to develop level knowledge in machine learning. ,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.909090909091
7472,Very good course. The content can be enriched with some more technical details behind the various techniques. There needs to be 1 more course on Practical Machine Learning in the specialization as 1 course is far too less for such a vast topic.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.695652173913
7473,"Nice, clear and concise.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.666666666667
7474,Instructor rushes the course and does not explain much in the same level of details as respective quiz requires,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.789473684211
7475,"Issues of every stage of the construction of learning machine model, as well as issues with several different machine learning methods are well and in fine yet very understandable detail explained.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.636363636364
7476,"While the overview of the content seemed very reasonable both in scope and pacing, the lack of swirl exercises meant that the final project for the course was a bit jostling. Overall, I think this course still needs some development in the way of exercises to familiarize the student with the practical exercises associated with machine learning.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.639344262295
7477,"mentorship was great, but the video lectures were almost useless.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.75
7478,Great course! The hands-on approach make it very useful for one to start doing some very interesting analysis in real life! Thanks a lot! You guys could only make some efforts in updating some classes and packages used in quizzes. But the rest was great!,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.615384615385
7479,I like initial courses like Exploratory Data Analysis but later on it got harder to follow the lectures. A lot of topics were just rushed through and little effort was made to make them engaging or interesting. ,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.820512820513
7480,"Really enlightening! It has short videos that fully explicate and explain the concepts and also give you code you can use! The code actually works! I would prefer that the instructor get a proper microphone so his voice sounds not so harsh, but this can be forgiven, because the content really is awesome!You can also download all the lectures (and there are transcripts, too), which is great for later reference. Try it - you will like it!",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.561797752809

7484,PML is a deep subject and this course is an excellent foundation for further studies. Prof Leek has taught brilliantly on the basic concepts of PML given the short time of 4 weeks. You need college level statistics to fully appreciate the theories of the PML's lectures. ,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.615384615385

7488,"By using the caret package, this course took a very pragmatic approach towards machine learning. It demonstrated how to perform all the essential tasks in making the machine (algorithm) learn from data. In my case, this course required a dedicated time commitment for successful completion.

7506,"As the title states, very practical way to show you how this is done in R. Most of them are lines of codes and some explanation. There are tons of details behind that and remains un-explained.

7521,"Gosh I hated hated hated this course. Nothing to learn here. You will just be given lots of names with no explanation whatsoever.I often felt really angry at the teacher because of the way he would introduce entire prediction models without explaining anything about them. Also, I really didn't like the fact that the course is centered on caret, a shortcut package to do stuff fast. Before doing things fast I need to know what I am doing!

7576,"As as standalone course on machine learning, it's probably best to take Andrew Ng's class on Coursera. This course mostly teaches the basic usage of the caret package. It is too short to cover more fundamental topics in machine learning, like how to choose an algorithm based on the problem and the data.I took this class just because I was engaged in the Data Science specialization. I wanted to clear the Capstone project and get the Data Science specialization certificate.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.532608695652
7577,"I saw two main issues with this course: 1) dated lecture videos, oftentimes with R code that can't be replicated using up-to-date packages, and 2) lack of thoughtful design: example after example after example after example doesn't really teach you anything. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.535714285714
7578,Felt difficult in understanding the overall course in short duration . 1 month is not enough for this course. I request the authors to make the course much more simpler,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.709677419355

7581,Nice course.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.666666666667
7582,In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion (such as regression models and stat. inference). The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms. Also I think it's a bit out of date because there is no references to xgbboost which is now dominating many Kaggle contests,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.547945205479
7583,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6
7584,This is a very useful course in Machine Learning that teaches us how to use the R based packages such as CARET for applying machine learning techniques. The course project helps understand how these techniques are applied in real world applications and develop useful insights. ,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.63829787234
7585,Course content feels upside down. You'll learn about machine algorithm specifics and caveats before anyone explains what the said algorithm actually hopes to achieve.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.642857142857
7586,"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.569620253165
7587,"The lectures were great and engaging. I felt like they went too fast. Jeff says at the beginning that this is just an overview and points to some other resources.

Also I saw the organization of folders and lecture notes and everything in Github repo for this course. It s awesome. I keep stuff like that.. well numbered and everything. I really appreciate it as it makes life of a student lot easier. Thanks.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.53164556962

7600,"Useful course that is very practical in teaching tools in R that enable Machine learning. This course is, however, not suitable for people who want to learn theoretical machine learning.

7606,The mathematics in this course are at a high level (similar to Statistical Inference) - and are presented at a pace that is challenging without significant background in the field. There is little guidance presented on the methods required. It is recommended that students source out plenty of support material (intro to statistical inference and similar).,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.532258064516

7610,"Absolutely useless random un-explained list of facts and advices that is thrown to a learner without any attempt to give a systematic approach. Pure waste of time and effort. Can only be suitable to those, who already know the subject well and can use some additional facts that are randomly presented in this course.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.7
7611,Very practical tools and also very encouraging!! ,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.625
7612,The instructions for the final project were very unclear and even though I submitted all assignments well before their respective deadlines and reviewed the required number of projects my work was not processed for a grade thereby delaying my specialization completion.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.666666666667
7613,Compared to previous two courses in specialization this one is far worse - it is more of excursion into used methods than actual learning using any of mentioned methods in enough detail to be able to do meaningful analyses.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.675

7630,"Project description versus requirements were terrible, not sure if the new Coursera format played a role in the issues or not. Quite a few of the homework items require guessing as the answers don't align to the results of the latest tools they have you use.

7632,"The course gives a clear explanation of why machine learning, with a goal of prediction, is different from regression. The use of the caret package in R is emphasized.

7637,"I'm somewhat disappointed. I attend almost all other courses in this specialization (except of data product) and this one is, on my opinion, the weakest one. A lot of links to useful information though. This is more reference guide rather than a real training course. I can say even more, initially I start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one. For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better. In lectures on some concepts (like regularization) I'm pretty sure I would not understand anything if I had not been familiar with the subject before.. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.516129032258

7642,"Does not give much intuition around the subject. I found the lectures a bit uninspiring. Lots of powerpoint (just text, no images or visuals really) and the lecturer just underlined the words he was talking about as he read the powerpoint out.

7684,PML is a deep subject and this course is an excellent foundation for further studies. Prof Leek has taught brilliantly on the basic concepts of PML given the short time of 4 weeks. You need college level statistics to fully appreciate the theories of the PML's lectures. ,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.615384615385

7687,"By using the caret package, this course took a very pragmatic approach towards machine learning. It demonstrated how to perform all the essential tasks in making the machine (algorithm) learn from data. In my case, this course required a dedicated time commitment for successful completion. In addition to course lectures, i used the 'Machine Learning with R' book to fill my knowledge gaps. Overall i feels that this course helped me in my journey of gaining a better understanding of this subject.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.531914893617

7699,The quiz should be constructed in a way that depends less on the version of the libraries used. The rest of course was excellent.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.653846153846
7700,"Awesome course. Jeff Leek does a truly amazing job at explaining very complicated concepts thoroughly and quickly. I'm surprised we went through as much material as we did. Out of the 9, this is one my favorites.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.727272727273
7701,"As the title states, very practical way to show you how this is done in R. Most of them are lines of codes and some explanation. There are tons of details behind that and remains un-explained. As other courses in the specialization, students need to do a lot of self-study to further understand machine learning. But at least, learned a lot. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.58904109589
7702,My name is Jose Antonio. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11) I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications.

7703,"The topic is too big, for one course from my point of view.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.866666666667
7704,"good course, but one who is serious about data science should view this course as a starting point since machine learning is a semester long course so I'd recommend follow up with machine learning course taught from Andrew Ng out of Stanford",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.733333333333

7706,"Great intro to machine learning. Several algorithms with some ideas on sampling and pre-processing techniques are covered. Adding a textbook as done with some of the other data science classes would help, but other resources are referenced.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.581395348837
7707,Awesome,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,1.0
7708,Great course. Only missing piece is the working information / maths behind the models. But as the name suggests it teaches practical approach towards machine learning.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.655172413793
7709,"It very well done, good pace, and gives you real and concrete elements and examples to build a fully functional machine learning algorithm! i recommend this course",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.733333333333
7710,"Although again very interesting, I found the lack of additional materials such as practical exercises, swirls and a book reduced the depth of the course knowledge for me. Maybe we have been spoiled by the previous courses :-)",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.707317073171

7714,Wonderful!,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.5
7715,"Gosh I hated hated hated this course. Nothing to learn here. You will just be given lots of names with no explanation whatsoever.I often felt really angry at the teacher because of the way he would introduce entire prediction models without explaining anything about them. Also, I really didn't like the fact that the course is centered on caret, a shortcut package to do stuff fast. Before doing things fast I need to know what I am doing! Finally, the quizzes and assignments are completely disconnected from the courses.The worst course I have ever taken on coursera.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.607142857143
7716,It's a great course but I hope you add a few things. The course about the machine learning algorithm is so basic. Please get deep into the machine learning algorithm. Then it would become the perfect course.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.627906976744

7722,Lectures are too complicated. I understand that material is not easy and one should do a lot of research and reading to understand the essence of the taught algorithms but the lecturer is also not very helpful and assignments are everywhere on the internet which nobody needs to get tired of thinking a little to do the homework as their product.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.650793650794

7730,"It's very cookbook driven - it's not a deep dive into the topics. This can be dangerous: a little knowledge and all that. However references for more are provided. If you can imitate the coding examples, you should be OK for the assignments. Fair warning: the quizzes are hard to replicate unless you set up your environment to mirror exactly the version of the packages used in the course. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.567901234568
7731,"Very enjoyable and generally quite understandable introduction to machine learnings with hands-on approach through the course project.

7751,Nice course.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.666666666667
7752,In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion (such as regression models and stat. inference). The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms. Also I think it's a bit out of date because there is no references to xgbboost which is now dominating many Kaggle contests,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.547945205479
7753,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6
7754,This is a very useful course in Machine Learning that teaches us how to use the R based packages such as CARET for applying machine learning techniques. The course project helps understand how these techniques are applied in real world applications and develop useful insights. ,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.63829787234
7755,Course content feels upside down. You'll learn about machine algorithm specifics and caveats before anyone explains what the said algorithm actually hopes to achieve.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.642857142857
7756,"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.569620253165

7767,The mathematics in this course are at a high level (similar to Statistical Inference) - and are presented at a pace that is challenging without significant background in the field. There is little guidance presented on the methods required. It is recommended that students source out plenty of support material (intro to statistical inference and similar).,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.532258064516

A lot of links to useful information though. This is more reference guide rather than a real training course. I can say even more, initially I start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one. For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better. In lectures on some concepts (like regularization) I'm pretty sure I would not understand anything if I had not been familiar with the subject before.. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.516129032258
