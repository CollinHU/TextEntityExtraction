7484,loved it - fascinating subject and more detail than you could possibly want from the course instructors. Friendly community in the forum too.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.76
7485,"By far the laziest course set up in the track. It's an interesting topic, but without independent study I would have learned almost nothing due to the lack of any practicals in this Practical Machine Learning. A really disappointing course that fails to be worth more than just a couple hours of youtube.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.7118644067796609
7486,Some of the content are not designed in a way easy to digest especially for a novice people doesn't have a lot of background like me. I have to use google and read out of the lecture excessively to understand some of the points that were jumped or not mentioned in the lecture. Maybe they are self-evident to people in the domain of machine learning but they were hard for me. I wish the lecture could have explained them in more detail in a plainer way. ,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.5212765957446809

7490,Very fine course in machine learning where the focus is more on the use of ML rather on the theory behind it i.e. the course title fits its contents.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.696969696969697
7491,"This course really demystified machine learning, and provided practical steps and guidance on how to create predictive models. While I do wish there were more resources on how to tune models and investigate specific model parameters, I understand that there just wasn't enough time. I couldn't imagine a better course for a solid foundation in this skill.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.5909090909090909
7492,Good,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,1.0

7503,"This is such a cornerstone topic to the Data Science Specialization that I think it deserves a better designed and more polished curriculum. The subject is so extensive that it might be worthy to split the contents in two courses. Finally, I would like to suggest the authors of the course modeling the curriculum following the amazing treatment of the subject found in Introduction to Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshiriani et. al.

7509,"Good course on the whole, learned a lot and enjoyed it, but it would need to be updated and corrected certain bits of code don't work as they did when the course was produced, which can be pretty confusing . Would be nice also to add some more content at the end of the course the lecture about unsupervised prediction felt rushed, and a proper conclusion opening up to the rest of the field would be useful.

7524,"Really enlightening! It has short videos that fully explicate and explain the concepts and also give you code you can use! The code actually works! I would prefer that the instructor get a proper microphone so his voice sounds not so harsh, but this can be forgiven, because the content really is awesome!You can also download all the lectures and there are transcripts, too , which is great for later reference.

You will just be given lots of names with no explanation whatsoever.I often felt really angry at the teacher because of the way he would introduce entire prediction models without explaining anything about them. Also, I really didn't like the fact that the course is centered on caret, a shortcut package to do stuff fast. Before doing things fast I need to know what I am doing!

7620,"As as standalone course on machine learning, it's probably best to take Andrew Ng's class on Coursera. This course mostly teaches the basic usage of the caret package. It is too short to cover more fundamental topics in machine learning, like how to choose an algorithm based on the problem and the data.I took this class just because I was engaged in the Data Science specialization. I wanted to clear the Capstone project and get the Data Science specialization certificate.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.532608695652174
7621,"I saw two main issues with this course 1 dated lecture videos, oftentimes with R code that can't be replicated using up-to-date packages, and 2 lack of thoughtful design example after example after example after example doesn't really teach you anything. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.5769230769230769
7622,Felt difficult in understanding the overall course in short duration 1 month is not enough for this course. I request the authors to make the course much more simpler,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.7333333333333333

7625,Nice course.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6666666666666666
7626,In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion such as regression models and stat. inference . The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms. Also I think it's a bit out of date because there is no references to xgbboost which is now dominating many Kaggle contests,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.5555555555555556
7627,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6
7628,This is a very useful course in Machine Learning that teaches us how to use the R based packages such as CARET for applying machine learning techniques. The course project helps understand how these techniques are applied in real world applications and develop useful insights. ,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6382978723404256
7629,Course content feels upside down. You'll learn about machine algorithm specifics and caveats before anyone explains what the said algorithm actually hopes to achieve.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6428571428571429
7630,"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.569620253164557
7631,"The lectures were great and engaging. I felt like they went too fast. Jeff says at the beginning that this is just an overview and points to some other resources. As an overview, this class works well. You can expect to learn a bit about what machine learning is and how to to do it using the caret package in R.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6716417910447762

Also I saw the organization of folders and lecture notes and everything in Github repo for this course. It s awesome. I keep stuff like that.. well numbered and everything. I really appreciate it as it makes life of a student lot easier. Thanks.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.5316455696202531

7644,"Useful course that is very practical in teaching tools in R that enable Machine learning. This course is, however, not suitable for people who want to learn theoretical machine learning.

7650,The mathematics in this course are at a high level similar to Statistical Inference - and are presented at a pace that is challenging without significant background in the field. There is little guidance presented on the methods required. It is recommended that students source out plenty of support material intro to statistical inference and similar .,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.559322033898305

7667,Really good class. I think there were some small issues with the class project. Like all real world problems it was not entirely well specified and the data was a bit odd to use for a prediction exercise because it was time series data.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.7234042553191491

7675,This is too high level for a machine learning course. You don't exactly learn a lot about the techniques just how to use them and name them out if you're having a conversation with a person. My least favorite course in the series,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.7346938775510204
7676,"The course gives a clear explanation of why machine learning, with a goal of prediction, is different from regression. The use of the caret package in R is emphasized.

7681,"I'm somewhat disappointed. I attend almost all other courses in this specialization except of data product and this one is, on my opinion, the weakest one. A lot of links to useful information though. This is more reference guide rather than a real training course. I can say even more, initially I start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one. For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better. In lectures on some concepts like regularization I'm pretty sure I would not understand anything if I had not been familiar with the subject before.. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.5298013245033113

You will just be given lots of names with no explanation whatsoever.I often felt really angry at the teacher because of the way he would introduce entire prediction models without explaining anything about them. Also, I really didn't like the fact that the course is centered on caret, a shortcut package to do stuff fast. Before doing things fast I need to know what I am doing!

7796,In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion such as regression models and stat. inference . The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms.
