6655,"Great overview of designed and organic data collection! I feel more confident interpreting and understanding survey results and providing input on community-based research projects. Some of the readings were challenging for me because I have not studied statistics, but it was a welcome challenge. I plan to return to some of the course materials after completing a stats 101 course. I took the survey questionnaire design course in this specialization two years ago and I wish I'd taken this first. If you're thinking of sampling courses from this specialization, I highly recommend you start here. ",xj2LNEUVEeWE9A7XSkBY3w,0.5779816513761468
6656,"This course is extremely hard to follow, not because of the content but because of the delivery. Presentation, visuals, word choice, speed, all very poor. I'm in week 3 and EVERY video has been just as difficult to follow. Quizzes are hard to understand and ask you about things that weren't of any actual value to the course, and or weren't even covered. Also, because multiple answers are required for each question, you are basically answering a 4 part question that is only worth 1 point. Get one part wrong and you miss the whole 1 point.
