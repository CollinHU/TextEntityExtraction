5639,Why there is no minus one star? Because one star is way to much for this course. Stay away!,gqC2SjelEeWnxw5wP_KHTw,0.7272727272727273
5640,"In this capstone project, you're given a framework to work with, and asked to create an app with pretty minimal required criteria. The problem is, there's very little instructions or support, so it feels like a classroom where the instructor said do whatever you want and walks out of the door. Overall the specialization feels ill-organized and of questionable quality, and there are plenty of negative sentiments in the forums.",gqC2SjelEeWnxw5wP_KHTw,0.5833333333333334
5641,"After the first week, the instructors never showed up to answer a single question in the forums. The capstone project itself was disappointing, I learned much more from doing my own app in class 3.I took the Coursera Android specialization, which was eons better than this. I would not recommend this iOS specialization to anyone. I would never again take a MOOC from U of Toronto.",gqC2SjelEeWnxw5wP_KHTw,0.5466666666666666
