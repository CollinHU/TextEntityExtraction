0,Good course. Learned a lot from it. Thanks!,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.727272727273
1,This course was great! With good code examples and algorithm applications and also intuition!It's a shame that we couldn't finish planned courses due to busy schedules of instructors as I was really looking forward to the capstone project! ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.673913043478
2,Nice course with all the practical stuffs and nice analysis about each topic but practical part of LDA was restricted for GraphLab users only which is a weak fallback and rest everything is fine.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.742857142857
3,Clustering &amp; Retrieval was a lot tougher compared to courses on regression &amp; classification because the match concepts behind this course were too complex. Nevertheless Emily tried to make this course as intuitive as possible,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6
4,I'm a grad student and I can notice the instructor makes a difference in this course. I fully recommend it.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.708333333333
5,awesome course!,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.666666666667

7,very good! strongly recommend to people who want to start a career on data science or are interested in it,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.904761904762
8,The teachers are really amazing. They do not just explain it as if they read a book. They explain the concepts very well,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.68
9,Overall is great. The LDA and Dendrograms lack quality/specificity and depth of the previous topics. So sad the Specialization collapsed at 4 courses instead of 6.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.516129032258
10,This course was my first encounter with Machine Learning! The course gave me a good understanding of the different ML algorithms used in clustering and retrieval of data! ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.766666666667

14,slightly repetitive of classification course with no real use-case value except lots of math..,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.823529411765
15,"Great course on machine learning, however, left us in middle of learning, Recommender System + Deep Learning Capstone is missing",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.739130434783
16,Some themes are shown very superficially it would be great to go deeper. Despite of this the course is great! Thanks.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.75
17,The course was very engaging and mathematically intensive. It provides background for all the necessary tools one must know to start clustering. Great Course. Will miss this course format as 5 and 6 are cancelled! ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.666666666667
18,Should use pandas instead of Graph Lab Create,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.875
19,Good and deep dive into ML!Absolutely disappointed that the course was delayed and the promise to take it through Course 5 and Capstone Project didn't come through.Not at all happy with that!! ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.641025641026
20,"super one, ",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.666666666667
21, Best Course on ML yet on the Web ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.75
22,"A great course as the other 3 courses in the specialization.This course introduces and make us implement Knn,Kd trees,Gaussian Mixture model and LDA model for clustering and retrieval.The data set is the peoples wiki from the Foundations course and theres a assignment on clustering images too.If you have taken the other 3 an do this with ease and if you haven't taken those i think it will be better to take this course after the other 3.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.511111111111
23,Excellent course! Thanks a lot for the effort in compiling this course... I really enjoyed it!,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.684210526316
24,"Dependence on GraphLab technology is a big minus. The lectures are poorly balanced in terms of difficulty. Apart from that - interesting course, I'm glad I took it.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.705882352941
25,"If you are considering this specialization I would recommend the Andrew Ng course instead and the main reason is that it isn't depend on proprietary ML framework. Despite the good lectures, the assignments don't help you develop the knowledge required for ML developer role.Taking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery, from summer 2016 to summer 2017, finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled. I'm completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.566666666667
26,No good without the missing course and capstone projects,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.888888888889

31,awesome clustering course,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,1.0
32, This specialization is delayed for months now - very annoying! Don't give them money! ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.666666666667
33,very helpful,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,1.0
34,Great course but hard going at times for those of us without a strong maths background. The assignments took me a long time to complete and I think I'll have to revisit some areas as I become more familiar with them to really get the full benefit.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.745098039216
35,"I am taking all courses in the specialization, and this is my fourth. I have been having a great time with materials by both instructors so far, until I came to week 5 of this course.Despite repeated viewing, my understanding of LDA is non-existent. The first section is fine, but starting from Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling, for me at least, the method of instruction has gone off a cliff.I strongly suggest soliciting feedback from learners that narrowly targets the material of this week 5 to determine if it's just me or if this is a wider problem. If it is the latter, perhaps it is time to redesign the lessons of this week.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.511278195489
36,great.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5
37,VERY IMPRESSIVE COURSE,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,1.0
38,This course contain many advance topic which was covered in fast pace by the professor special end lectures. This course contain very important topics of Machine learning could have given more time in explaining things. Thanks professor ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.74358974359
39,Excellent course ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,1.0

43,So Much Concepts to learn and totally worth it!,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.8
44,"This was probably the most challenging course of them all, I thoroughly enjoyed it! Looking forward to dimensionality reduction and the capstone. ",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.76
45,"Thank you, it was a good one",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.875
46,Great course! Very simple and practical.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.75
47,"The course dived into basic and advanced concepts of unsupervised learning. As before, Prof Fox did a great job at explaining things.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.76

52,Best course available till date as MooC,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.857142857143
53,This was another great course. I hope that the instructors indulge in a little bit more theory. Anyway it was a magnificent course. Hope the coming courses are as good as this one.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.648648648649
54,Deep insight into most useful techniques of machine learning.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.8
55,This specific course traded off depth and detail for breadth of topics. Too many ideas were quickly described and not really built up to my liking.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.75
56,"I found that Week 4, Assignment 2 was testing our knowledge in ways that are in opposition to the general ethos of the course.I mean that this course is about gaining insight, intuition and the practical tools for ML, where the smaller details like - knowing which numpy function gives you a random univariate normal distribution - are normally provided for us, so that we can focus on the aforementioned broader, more useful aspects of ML/Clustering.The assignment had good content on the whole but the parts which were chosen for write code here could certainly be improved.I hope this is useful feedback and that the assignment is reviewed so that it doesn't needlessly discourage people.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.541984732824
57,great!,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5

67,One of the best machine learning course I have taken.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.909090909091
68,"Another super course. Though admittedly (for me at least) very difficult to make within the allotted time given for one period of the Course. Lots of advanced stuff that require substantial studies to really comprehend, i.e., it should never be enough just to hack &amp; run the code (that's the easier challenge). Still have a long washing list of topics coming out of this Course that I need (want) to understand better. But at least the background to do so is neatly provided here. So without further ado ... Applause!",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.614678899083

70,Excellent course. ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.666666666667
71,"Some of the interesting topics discussed in this course could be treated substantially more extensive and detailed in order to get a better grip and understanding on them (e.g. Gibbs sampling). After this course, it is a bit dazzling how much different algorithms and methods are available for clustering and retrieval tasks and this course easily could have been subdivided into two or three separate courses on the same topic with a more detailed treatment. Still, about many interesting subjects a tip of the iceberg has been brought to you ... it tastes so good that you would like to have much more!",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.553571428571
72,"Amazing course, really helpful, as a ML researcher you need this kind of foundation",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.8125
73,"The best course in the specialization thus far. Very rich and wide ranging, perfect for the motivated part-time learner who wants to be challenged and have ample reason to revisit the material. I only wish this course had been longer, perhaps shortening the classification course to make room.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.672727272727

93,"Like all the courses in this specialization so far, the material has been good. The reason for only 4 stars rather than 5 is the difficulty in getting questions answered in a timely manner. There don't seem to be any active mentors for this class.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.607843137255

103,"Yet another really excellent course in this series - the best online course I have ever taken. I really appreciate the fairly high level on which it is taught, and the speed with which they go through the material - it is not here to entertain or waste time, but to get straight to the point - what can I do, and how do I use open source tools to do it?

105,"Still a very good course. Week 4 was very tough. The general concept can be understood from a 10,000 feet altitude but the lesson and programming assignment need to be reviewed, maybe with a slower step by step example.As some other student mentioned, it was... brutal.Other than that looking forward to the next course in the specialization!",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.579710144928
106,I did not understand LDA from the course materials.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.7
107,"The course, and indeed the whole specialization, was advertised as not requiring the Graphlab Create toolkit. This is untrue, as the final programming assignment does require it. The general dependence on SFrame is understandable since it is open source, but requiring any interaction with a licensed product (even if temporary and research licenses are available) greatly negatively impacted my experience in this course.

119,Sets a new benchmark for the specialization !!! A great offering on Machine Learning :),-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.666666666667
120,This course rushed through the material at the end. ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.8
121,Very good course nice practical approach. I was kind of surprised that hierarchical clustering was kept at the end and discussed only marginally since it is a widely used approach.I liked the part about LDA but IMHO I would have liked more discussion about fundamental techniques rather than such an advanced method.Too focus on text data. Most of the application I worked on have limited textual data.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.675675675676
122,"The specialization has a good quality on average. I started doing this course immediately after it went open. I had a feeling that the quality of the course went down (questions were often unclear and it took time to figure out what is expected as an answer). However, many problems were solved quite fast and teaching stuff is really helpful. I still would like to see more about MapReduce in-depth in this course. I did not have a feeling that it was covered sufficiently (only theory, no hands-on material). In general, hands-on material was great and useful.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.55652173913
123,"Very nice course, and a great grasp on clustering techniques. If I could just suggest something to improve, it would be the section on LDA and Gibbs: it's very high level and it would be really nice to have some more technical insights on those techniques (perhaps with optional sections, as for other topics).",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.587301587302

128,"please rework in particular week 5, part 2",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.666666666667
129,Another great introduction. The assignments are notably a little bit harder than the previous courses.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.705882352941
130,"I loved the previous 3 courses and what I saw in this course so far seems pretty interesting. I'm really sad that Coursera decided to block access to assignments for not paying users. I really wanted to continue with the specialization but I already purchased another specialization, so I'm going to have to put this course on hold for a now. ",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.536231884058
131,Not for the faint of heart but this course does a really good job of explaining clustering (and retrieval) of images and text. It includes several programming assignments which can be tackled with minimal programming experience if one perseveres.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.697674418605
132,Another great course. Strongly recommend!,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.714285714286

135,Nice course with all the practical stuffs and nice analysis about each topic but practical part of LDA was restricted for GraphLab users only which is a weak fallback and rest everything is fine.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.742857142857
136,Clustering &amp; Retrieval was a lot tougher compared to courses on regression &amp; classification because the match concepts behind this course were too complex. Nevertheless Emily tried to make this course as intuitive as possible,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6

161,"I am taking all courses in the specialization, and this is my fourth. I have been having a great time with materials by both instructors so far, until I came to week 5 of this course.Despite repeated viewing, my understanding of LDA is non-existent. The first section is fine, but starting from Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling, for me at least, the method of instruction has gone off a cliff.I strongly suggest soliciting feedback from learners that narrowly targets the material of this week 5 to determine if it's just me or if this is a wider problem. If it is the latter, perhaps it is time to redesign the lessons of this week.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.511278195489

Lots of advanced stuff that require substantial studies to really comprehend, i.e., it should never be enough just to hack &amp; run the code (that's the easier challenge). Still have a long washing list of topics coming out of this Course that I need (want) to understand better. But at least the background to do so is neatly provided here. So without further ado ...

193,"Some of the interesting topics discussed in this course could be treated substantially more extensive and detailed in order to get a better grip and understanding on them (e.g. Gibbs sampling). After this course, it is a bit dazzling how much different algorithms and methods are available for clustering and retrieval tasks and this course easily could have been subdivided into two or three separate courses on the same topic with a more detailed treatment.
