5781,"Overall , it is a very interesting course.But I would like to say , that there are too many interviews. I think that it is a little bit difficult for some non-native speaker to understand the main and important things from the interview, because some interviewers talked in a very loose way. So I would suggest our teacher , to summarize the main points of those interview in a better way ",CpOs5DyhEea_QBJ9iBnl3w,0.5897435897435898
5782,"Excellent course providing not only the knowledge of algorithms but also useful insights into developing and maintaining recommender systems. Only thing that could use some work is the assignments. Spreadsheet assignment in week 4 is poorly designed as evidenced by many forum threads with people not knowing what is it that the authors actually want . Other than that, that was an extremely helpful course.",CpOs5DyhEea_QBJ9iBnl3w,0.6231884057971014
