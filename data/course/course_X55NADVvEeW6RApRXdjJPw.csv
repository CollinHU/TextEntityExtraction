5640,"This is a good course in swift. The lecture videos goes into some depth, not just skim through the basics. So in that regard it's good. But the quizzes and assignment can be a bit improved. With that said, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested learning iOS development with Swift.",X55NADVvEeW6RApRXdjJPw,0.619047619048

5642,Some videos are blurring,X55NADVvEeW6RApRXdjJPw,0.5
5643,"Week 4 was particularly tough to get through. Instructor seem uninterested, and the constant hair flipping was distracting. Videos came through blurry despite using high quality settings. There was a lot of code to get through that could have been better organized. On a few occasions, I had to back-track through the videos to find something I missed. And, in one area, instructor had to go back and fix something but didn't bother to provide guidance as to were to go and do this yourself. In the end, I gave up following along with the videos and built the app using my own research.",X55NADVvEeW6RApRXdjJPw,0.525
