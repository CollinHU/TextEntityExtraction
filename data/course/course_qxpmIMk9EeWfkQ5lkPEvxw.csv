5653,"Solid introduction with a lot of references. Lot of topics are not deep enough discussed and a lot of additional reading is necessary in order to get a lot out of the course. Furthermore, the presentation style and the language understandability of the lecturer are not very good. Too few exercise questions. Would still recommend it as introduction course and for the high number of good paper references.",qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.5675675675675675

5655,"It's an introductory course to key Pattern Discovery techniques with a comprehensive coverage of important subjects. However, it should be complemented by following the referenced material in order to obtain a wider and more complete picture of the field.",qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.6818181818181818
5656,Great course for beginners without experience in Python programming,qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.7777777777777778

5658,"The explanations are not clear. The course is very theoretical, there's just one obligatory programming task. It's one of the worst courses I have ever enrolled in.",qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.6285714285714286
5659,The course exercises are medium-hard. But the topic coverage is spot on.,qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.6875
5660,"I'd review this course for two parts lectures and programming assignments.Lectures Prof. Jiawei Han is a pioneer of the subject. However, I was expecting a more indepth elaboration of techniques. In almost all his lectures he covered very crucial topics at a near-shallow level. For someone like me, it was a motivation to be learning the subject from him but I was left disappointed a little bit. I felt if i was just to gain a superficial understanding then I would have browsed through any website blog article rather than paying for this course and coming here under his tutelage. I will not expect him to be as thorough as he'd be in his lectures at UIUC although why not! but a more elaborative explanation with more notable examples instead of pointing to the reading material at the end of 4th minute of the lecture will be more fruitful and a better learning experience.The programming assignments are challenging and will definitely open up the thought process towards being able to imagine what patterns mean and how to go about extracting them.",qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.5074626865671642

5662,"I learned a lot from this lecture. And I believe the lecture is excellent except that if he could become a little bit funny, then it would be perfect. Thanks,Clark",qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.8
5663,"Really disappointing. The slides contain a lot of paper references that seem to be of high quality that's the reason I'm giving it 2 stars and not just 1 ... but the course itself is bad it covers many algorithms, but so superficially that you learn nothing; and there are not enough programming assignments to really allow you to get any intuition on the concepts.I would love to see this be turned into a 5-course, 30-week specialization in itself and the professor sure looks like he has the knowledge to fill these 30 weeks ... but as a single course over 4 weeks, it's not good.",qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.5
5664, too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment ,qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,1.0
5665,"I like this course. Its provides a good base for pattern discovery, with useful high level techniques, this can be used as a starting point. Something to improve can be incorporating at least one lesson with best practice coding techniques to solve the practical exercises. ",qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.66
