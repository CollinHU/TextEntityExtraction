5618,"Solid introduction with a lot of references. Lot of topics are not deep enough discussed and a lot of additional reading is necessary in order to get a lot out of the course. Furthermore, the presentation style and the (language) understandability of the lecturer are not very good. Too few exercise questions. Would still recommend it as introduction course and for the high number of good paper references.",qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.552631578947

5620,"It's an introductory course to key Pattern Discovery techniques with a comprehensive coverage of important subjects. However, it should be complemented by following the referenced material in order to obtain a wider and more complete picture of the field.",qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.681818181818
5621,Great course for beginners without experience in Python programming,qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.777777777778
5622,Should be more support in the forum for quiz and assignement,qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.909090909091
5623,"The explanations are not clear. The course is very theoretical, there's just one obligatory programming task. It's one of the worst courses I have ever enrolled in.",qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.628571428571
5624,The course exercises are medium-hard. But the topic coverage is spot on.,qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.6875

5626,"I learned a lot from this lecture. And I believe the lecture is excellent except that if he could become a little bit funny, then it would be perfect. Thanks,Clark",qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.8
5627, too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment ,qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,1.0
5628,"I like this course. Its provides a good base for pattern discovery, with useful high level techniques, this can be used as a starting point. Something to improve can be incorporating at least one lesson with best practice coding techniques to solve the practical exercises. ",qxpmIMk9EeWfkQ5lkPEvxw,0.66
