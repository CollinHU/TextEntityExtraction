5722,This is an excellent course.,7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.833333333333
5723,Very useful to learn the basics of social media analysis (twitter and youtube) with python and R.It's a good course to start.,7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.689655172414
5724,"The course material should be provided on coursera itself. Instead of having to download a 1.8GB dataset from yelp, the two files could have been shared here. ",7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.59375
5725,"A good, basic introduction to Social Media Data Analytics",7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.9
5726,"I'd like to give just one star rating for this course, as it is very far from what I expected. The course expect students to know Python, to know R, but did not go deep enough to help students understand the insight from social media data. In fact, lots of R task can be replaced with Python, so the course could be designed in a much better way that students do not always switch between two programming environments. This course mainly teaches how to download data with keywords, and how to plot graph, not worth the effort of learning. Therefore, I would not recommend this course to anyone.",7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.560975609756
5727,"Far from being a real course, it need polishing, at this point it looks more like a basic tutorial with a few error, perhaps next versions will be better. ",7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.69696969697
5728,"Good overview, could be more robust and thorough!",7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.8
5729,This is an inroductory cousre tou,7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.666666666667
5730,It can be more exhaustive..,7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.833333333333
5731,"Interesting course, could have added a bit more on how to write basic scripts or more ways of social media analytics",7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.863636363636
5732,"Tips you into the direction of great resources, but sometimes lacks in the explanations, leaving most code not explained. Not a deal breaker, and a worthy introduction but a more detailed explanation at times would help.",7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.634146341463
