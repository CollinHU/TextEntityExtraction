5761,Very useful to learn the basics of social media analysis twitter and youtube with python and R.It's a good course to start.,7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.7407407407407407
5762,"The course material should be provided on coursera itself. Instead of having to download a 1.8GB dataset from yelp, the two files could have been shared here. ",7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.59375
5763,"A good, basic introduction to Social Media Data Analytics",7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.9
5764,"I'd like to give just one star rating for this course, as it is very far from what I expected. The course expect students to know Python, to know R, but did not go deep enough to help students understand the insight from social media data. In fact, lots of R task can be replaced with Python, so the course could be designed in a much better way that students do not always switch between two programming environments. This course mainly teaches how to download data with keywords, and how to plot graph, not worth the effort of learning. Therefore, I would not recommend this course to anyone.",7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.5609756097560976
5765,"Far from being a real course, it need polishing, at this point it looks more like a basic tutorial with a few error, perhaps next versions will be better. ",7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.696969696969697

5770,"Tips you into the direction of great resources, but sometimes lacks in the explanations, leaving most code not explained. Not a deal breaker, and a worthy introduction but a more detailed explanation at times would help.",7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,0.6341463414634146
