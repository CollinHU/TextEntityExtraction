5980,"This is not a class for a non-computer scientist or a non-electrical engineer. It's frustrating to learn the material this way, but the information is valuable.",qqRBbiEREeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,0.628571428571
5981,Only two stars because of poor quality of videos.,qqRBbiEREeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,0.6
5982,"Audio quality is very poor, this makes it very difficult to understand, sometimes impossible to understand the professor which is not a native eanglish speaker. His mispronunciation and strugle with words combined with low audio volume makes it almost imposible to understand at times.",qqRBbiEREeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,0.604166666667
5983,"The course gives a very high level overview of hardware security and does not go into particular details. Understandably, hardware labs are not included in this online course and the only practice is basic boolean and modular algebra. Quality of the media and transcripts can be improved. Sound is very low and noisy in some videos which makes it hard to watch on a mobile device. Some videos seems to be cut of too early and week's 6 videos are out of order, which is annoying. Overall it's an okay overview of the topic for someone who is unlikely to apply it at daily job (e.g. software engineer like myself).",qqRBbiEREeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,0.531746031746
5984,"Course contents was good , assignments were challenging . One suggestion is to provide pdf for each classroom session or may be a weekly pdf would be great , It so happened that attending each quiz without pdf it was hard to search from video/transcript back and forth",qqRBbiEREeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,0.68

5990,It was a very nice course. Lots of exposure was given to mathematical ways of analyzing threat.,qqRBbiEREeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,0.736842105263
5991,Complete course in order to have a clear overview of HW security. I would recommend it to all HW engineers or System Engineers as well.,qqRBbiEREeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,0.740740740741

5993,"The most boring course i have ever done in my life... Soporific course, Content interesting, but professor is just reading slides, with reading mistakes every 2-3 words. I would not recommend this course at all.",qqRBbiEREeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,0.627906976744
5994,"Poor presentation skills (mostly reading slides)Unclear and inconsistent in what pre-requisite knowledge is needed for the course (in one place he assumes one does not know digital logic, but then later he assumes you know hardware languages, fpga design, etc.).Was a waste of time, shame on Coursera that pre-requisite knowledge was removed from the site.",qqRBbiEREeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,0.571428571429

5997,"The audio can be difficult to understand. Partially because of the Professor's accent and partially because the recording is poor. If you can get past that, it's a good course and the professor knows his stuff.",qqRBbiEREeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,0.636363636364
5998,The material used for this course is so old that makes me feel I'm taking a course in the 90's. The narration is very dull and therefore hard to follow. Really disappointing. ,qqRBbiEREeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,0.717948717949
