0,Good course. Learned a lot from it. Thanks!,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.7272727272727273
1,This course was great! With good code examples and algorithm applications and also intuition!It's a shame that we couldn't finish planned courses due to busy schedules of instructors as I was really looking forward to the capstone project! ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6739130434782609
2,Nice course with all the practical stuffs and nice analysis about each topic but practical part of LDA was restricted for GraphLab users only which is a weak fallback and rest everything is fine.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.7428571428571429
3,Clustering &amp; Retrieval was a lot tougher compared to courses on regression &amp; classification because the match concepts behind this course were too complex. Nevertheless Emily tried to make this course as intuitive as possible,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6
4,I'm a grad student and I can notice the instructor makes a difference in this course. I fully recommend it.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.7083333333333334
5,awesome course!,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6666666666666666

7,very good! strongly recommend to people who want to start a career on data science or are interested in it,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.9047619047619048
8,The teachers are really amazing. They do not just explain it as if they read a book. They explain the concepts very well,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.68
9,Overall is great. The LDA and Dendrograms lack quality specificity and depth of the previous topics. So sad the Specialization collapsed at 4 courses instead of 6.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5333333333333333
10,This course was my first encounter with Machine Learning! The course gave me a good understanding of the different ML algorithms used in clustering and retrieval of data! ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.7666666666666667

15,"Great course on machine learning, however, left us in middle of learning, Recommender System + Deep Learning Capstone is missing",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.7391304347826086
16,Some themes are shown very superficially it would be great to go deeper. Despite of this the course is great! Thanks.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.75
17,The course was very engaging and mathematically intensive. It provides background for all the necessary tools one must know to start clustering. Great Course. Will miss this course format as 5 and 6 are cancelled! ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6666666666666666
18,Should use pandas instead of Graph Lab Create,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.875
19,Good and deep dive into ML!Absolutely disappointed that the course was delayed and the promise to take it through Course 5 and Capstone Project didn't come through.Not at all happy with that!! ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6410256410256411

21, Best Course on ML yet on the Web ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.75
22,"A great course as the other 3 courses in the specialization.This course introduces and make us implement Knn,Kd trees,Gaussian Mixture model and LDA model for clustering and retrieval.The data set is the peoples wiki from the Foundations course and theres a assignment on clustering images too.If you have taken the other 3 an do this with ease and if you haven't taken those i think it will be better to take this course after the other 3.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5111111111111111
23,Excellent course! Thanks a lot for the effort in compiling this course... I really enjoyed it!,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6842105263157895
24,"Dependence on GraphLab technology is a big minus. The lectures are poorly balanced in terms of difficulty. Apart from that - interesting course, I'm glad I took it.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.7058823529411765
25,"If you are considering this specialization I would recommend the Andrew Ng course instead and the main reason is that it isn't depend on proprietary ML framework. Despite the good lectures, the assignments don't help you develop the knowledge required for ML developer role.Taking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery, from summer 2016 to summer 2017, finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled. I'm completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5666666666666667
26,No good without the missing course and capstone projects,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.8888888888888888

32, This specialization is delayed for months now - very annoying! Don't give them money! ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6666666666666666
33,very helpful,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,1.0
34,Great course but hard going at times for those of us without a strong maths background. The assignments took me a long time to complete and I think I'll have to revisit some areas as I become more familiar with them to really get the full benefit.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.7450980392156863
35,"I am taking all courses in the specialization, and this is my fourth. I have been having a great time with materials by both instructors so far, until I came to week 5 of this course.Despite repeated viewing, my understanding of LDA is non-existent. The first section is fine, but starting from Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling, for me at least, the method of instruction has gone off a cliff.I strongly suggest soliciting feedback from learners that narrowly targets the material of this week 5 to determine if it's just me or if this is a wider problem. If it is the latter, perhaps it is time to redesign the lessons of this week.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5112781954887218
36,great.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5
37,VERY IMPRESSIVE COURSE,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,1.0
38,This course contain many advance topic which was covered in fast pace by the professor special end lectures. This course contain very important topics of Machine learning could have given more time in explaining things. Thanks professor ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.7435897435897436
39,Excellent course ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,1.0

53,This was another great course. I hope that the instructors indulge in a little bit more theory. Anyway it was a magnificent course. Hope the coming courses are as good as this one.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6486486486486487
54,Deep insight into most useful techniques of machine learning.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.8
55,This specific course traded off depth and detail for breadth of topics. Too many ideas were quickly described and not really built up to my liking.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.75
56,"I found that Week 4, Assignment 2 was testing our knowledge in ways that are in opposition to the general ethos of the course.I mean that this course is about gaining insight, intuition and the practical tools for ML, where the smaller details like - knowing which numpy function gives you a random univariate normal distribution - are normally provided for us, so that we can focus on the aforementioned broader, more useful aspects of ML Clustering.The assignment had good content on the whole but the parts which were chosen for write code here could certainly be improved.I hope this is useful feedback and that the assignment is reviewed so that it doesn't needlessly discourage people.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5461538461538461
57,great!,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5

68,"Another super course. Though admittedly for me at least very difficult to make within the allotted time given for one period of the Course. Lots of advanced stuff that require substantial studies to really comprehend, i.e., it should never be enough just to hack &amp; run the code that's the easier challenge . Still have a long washing list of topics coming out of this Course that I need want to understand better. But at least the background to do so is neatly provided here. So without further ado .. Applause!",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6442307692307693

71,"Some of the interesting topics discussed in this course could be treated substantially more extensive and detailed in order to get a better grip and understanding on them e.g. Gibbs sampling . After this course, it is a bit dazzling how much different algorithms and methods are available for clustering and retrieval tasks and this course easily could have been subdivided into two or three separate courses on the same topic with a more detailed treatment. Still, about many interesting subjects a tip of the iceberg has been brought to you .. it tastes so good that you would like to have much more!",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5585585585585585

80,Very good course!,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.75
81,"Overall a good and useful course, however A They could do a much better job regarding LDA, standard Gibbs sampling, and Bayesian model and inference. Many slides on these 3 topics only contained some text and the instructor tried to verbally visualize the related important concepts. Hence not a good use of a video session. B Week 1 and the 1st half of Week 6 were redundant.C It would be much better to have a 7-week course with more topics and may be with some optional videos on Bayesian model, HMM.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5048543689320388

94,"Like all the courses in this specialization so far, the material has been good. The reason for only 4 stars rather than 5 is the difficulty in getting questions answered in a timely manner. There don't seem to be any active mentors for this class.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6078431372549019
95,"excellent material! It would be nice, however, to mention some reading material, books or articles, for those interested in the details and the theories behind the concepts presented in the course. ",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5405405405405406

104,"Yet another really excellent course in this series - the best online course I have ever taken. I really appreciate the fairly high level on which it is taught, and the speed with which they go through the material - it is not here to entertain or waste time, but to get straight to the point - what can I do, and how do I use open source tools to do it?

106,"Still a very good course. Week 4 was very tough. The general concept can be understood from a 10,000 feet altitude but the lesson and programming assignment need to be reviewed, maybe with a slower step by step example.As some other student mentioned, it was... brutal.Other than that looking forward to the next course in the specialization!",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5797101449275363
107,I did not understand LDA from the course materials.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.7
108,"The course, and indeed the whole specialization, was advertised as not requiring the Graphlab Create toolkit. This is untrue, as the final programming assignment does require it. The general dependence on SFrame is understandable since it is open source, but requiring any interaction with a licensed product even if temporary and research licenses are available greatly negatively impacted my experience in this course.

121,This course rushed through the material at the end. ,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.8
122,Very good course nice practical approach. I was kind of surprised that hierarchical clustering was kept at the end and discussed only marginally since it is a widely used approach.I liked the part about LDA but IMHO I would have liked more discussion about fundamental techniques rather than such an advanced method.Too focus on text data. Most of the application I worked on have limited textual data.,-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6756756756756757
123,"The specialization has a good quality on average. I started doing this course immediately after it went open. I had a feeling that the quality of the course went down questions were often unclear and it took time to figure out what is expected as an answer . However, many problems were solved quite fast and teaching stuff is really helpful. I still would like to see more about MapReduce in-depth in this course. I did not have a feeling that it was covered sufficiently only theory, no hands-on material . In general, hands-on material was great and useful.",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.5663716814159292
124,"Very nice course, and a great grasp on clustering techniques. If I could just suggest something to improve, it would be the section on LDA and Gibbs it's very high level and it would be really nice to have some more technical insights on those techniques perhaps with optional sections, as for other topics .",-N44X0IJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,0.6065573770491803

I have been having a great time with materials by both instructors so far, until I came to week 5 of this course.Despite repeated viewing, my understanding of LDA is non-existent. The first section is fine, but starting from Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling, for me at least, the method of instruction has gone off a cliff.I strongly suggest soliciting feedback from learners that narrowly targets the material of this week 5 to determine if it's just me or if this is a wider problem.

I had a feeling that the real teaching started only in the 4th week, with lots of walking around the subject in the beginning. Worth to mention that in contrast to the first 3 courses in Scala specialisation this one is very heavy on visual aspect. You actually have to see the picture, as the voice channel just references it.I can certainly recommend this course to people curious about data analysis.

570,Generally a really good introduction to Spark. What I found disturbing though were the very imbalanced difficulties of the excercises and the rather uninformative test messages that did not help for the implementation. There was no course where I had to search for other peoples suggestions in the forums. Still the course was good -- I would do it again!,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.609375

574,"I don't know what happened but it seems they had technical or some other problem while preparing this course. Some assignments were more oriented to solving marginal problems then using Spark and distributed and parallel computing. And that is really annoying. Previous 3 courses were great, maybe this one will improve.",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.6206896551724138

612,"Very interesting course. Heather presents at just right level of abstraction to my taste and her presentation is very lively so it is easy to stay focused. Formally, this is a course on a particular set of software tools and many such courses are not very useful unless one is to start applying learned skills immdeiately because the material starts getting obsolete the day the course is passed. I believe that this course, however, teaches important priniples that outlive the particular toolkit, in particular the art of reasoning about algorithms on distributed collections, in particular, their performance. One would expect this to be a complex subject but somehow this course makes it feel simple -- which is a good indicator of high quality. ",e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.5223880597014925

629,It's a great course with lots of insight into spark. At first it's confusing - first rdds; then dataframes and later datasets. But this is by no means the instructors' fault. Heather greatly describes in detail what goes on under the hood and why dataframes are way faster than simple rdds and why we have to give up some of our beloved typesafety of scala-land to let catalyst do its magic. Datasets try to bring some of it back. I really enjoyed coding the assignments. Took me ~2hrs each. The tasks were fun and like those you would find in the wild.I already applied some of the skills I learned here at work and successfully implemented a simple recommendation engine that will go to production next week.Highly recommend this course!,e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,0.5629139072847682

Formally, this is a course on a particular set of software tools and many such courses are not very useful unless one is to start applying learned skills immdeiately because the material starts getting obsolete the day the course is passed. I believe that this course, however, teaches important priniples that outlive the particular toolkit, in particular the art of reasoning about algorithms on distributed collections, in particular, their performance.

759,It's a great course with lots of insight into spark. At first it's confusing - first rdds; then dataframes and later datasets. But this is by no means the instructors' fault. Heather greatly describes in detail what goes on under the hood and why dataframes are way faster than simple rdds and why we have to give up some of our beloved typesafety of scala-land to let catalyst do its magic. Datasets try to bring some of it back. I really enjoyed coding the assignments. Took me ~2hrs each.

The python exercises are overall quite well done, even though in some parts they could benefit from clearer explanations thankfully almost always provided in the discussion section . Be careful that often the programming assignments go beyond what has been explained in the lectures and therefore require an active search in the documentation, on online forum such as stack overflow or in the resources section.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5661764705882353

1192,"For me the course's biggest value-adding point is to simply ask us to Google everything on Stack Overflow to complete all the assignments, which has almost nothing to do with the course content. The assignments are also badly designed. In the discussion forum you can see lots of confused frustrated posts. The TA's and mentors are clearly under-resourced to answer all our questions. The videos unfortunately don't teach us much either. The professor + TA's a simply reading off a teleprompter, and they're rushing through everything.

1263,"Very good introduction to Pandas Series and DataFrames for Data Science. Fast paced course with good supplementary materials. The homework is progressively challenging. Sophie the Teaching Assistant is particularly helpful in the forums. I don't recommend this course for those without programming or python scripting experience.

Really nice, pleasant video, but don't expect to learn how to solve the problems, because there is little connection from the problems to the videos.Teaching assistants are hard -working and knowledgable and each has a different way to do things.Very little in the way of effective educational design.But they do create useful questions to answer, if you are stubborn enough not to need actual instruction.The estimate of time required is woefully inadequate.The best thing you can do is lookup Brandon Rhodes on Youtube. He will actually explain Pandas. Expect to invest about four hours in his videos and still have questions.

1267,"The course was helpful in presenting typical problems in data science, but the lectures showed you examples in one area of pandas and the assignments asked questions in different areas of pandas.

1269,"I enjoyed and found all of the lectures helpful, but lack of feedback after submitting assignments was a real problem, especially for the last assignment. A simple response of this was answered incorrectly, points not awarded isn't very constructive and was often frustrating. Bugs in being able to submit the assignment were also frustrating.

Where it falls down though is the assignment auto-grader. It's immensely fussy as I understand it has to be , but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don't sufficiently explicitly define whats expected. This means you spend more than 50% of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so.I would recommend this course, but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future.",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5736434108527132

1297,"The course is fast paced and the videos do not cover all of what is necessary to know to pass the assignments. However, this is not a problem as all the necessary references are given. The problem is the way the programming assignments are designed and the automatic grader, which should definitely be improved. Some times you spend hours to figure out what is wrong and you finally find out that you have a precision error because of using a library function instead of another same purpose or you spend our to manipulate a Pandas dataframe to respond to the specifications, except that all that time is wasted as the grader will accept the first version even if the index does not respond to the requirement for instance . So, if you want to take it, prepare to fight with the grader. Positive point Excellent help on the forums, you will not be left alone. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5

1341,"I certainly learnt a lot through this course. The hands on oriented approach of this course works wonders for those who intend to dig deeper and improve their Python programming. The lectures are crisp and clear, but the main learning happens while doing the weekly assignments. Each assignment forces us to go search for content beyond what has been taught in the lectures and in this process we find new things. Also, the lecturer informed us about some good reference books for individual learning. I look forward to taking part two of this course. The mentors in the discussions forum are quite active and helpful. The forum was of big help to me for clearing the assignments. The only flaw I found was that the autograder does not clearly define our mistakes and that's where the mentors come in and explain in the discussion forum. This part could be better automated.

I was even able to apply some of this knowledge at work after week 2 and I do not have a technical job - I do this on my own time .It did feel a little complicated at some times.

1561,"A course which has great assignments. However, the video itself is a bit boring. Most of the time, my motivation to learn this course is just doing its assignments. At the same time, the assignments are somewhat difficult for those who are not familiar with Python, but for me it's just OK. What I want to make complaints about the assignments is that sometimes the Autograder is so rigid that I have to try one question over and over again until the Autograder feels happy, and for me, sometimes the gap between correct answer and incorrect answer isn't so large...And finally, thank you, teacher Christopher Brooks!

1562,"Lectures were interesting and well put together, however the assignments and the knowledge required for the assignments were not covered in the lecture material. While I can appreciate that every course will require some elements of self-learning and exploration, this felt a step too far. My sense is that if you have some experience in the actual topics covered by the course, and are looking to verify your knowledge with a certificate, you will be fine. However if you are hoping to actually learn about the topics, you are going to have to work very hard.

1778,"For me the course's biggest value-adding point is to simply ask us to Google everything on Stack Overflow to complete all the assignments, which has almost nothing to do with the course content. The assignments are also badly designed. In the discussion forum you can see lots of confused frustrated posts. The TA's and mentors are clearly under-resourced to answer all our questions. The videos unfortunately don't teach us much either. The professor + TA's a simply reading off a teleprompter, and they're rushing through everything.

1782,The video classes are informative and very clear. The exercises during the classes were thorough and allowed me to apprehend the concepts at a good pace. My only problem were the auto-graded exams.

1877,"The course is fast paced and the videos do not cover all of what is necessary to know to pass the assignments. However, this is not a problem as all the necessary references are given. The problem is the way the programming assignments are designed and the automatic grader, which should definitely be improved. Some times you spend hours to figure out what is wrong and you finally find out that you have a precision error because of using a library function instead of another same purpose or you spend our to manipulate a Pandas dataframe to respond to the specifications, except that all that time is wasted as the grader will accept the first version even if the index does not respond to the requirement for instance . So, if you want to take it, prepare to fight with the grader. Positive point Excellent help on the forums, you will not be left alone. ",RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,0.5

No prior experience required.' is very misleading and if you do not have any experience, you will struggle a lot especially to complete week 3 &amp; 4 assignments. It makes you think and requires a lot of self-study, which is a good way to enhance our knowledge and skills, however assignments are way too challenging for those who are 'beginners' or have little real-world experience.

The lectures are crisp and clear, but the main learning happens while doing the weekly assignments. Each assignment forces us to go search for content beyond what has been taught in the lectures and in this process we find new things. Also, the lecturer informed us about some good reference books for individual learning. I look forward to taking part two of this course. The mentors in the discussions forum are quite active and helpful. The forum was of big help to me for clearing the assignments. The only flaw I found was that the autograder does not clearly define our mistakes and that's where the mentors come in and explain in the discussion forum. This part could be better automated.

I finally found the library and documentation pages that were talked about in week 03. this seems a good place to actually LOOK at them but I think they should be mention with the first excersise in week 01... here we put in 'import xyz'. this has many many functions in it that allow us to shorten the work that we do. In week 03 we open the documentation file and a library file to see how to navigate those especially the documentation files ,bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.5151515151515151

2325,"This course was pretty okay, I'd say. I did learn several new things and consider myself introduced to the world of python. Unfortunately, as a BRAND NEW programmer, it was, at times hard to keep up. There were a number of elements that weren't sufficiently explained during the lessons assignments presumably because we 'should' have a basic understanding of coding already...I guess? . If this is the case, some outside study background research may be necessary, at times. The instructor was actually relatively helpful, though the forum format makes for lag in help time, meaning you could be stuck on a problem or with a question for a while again...outside study research required . Overall, as I said, I learned things- yay! This course is for the very patient, however, and may likely by too simplistic for those with programming experience, too difficult for those who have never coded or maybe just right for some lucky few.",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.5319148936170213

I liked the fact that I could read the comments before watching the video and that they were enough of a primer for the lecture. I wish there would have been a similar problem like the one for the database but one where we would need to write from scratch in order to get used to the different things introduced that week. This was great as it is one of the few that use Python 3 and as a beginner I wanted to learn the new first and then work out the differences later on.

2494,"This course was pretty okay, I'd say. I did learn several new things and consider myself introduced to the world of python. Unfortunately, as a BRAND NEW programmer, it was, at times hard to keep up. There were a number of elements that weren't sufficiently explained during the lessons assignments presumably because we 'should' have a basic understanding of coding already...I guess? . If this is the case, some outside study background research may be necessary, at times. The instructor was actually relatively helpful, though the forum format makes for lag in help time, meaning you could be stuck on a problem or with a question for a while again...outside study research required . Overall, as I said, I learned things- yay! This course is for the very patient, however, and may likely by too simplistic for those with programming experience, too difficult for those who have never coded or maybe just right for some lucky few.",bfE3GBnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,0.5319148936170213

2498,This was great. I had to do some more reading into the videos and spend more time trying to produce output in different formats to learn more. I liked the fact that I could read the comments before watching the video and that they were enough of a primer for the lecture. I wish there would have been a similar problem like the one for the database but one where we would need to write from scratch in order to get used to the different things introduced that week. This was great as it is one of the few that use Python 3 and as a beginner I wanted to learn the new first and then work out the differences later on.

The presentations are awfully boring, there is little interaction of the material unlike Ng who is deriving the math on screen . Hinton is basically just reading off the crowded slides. Very poor didactic style. I would even go so far as to say that the approach is unscientific no definitions, derivations, examples. Terms just pop out of the blue.If you already know the topic well, you might gain additional insight from a pundit. Quizes are nice puzzles that need some thinking and math knowledge. Programming tasks are not even in the same ballpark as Ng's.

One of the best features was his commentary on the intuition behind why these methods work. Since he came up with a number of these ideas himself or was part of the team that did he has a unique insight into how you can think about a problem to motivate a possibly fruitful approach. The other aspect of the course that I liked best was Hinton's copious use of real-world examples and feedback about which methods worked well on certain problems and why.

However, Professor Hinton motivated everything so well that I always wanted to understand what was going on, and so frequently would pause the videos while I consulted other online resources to find out more about the topic at hand.

I think I was missing intuition and having many more concrete examples might have helped. On the other hand, for example, I already knew a few ideas behind convolution neural networks and the lectures cleared a lot up. The explanations are solid, though perhaps graze over some important things for newcomers. The next step for me is probably to rewatch weeks 11-14 now that I'm no longer a newcomer on that topic...",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5107913669064749

There were a number of technical glitches on the quizzes, unfortunately, and often the wording on quizzes was unnecessarily confusing but still manageable so I dock it a single star. Also the visual organization of the lecture slides is a little shoddy compared to many other versions of nearly identical slides from Hinton's courses found online elsewhere. On the mobile app, many of the quiz questions were impossible to complete because graphics could not load.

Starting around weeks 11-12 the lectures become a bit vague, and I had quite some difficulty understanding them. It seemed to me that these lectures were hastily created even though I can only imagine how much work creating this course must have been . Furthermore, the lab sessions are rather easy and the provided code is annoying to work with systematically since they output results as printed text instead of something re-usable. This makes experimentation like grid searches a bit tedious. Besides these minor things, the course is quite good.Note that deep learning topics are only briefly touched, but you won't obtain the skills for training and designing them yourself without further exploration of the topics.Finally, many thanks to the teachers!",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5625

Some of the explanations were a little mysterious to this student e.g. how can you discuss sampling of restricted Boltzmann machines, which are essentially bipartite Ising models, without mentioning conditional probability? . However, Professor Hinton motivated everything so well that I always wanted to understand what was going on, and so frequently would pause the videos while I consulted other online resources to find out more about the topic at hand. The programming assignments were also well-designed, so that I found myself forced to confront various aspects of the models and algorithms that I'd thought I'd understood the first time round but in fact had not.

Also the visual organization of the lecture slides is a little shoddy compared to many other versions of nearly identical slides from Hinton's courses found online elsewhere. On the mobile app, many of the quiz questions were impossible to complete because graphics could not load.

3271,"Hinton is the reason we use neural nets today. He's advanced the theory and continues to explore new approaches. This is eye opening. He motivates the theory behind each approach he advances very well. Unfortunately, the practical side of the pedagogy of this course is not as strong. It is understandable to not turn this into a programming class. However, there is too much of a gap between even a clear explanation of theory and actual practice. This could be remedied with more hands on exercises not necessarily coding, though coding is a fine way to test understanding. .",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5357142857142857

3303,"This course is good, unique and relevant for machine learning today. Some things can be improved though. Starting around weeks 11-12 the lectures become a bit vague, and I had quite some difficulty understanding them. It seemed to me that these lectures were hastily created even though I can only imagine how much work creating this course must have been . Furthermore, the lab sessions are rather easy and the provided code is annoying to work with systematically since they output results as printed text instead of something re-usable. This makes experimentation like grid searches a bit tedious. Besides these minor things, the course is quite good.Note that deep learning topics are only briefly touched, but you won't obtain the skills for training and designing them yourself without further exploration of the topics.Finally, many thanks to the teachers!",meQ0ic9uEeWu4RLrx6VBYw,0.5625

3616,There are steps that are missing at times which require you to scour for help. There are also quirks that aren't mentioned that other students have to point out. Unaddressed questions in the discussion board required escalation. Feels rushed and it's hard to learn for a beginner. Feels like you're just going through the motions and copy and pasting code.,52blABnqEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,0.5633802816901409
3617,I am a bit disappointed by this course. I was expecting a more fast paced course with more information regarding Angular. Unfortunately in the videos there is a lot of time spent on unnecessary details and reading out loud the source code. The exercises are quite basic and they did not pose real challenges - except for errors coming from mismatched packages or mistakes in configuration files. Also I think that the level of support provided by the mentors of this course is lacking. Mentors are quite absent and very late in providing any help in the forums so the students have to kind of counsel one another - that is sometimes good but a proper class also requires a good level of supervision.All in all I think this is an OK course that is mostly geared to the uninitiated. It needs some serious work to make it a great course.,52blABnqEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,0.525

If you don't like to switch up and turn on a dime then this course is not for you. I had trouble aplenty and yet the point seemed to be stay flexible, be prepared to use obscure tools that are supposed to make the site work better but who knows exactly what is happening under the hood , expect change and adversity, become an expert at debugging that crappy code and refactoring everything at the drop of a hat.

4069,There are steps that are missing at times which require you to scour for help. There are also quirks that aren't mentioned that other students have to point out. Unaddressed questions in the discussion board required escalation. Feels rushed and it's hard to learn for a beginner. Feels like you're just going through the motions and copy and pasting code.,52blABnqEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,0.5633802816901409
4070,I am a bit disappointed by this course. I was expecting a more fast paced course with more information regarding Angular. Unfortunately in the videos there is a lot of time spent on unnecessary details and reading out loud the source code. The exercises are quite basic and they did not pose real challenges - except for errors coming from mismatched packages or mistakes in configuration files. Also I think that the level of support provided by the mentors of this course is lacking. Mentors are quite absent and very late in providing any help in the forums so the students have to kind of counsel one another - that is sometimes good but a proper class also requires a good level of supervision.All in all I think this is an OK course that is mostly geared to the uninitiated. It needs some serious work to make it a great course.,52blABnqEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,0.525

First of all I didn't like the idea of building over one website, if you didn't get what was happening so you already ruined a part of the total website which you will continue building over during the whole coursesecond the assignments requirements requires additional searches which wasn't explained in details during the session third the explanation is so boring and you can easily lose your concentration because of poor communication skills forth the assignments requires two many details really, Also I need to get the code of other classmates using get source code option on my google chrome and then run it again , there are much efficient ways to handle that like running the delivered assignment directly on the server ",ycQnChn3EeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.512987012987013

Sure, we had lectures explaining things, but in the end we mostly had to copy-and-paste code and confirm that it worked. There should have been many, many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understanding.Perhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate. To really understand and absorb this stuff, I'll need to spend a lot of time with the additional resources.

Muppala for this incredible course.There are indeed many great resources for learning any of the technologies and tools used in this course and specialization. But what is unique about this specialization, is that it gives us not only solid foundations needed to use these tools, but, just as importantly, a clear context as to where a certain tool or its segment is used. Sure enough, having in mind the broader context, it is much easier to understand all of the segments individually.I would also like to thank Kre??imir and all the other mentors that helped make this course a pleasant experience.I can't wait for the next course on Angular JS to start!",ycQnChn3EeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.5035460992907801

A lot of very useful stuff was covered, but I feel like it went too fast.But I think it could be better connected together in terms of broad principles, rather than just going through tons of particular examples. I still don't feel like I have a mental framework for how to lay out a web page, other than the basics of the 12-column grid system. It all seemed very ad hoc.It's by no means a bad course, and I still gave it four stars since the material is very useful, but I definitely think it could be improved upon.Also, the ratio of homework lectures is way too low. I definitely think the course should put more emphasis on actually creating websites oneself.

5169,"Although the course structure and information is great, the course exercise and grading organization has a lot of space for improvement. Current structure doesn't make it possible for the learner to determine the speed. All the parts are equally important. You have to carefully go through hours of instructions. Each week and the assignment builds on what you have done before, but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations. This causes a lot of confusion.Peer evaluation rules are not shown before you submit your work. After submitting my work, I discovered that there are requirements that were not in the assignment.",ycQnChn3EeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.5409836065573771

There should have been many, many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understanding.Perhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate. To really understand and absorb this stuff, I'll need to spend a lot of time with the additional resources.

But what is unique about this specialization, is that it gives us not only solid foundations needed to use these tools, but, just as importantly, a clear context as to where a certain tool or its segment is used. Sure enough, having in mind the broader context, it is much easier to understand all of the segments individually.I would also like to thank Kre??imir and all the other mentors that helped make this course a pleasant experience.I can't wait for the next course on Angular JS to start!",ycQnChn3EeWDtQoum3sFeQ,0.5035460992907801

I still don't feel like I have a mental framework for how to lay out a web page, other than the basics of the 12-column grid system. It all seemed very ad hoc.It's by no means a bad course, and I still gave it four stars since the material is very useful, but I definitely think it could be improved upon.Also, the ratio of homework lectures is way too low.

Each week and the assignment builds on what you have done before, but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations.

5897,"This course serves as a great introduction to mobile web development. Notice that multiplatform in this case means iOS and Android no Windows Phone and you do get a bit of hands on work on Android SDK and XCode, although mostly for setting up both environments. Professor Muppala is again outstanding in the class, covering a wide range of topics combined with multiple exercises which in my case really furthered my understanding. One thing I believe could improve would be having either at least one assignment forcing you to deploy to Android and another one to iOS. In my case, it was just too comfortable to simply deploy to an iOS device and barely look at Android. Also, the vibration function should not be part of an assignment, as not everyone will have a device to test it and neither of the emulators really use it. One final recommendation for those pressed with time I was able to follow Professor Muppala quite easily while playing the lectures at 1.75x it's funny how slow he seems to speak when I set in back to 1x - .",-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.5074626865671642
5898,Good,-gcU5xn4EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,1.0

I learned the basics of text retrieval and search engines. I went from knowing nothing, to having a working sense of how search engine algorithms work. It was a challenging course for me, but very much worth the time and effort I put into it. It was like pulling back the curtain on the code behind Google, Netflix, and Amazon searches, and that has made me think of the world in a different way.

Very practical and useful stuff. It had me thirsting for more information and I found myself reading unassigned material. I became particularly interested in Anova and continuing to read up on it even though I am done the course.I would take this course again.

6195,This course failed greatly to balance the workload by week. The third week which I think was the most important one have too many information to learn and assimilate whereas the first two weeks could be rearranged to start multivariate regression earlier. Another proof of week 3 issue the related swirl exercises start in week2 2 of them and finish in week4 2 more exercises !!!!!I think one of the most important expertise and knowledge that a data scientist must know and master was unfairly squeezed in one week leaving no time for the learner student to do more search exercises on the subject. ,a_xPWXNVEeWxvQr3acyajw,0.5462962962962963

Brian Caffo's lectures in Statistical Inference were good; in this course they seem to veer left and right rather than get straight to the essence of whatever subject he is lecturing about. A more structured final project would have been helpful. The instructions on this project weren't quite so blunt as to say Take this data set, do some regression-y stuff and come back with something about these two variables, but that's basically as far as our instructions went. It could have been a great learning experience to have a more detailed guide through the construction of a regression analysis, but instead an assignment which was 40% of our grade was put together as an afterthought. It was the assignment equivalent of stopping in the 7-11 a block away from a birthday party to buy a card.Also, in terms of delivering the content Mr. Caffo needs to structure his slide video arrangements so that he is not standing in front of the text.

A person leaves this course, and even more so the inference course, not being very clear one where their new capabilities lie in the spectrum, and without the strongest sense of how to experiment with linear models. One case in point of the the huge strengths and a slight weakness of this course -- Professor Caffo mentions the wonderfully tantalizing fact that the application of linear models can get you most of the way to the top of a Kaggle competition.

6363,This course failed greatly to balance the workload by week. The third week which I think was the most important one have too many information to learn and assimilate whereas the first two weeks could be rearranged to start multivariate regression earlier. Another proof of week 3 issue the related swirl exercises start in week2 2 of them and finish in week4 2 more exercises !!!!!I think one of the most important expertise and knowledge that a data scientist must know and master was unfairly squeezed in one week leaving no time for the learner student to do more search exercises on the subject. ,a_xPWXNVEeWxvQr3acyajw,0.5462962962962963
6364,"Great course. The content might be improved to be more clear. I feel that sometimes the instructor assumes we are familiar with some concepts we have not seen in previous courses.

6365,"I am no used to this educational system so I find difficult to follow without any proof or demonstration of the mathematical tools. I find proofs necessary for a good understanding of concepts. Another benefit of proof will be to have a more rigorous framework for variable names in the explanations.

The instructor is not showing us the way we should think about developing programs in NodeJS, but he insists on using PowerPoint slides to show us how to code! It's 2016, and there are way better mediums for communicating with your students. Simply copying and pasting code and explaining what every line does is not the right way of teaching any concept, especially when you are dealing with a new technology. For the start, the instructor can actually type the code and explain what goes through his mind during each step. That way anyone can follow his problem solving methods and benefit from the course. I had to take other online courses on Code School and Pluralsight just to understand what's going on, and later come back to finish the homework. ",ngZrURn5EeWwrBKfKrqlSQ,0.5345911949685535

7055,The course is very good explained. However the practice relies a lot in code that cannot be explained like applets or mapping components...

I would have my headphones in, volume up so I could hear the lecturers clearly, then when the next video would start there would be this terrible music that started very abruptly.

7202,"Although I agree that the mapping library that is used for the programming assignments adds something visually interesting to the course, I felt that it added an unnecessary level complexity when it came understanding the object-oriented aspects of the language. I spent a lot of time trying to understand how to use a library that I won't likely use again just to be able to apply the core programming concepts being taught in that lesson.

There was too much focus on high-level details of the course project and too little attention paid to technical details. This rendered the lectures simplistic, boring, and sometimes a waste of time. This felt like an introductory level course, made more difficult through poor teaching.Also, the slick web interface was slightly difficult to navigate in comparison to other Coursera courses.",NFiJtRnpEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,0.5233644859813084

I also didn't like the programming assignments one big project . They were not challenging at all much too easy , and also not really interesting repetition and expansion of an assignment at Dukes . You are also not writing that much code, because you get too much from them, where you just have to add a little here and there. Liked, that they divided the videos into different stages core, concept challenge, when I struggled , so you only have to watch the videos, that you find necessary.I hope the next course will be more interesting and challenging.",NFiJtRnpEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,0.5133333333333333

You will just be given lots of names with no explanation whatsoever.I often felt really angry at the teacher because of the way he would introduce entire prediction models without explaining anything about them. Also, I really didn't like the fact that the course is centered on caret, a shortcut package to do stuff fast. Before doing things fast I need to know what I am doing!

7620,"As as standalone course on machine learning, it's probably best to take Andrew Ng's class on Coursera. This course mostly teaches the basic usage of the caret package. It is too short to cover more fundamental topics in machine learning, like how to choose an algorithm based on the problem and the data.I took this class just because I was engaged in the Data Science specialization. I wanted to clear the Capstone project and get the Data Science specialization certificate.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.532608695652174

7626,In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion such as regression models and stat. inference . The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms. Also I think it's a bit out of date because there is no references to xgbboost which is now dominating many Kaggle contests,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.5555555555555556
7627,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6
7628,This is a very useful course in Machine Learning that teaches us how to use the R based packages such as CARET for applying machine learning techniques.

7630,"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.569620253164557

For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better.

7791,Very informative course.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.75
7792,One of the most valuable courses in the specialization!,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.7
7793,"I enjoyed a lot this module, I'll use at my daily work some of the features I learned",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6666666666666666
7794,Excellent introduction to machine learning. I feel that I have a good basic foundation to start building upon.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.8
7795,Nice course.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6666666666666666
7796,In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion such as regression models and stat. inference . The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms. Also I think it's a bit out of date because there is no references to xgbboost which is now dominating many Kaggle contests,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.5555555555555556
7797,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6
7798,This is a very useful course in Machine Learning that teaches us how to use the R based packages such as CARET for applying machine learning techniques. The course project helps understand how these techniques are applied in real world applications and develop useful insights. ,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6382978723404256
7799,Course content feels upside down. You'll learn about machine algorithm specifics and caveats before anyone explains what the said algorithm actually hopes to achieve.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6428571428571429
7800,"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.569620253164557
7801,Good overview of available techniques and the Caret package. Will get you started in machine learning.,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.7777777777777778

7811,The mathematics in this course are at a high level similar to Statistical Inference - and are presented at a pace that is challenging without significant background in the field. There is little guidance presented on the methods required. It is recommended that students source out plenty of support material intro to statistical inference and similar .,H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.559322033898305

7814,"This was a very good introduction to machine learning and how to use machine learning packages in R. It would have been better if the class had been longer than four weeks, but I learned a lot for the length of the course.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.7391304347826086

7824,"Wish to have more systematic structure, detail information and hands-on exercises.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6666666666666666
7825,"I'm somewhat disappointed. I attend almost all other courses in this specialization except of data product and this one is, on my opinion, the weakest one. A lot of links to useful information though. This is more reference guide rather than a real training course. I can say even more, initially I start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one. For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better. In lectures on some concepts like regularization I'm pretty sure I would not understand anything if I had not been familiar with the subject before.. ",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.5298013245033113
7826,"Class materials and videos are confusing and do not go into enough detail. Assignments require a lot of search of extra information outside course materials. Also, the length that is needed to complete the assignments vary widely week to week.",H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,0.6363636363636364

Short course, so there is not much time to give challenging assignments that would prepare you for a job or industry level skill in this topic. The student enrollment was limited compared to my other courses on Coursera and hence the discussion forum was not active.

9220,"The class has a lot of good information but I felt as though it was a bit disorganized. There were way too many people taking the class but not enough to grade the assignments. On the plus side I was able to switch to another session of the class while keeping all of my progress so hopefully my assignments will get graded this time around and I'll be able to complete the class. If an auto-grader or a way to ensure that everybody who turns in assignments will get those assignments graded back quickly could be implemented this would be a stellar class.

However, if I had been a beginner in any of these topics, I'm not sure if this course would have been enough. Not much time is spent on clarifying HTML and CSS, i.e., there were a lot of topics untouched. Additionally, while the instructor's videos were excellent, the professor did not participate in course discussions at all.

The videos are too short and the samples demonstrated in the videos aren't thoroughly explained. For instance, the speaker often only says what she is doing but not WHY she is doing it or what the function of a particular parameter is. I felt left alone and forced to google. In my opinion it cannot be the purpose to make your student google basic things that could easily be integrated into the course.Considering that this is labelled as a beginner course I was expecting much more theoretical input. Other courses offer additional slides and scripts that are aligend with the course videos and allow the students to look things up.",6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,0.5289855072463768

9981,This is a good course. I have done stats in the past so i was using this as a refresher but also to advance my python skills a bit more. I think you should take an introduction course to python first. you will get more out of the coding examples. I suggest the Intro to Python by the University of Toronto at Coursera. I found that to be an excellent course.I find that in these lectures they do a great job in explaining the stats theory. They do not dwell to much into the science behind it but more the applicability. This is all good.

10091,This is a good course. I have done stats in the past so i was using this as a refresher but also to advance my python skills a bit more. I think you should take an introduction course to python first. you will get more out of the coding examples. I suggest the Intro to Python by the University of Toronto at Coursera. I found that to be an excellent course.I find that in these lectures they do a great job in explaining the stats theory. They do not dwell to much into the science behind it but more the applicability. This is all good.

Moreover, students are supposed to learn these concepts to get a good grade from first quiz, although they know nothing about programming.I had some programming experience, so I was already familiar with these subjects.
